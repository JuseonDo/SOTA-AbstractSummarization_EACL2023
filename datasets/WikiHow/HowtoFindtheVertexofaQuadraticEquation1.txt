@summary
identify the values of a, b, and c. in a quadratic equation, the x2 term = a, the x term = b, and the constant term (the term without a variable) = c. let's say you're working with the following equation: y = x2 + 9x + 18.

@summary
use the vertex formula for finding the x-value of the vertex.

@summary
plug the x-value into the original equation to get the y-value.

@summary
write down the x and y values as an ordered pair.

 In this example, a = 1, b = 9, and c = 18., The vertex is also the equation's axis of symmetry. The formula for finding the x-value of the vertex of a quadratic equation is x = -b/2a. Plug in the relevant values to find x. Substitute the values for a and b. Show your work:


x=-b/2a
x=-(9)/(2)(1)
x=-9/2

, Now that you know the x-value, just plug it in to the original formula for the y value. You can think of the formula for finding the vertex of a quadratic function as being (x, y) = . This just means that to get the y value, you have to find the x value based on the formula and then plug it back into the equation. Here's how you do it:


y = x2 + 9x + 18
y = (-9/2)2 + 9(-9/2) +18
y = 81/4 -81/2 + 18
y = 81/4 -162/4 + 72/4
y = (81 - 162 + 72)/4
y = -9/4

, Now that you know that x = -9/2, and y = -9/4, just write them down as an ordered pair: (-9/2, -9/4). The vertex of this quadratic equation is (-9/2, -9/4). If you were to draw this parabola on a graph, this point would be the minimum of the parabola, because the x2 term is positive.
