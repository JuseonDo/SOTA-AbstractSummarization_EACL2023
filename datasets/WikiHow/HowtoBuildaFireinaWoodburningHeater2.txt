 Make sure they're perpendicular to the pane of the closed doors, or fire box opening. These large logs will be the bed of the fire and contain the embers to feed it.
 This log should be about the diameter of your forearm, and it should rest parallel to the pane of the glass door or fireplace opening, closer to the opening of the firebox.


This cross-bar will hold the other firewood and keep an air vent open where the fire can draw fresh air to feed it from underneath.
 Alternatively, use other tinder like dried twigs or wood shavings as a base.
 Do not put any larger logs or fuel on top yet. If you can stack the kindling in a grid fashion, leaving plenty of space in between for air to pass through.
 Make sure that the kindle starts to burn — you'll want to hear crackling noises.
 Again, these logs should be about half the diameter of your forearm, resting parallel with the cross-bar. Keep this arrangement at all times: two logs, one cross-bar on top and firewood held by the cross-bar.
