 If you want to be a snow princess, you have to love snow.;
, If you (for example) walk by a polar bear exhibit at the zoo, stare at it longer than most people and read it's exhibit description.
 All princesses are sweet and honest to other people and animals.
 If this is not possible, wear a blue or white blouse with jean shorts. You could also try painting your nails white and blue. Do add a little extra touch, you can put on a little white eyeliner and blue eyeshadow.
 Be creative with it, too. Avoid feathers, and use snow crystals (or something that looks like a snow crystal.)

,, If you live somewhere where there is snow, be attracted to the snow. If you're forced to stay inside, stare out the window and ask if you can go outside. If you can go outside, just play around and stay out as long as you're comfortable with.
 These dog breeds include Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, Canadian Inuit Dog, Chinook, Eurohound, Greenland dog, Greyster Sled Dog, Labrador Husky, Mackenzie River Husky, etc.
 Ice Princess and Snow Princess are sisters because they are both cold!

,, Princesses like you have high self-confidence and inner/outer beauty.
