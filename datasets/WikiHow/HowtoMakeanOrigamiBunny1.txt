 Anything will work, so long as it isn't square. You can use other things like business cards, a dollar bill, or a whole piece of paper. Do note that a small paper will be more likely to hop, but a bigger paper will be easier to fold.

Origami paper is best, especially because it comes with neat patterns. Two differently colored sides can sometimes make mistakes easier to see.;
,, Then fold the top left corner to the opposite side, just as before., You should see two creases making an X., This will create a rectangle at the edge of your paper., You should see an X with a line through it and several small triangles emerging. Got it?, They should pop in towards the center. This is what's going to give your bunny its bounce., Right now it should look like a house. Rectangular on one end, triangular on the other., The sides will go under the points of the triangle on top. It's fine to leave a small space in between the edges. Now the "house" should look like an arrow., The point of the "arrow" should still be showing., Make a solid crease with your finger., Then, fold both points of the triangle into the center. See the ears?, Now that you see where the face should go, feel free to draw one on!, Then, let go! How much air can your bunny get?
