 So it is recommended that you take a shower before hand. After you do this, comb tangles out of wet hair. Apply a volumizing mousse and heat protectant. This will be all the product you need. Clip three sections of the top layer of you hair. Blow dry the bottom layer of your hair with a round brush until it is completely dry.;
, Dry them 25% of the way and roll them in large plastic rollers to create volume. You must wait until these are completely dry to take them down.
 Himegyaru curls are typically tight but not too put together.
 If you have thin hair, you will want to make them tighter to add more volume.
 Next, gently take random curls and separate them to give them a messy yet sophisticated look.
, If they are not, wait until they are or the effect will not be the same.
 If you want more volume, do minimal teasing to the roots of the rolled sections.
, This style is very versatile and you can do many things with it. these include ponytails, buns, and braids.
