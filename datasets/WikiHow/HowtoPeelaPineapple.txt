 Sniff the base. It should smell slightly sweet.;
, It should yield slight pressure to show that it is ripe., You will discard most of the surface, so you don’t need to scrub it very hard.
 You will need a very sharp chef’s knife to peel a pineapple well.
 Place your knife one-fourth inch (0.6cm) below the leaves. Slice until you reach the leaves.
 Lift them up through the center leaves and discard them. You can use the remaining center leaves to hold the pineapple steady as you cut it.


Some cooks suggest cutting the entire top off. You can do this also, but you should be careful not to let your hand slip from the top of the pineapple. Cutting the pineapple releases a lot of slippery juice.
 You can cut in a slight outward facing arc in order to save more pineapple fruit.
 Turn, slice and repeat until you have removed the peel and only the eyes remain.



Discard the skin of the pineapple in your compost or the garbage can.
 Removing just the eyes will reserve the largest amount of fruit.
 Cut in at a 45-degree angle just underneath the eyes.
 Cut in at a 45-degree angle in the opposite direction. When you slice this groove into the pineapple, the line of eyes will come free, keeping most of the sweet flesh on the rind.
 It will start to look like a spiral.
 When you have worked your way around the pineapple, you will have a beautiful spiral pattern and bright yellow flesh., Cut the center core of the pineapple away in a vertical slice. It is hard and not very sweet.
