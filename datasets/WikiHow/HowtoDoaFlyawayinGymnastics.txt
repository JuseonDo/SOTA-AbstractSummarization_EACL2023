 Do tuck jumps while going forwards. Do this like you are flying off the bar, but your just jumping forwards in a tuck.;
, (Preferably a coach.) Ask her/him to help you do a back tuck into a soft, fluffy pit full of foam cubes. Remember to jump high, and up. Don't arch or curl up into a squished ball––just tuck.
 Bring your feet up to the bar, and let go. Try the same thing on a high bar.
,


Tuck ups: Start in a hollow, and bring your feet to your chest in a tuck. Keep your core tight.
Tuck backs: Do a tuck jump like a back tuck, but control yourself down to the floor.
 Have them help you flyaway, and remember to go high, and up.
, This makes it safer for a wrong landing, especially if it's your first time doing a normal flyway.
 Don't tuck your legs up yet.
 Then do a back tuck, as if you're doing it into a pit without a jump.
 Grab your legs, and tuck in your head, as well as your legs.
 Squeeze them together, and try to stick your landing.
