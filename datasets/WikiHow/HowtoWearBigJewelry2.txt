 Big bracelets are best worn on days when you won’t be using your hands much, or if you don’t mind pushing bracelets up your arms or taking them off for important tasks. They may be cute, but they can be a hassle--even typing on a computer can be cumbersome when wearing a bracelet--so if you're planning on wearing any, get ready to commit.
 This detail can be a huge improvement to your outfits, helping you look more put together.
 If the inside of the bracelet irritates your skin, take a bottle of clear nail polish and apply several coats to the inner ring. If that doesn't ease the irritation, consider long sleeves.
 Unlike big necklaces, big bracelets can be worn fashionably several at a time. However, you should still be conscious of patterns, sizes, etc. Ask yourself questions like "Do these colors complement one another?" and "Can I really keep holding my arm up all day with twelve giant bangle bracelets on it?" If you find yourself uncertain, take off a bracelet or two, and always leave room in your bag in case you want to remove some more later on.
 Similar to big necklaces, big bracelets can look gimmicky if they aren't made from the right stuff, so watch out. A high-quality bracelet can be hard to find, but if you look in the jewelry sections of Macy's or JC Penney or even Target, you're bound to stumble upon something that appeals to you.
