 Nobody wants to be around someone who is always looking disgusting. Make sure you shower every day, brush your teeth, comb your hair, and wash your face daily.;
, To do this, just simply get an alarm and set it for about an hour and a half before you have to be at school.
 Try to make new friends, even if you already have a lot of friends. This way, you will always have someone in all your classes to talk to.
 This way, you don't get in trouble, you don't have to worry about getting your homework done in class before its due, and you don't get points taken off for being late.


Put your cell phone in another room, don't turn on the T.V., and save the IMing for after your homework is done. If you do all of your homework when you get home, you won't have to worry about trying to get it done after dinner or whatever.
 Pack your backpack, take a shower, and pack your lunch before school starts so you have more time to sleep in in the morning.
 Just be yourself. Wear the clothes that you like, not the exact same clothes that the "popular" girl wore yesterday. You can base what you buy on some of the looks that they wear, just don't copy them.
 Try to be in some sort of music class, AVID, sport, foreign language, and outside of school clubs.
 That way if you get a really bad grade, it won't mean that you'll be failing the class if you would have been if you had a C in that class. Always turn in your work on time so that if you accidentally left your homework at home, your teacher might go easier on you.
