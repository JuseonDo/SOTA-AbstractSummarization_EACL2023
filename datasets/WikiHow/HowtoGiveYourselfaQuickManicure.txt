 Nail polishes and nail polish removers contain many chemicals that give out nasty odours, as well as toxins/vapors that are dangerous to breathe in. Once you find your area, spread some newspapers or old magazines just in case of spills.;
, This is done to soften the nails and cuticles. Feel free to add any salts, oils or lemon juice to whiten your nails.
 It is done to remove any ridges and make your nails shinier. Buffing shouldn't be done more than once a week, because it can make your nails become thin and damaged.
 (e.g. Almond oil, olive oil, etc). Grab an orange stick or cuticle pusher to push them done slightly. At this point, you can clip off any hangnails. NEVER cut your cuticles!

, Crystal files are best and it is important to file in one direction only. Sawing your nails down will make them susceptible to breaks, chips and peeling.
 Wipe your nails off to remove any oils, lotions,etc, that could prevent the polish from sticking.
 This is vital to prevent the color from staining your nails and protects them.
 Push the brush down the middle of your nail, stroke it up, and then start from the bottom going diagonal. Refrain from painting over your cuticles. If you do, it can simply be taken off with nail polish remover.
 This will add a beautiful to your manicure, prevent chipping, and make it last longer! Ta-da!
