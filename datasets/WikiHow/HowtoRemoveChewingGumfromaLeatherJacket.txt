 Use an ice cube to harden the chewing gum. Hold it until it feels hard enough to start removing without strands of gum floating around. You may need to hold the ice cube with a paper towel to avoid freezing your fingers.;
, Naturally, do this carefully to avoid cutting the leather. Butter knives work well because they are not sharp.
, Let it sink in for a minute.
 Pull the tape back and lift up the chewing gum. Repeat this with a new piece of tape as many times as necessary to pick up the last pieces of the chewing gum.
, The jacket should be in top shape again.
