 Two or three ply toilet paper is best, as it is stronger.;
,, You can either fold these and keep them in your purse or a box, or simply tuck them in a pocket and pull out as needed. If using in the home, leave on a plate, tray or other object for ease of carrying around.
 Naturally, these can also be flushed down the toilet, making it a good way to get rid of them if you are using them during a cold or virus.
