 Many of your friends may have moved or passed away, and assisted living facilities can offer you group activities and social interaction.;
, Are you scared that you might fall and not have one to help you? Do you have difficulty getting in and out of the tub or onto the toilet? Are you afraid at night that a stranger may come to the door? Any of these concerns can be addressed by choosing to live in an assisted living facility.
, Memory loss can mean forgotten medication, stovetop left on, or becoming disoriented when you are out of the home. All of these can be dangerous, but if you lived in an assisted living facility, you would have care and needed supervision.
 You may choose an independent retirement community at the start, but you can move over to an assisted living facility or nursing home if you have any health complications.
 Many facilities can give you a ride to and from public locations as needed as part of your payment rate.
 If you can no longer mow or maintain the yard, if cleaning or housework is hard or painful for you to accomplish, or if shopping is difficult for you to do, these all may be signs that you are ready for assisted living.
 Have you fallen victim to a scam? Are you having a hard time balancing your checkbook?

, Living by yourself can lead to skipping meals because you do not want to cook for just one person and/or not feeling like bathing, showering, shaving or other general hygiene tasks.
