 Abandoned children's foam puzzle pieces work very well for this project, as do cheap "flip-flop" or "Zori" type shoes.




Draw your pattern. Your caddy should be approximately 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide by 3 inches (7.5 cm) long, so start with an appropriately sized piece of paper and fold it in quarters., The ends need to be wider than the middle, and it should be no longer than 4 inches (10 cm), but other than that, your imagination is the only limiting factor.,, Place another piece of foam under your cutting to protect the table surface., Widen the inside end of the slit to make a better holder.,,,
