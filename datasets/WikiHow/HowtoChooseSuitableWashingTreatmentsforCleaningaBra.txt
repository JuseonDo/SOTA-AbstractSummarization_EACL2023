 If needed, pre-treat the bra for stain removal with some sort of spray-on pretreatment. Zout and OXYclean are good options.;
,, If washing silk or silk-like material, use gentle lingerie wash (like Woolite or the washes that GapBody and sometimes Victoria's Secret sell) or shampoo to avoid damaging the material. If your bra is made of cotton,your regular detergent should be fine.
 If you use bleach, wear rubber gloves while washing to avoid harming your skin.
 Let the bra soak for 10-15 minutes in the wash water, occasionally agitating the water and scrubbing with your fingers the areas that have the most wear (the underarms, back clasp, the straps.)

, You may also soak the bra in clean water to ensure that you get all the soap out.
 Unless your bra is unlined, this can legitimately damage your bra. In order to dry your bra properly, lay it flat on the end of a dry towel.
,,, If you lay flat on a table in front of a fan, the bra will dry more quickly.
