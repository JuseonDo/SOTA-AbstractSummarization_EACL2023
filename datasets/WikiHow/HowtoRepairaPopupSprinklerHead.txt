 (Be cautious not to dig too deep so as not to puncture the water line.) Please note that if you have a 6 inch (15.2 cm) pop-up or greater, there is a good chance that the piping has been run to the side inlet of your head (only a few inches underground). Pay special attention to avoid slicing the tubing to this side inlet.;
,, Set the dirt in a pile nearby; you'll need it later to refill the hole. Dig down carefully until you reach the water-supply pipe (about 6-8 inches below the grass).
 Be careful not to let too much dirt fall into the opening of the riser (plug it with a small piece of cloth). The riser may become unscrewed from the supply pipe while remaining attached to the sprinkler. Simply unscrew it from the sprinkler being careful not to damage the threads at either end. It is sometimes helpful to shove a sharp hunting knife into the end of the riser, and twist to remove the riser from the sprinkler. The edges of the knife dig just slightly into the riser, allowing you enough contact to twist and remove the riser.
 The foolproof way is to buy exactly the same brand and model as the old. If not, be sure that the new one matches the old in 2 ways: (1) same diameter female opening at the bottom, and (2) same overall length. Different brands are different lengths, and if you get one that is too long, it will stick out of the grass after you install it. Another consideration: if possible, buy a sprinkler body that has an orange flush-plug top instead of a nozzle, which will make it easy to flush dirt from the line after installation.
 Screw in the new sprinkler body until it is hand-tight.

Before re-filling the hole, run the sprinkler and check for leaks around the riser. Tighten the sprinkler as necessary (or add more Teflon tape) to eliminate the leak.
,, You may need to twist the nozzle slightly to adjust the pattern
