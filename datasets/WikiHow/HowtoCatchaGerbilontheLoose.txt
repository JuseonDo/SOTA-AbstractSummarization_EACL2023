 It may be hiding under something like a bed, so lay down and have a look. If not, carry on to the next room.;
, Check the stairs. Gerbils may be found upstairs, as they can jump very high to climb the stairs, but then are too scared to run downstairs. This means that you can search there for them.
 Try to keep the gerbil away from glass and electricity, or you could have problems on your hands.


If a gerbil spots glass, it will be curious and may push it off a ledge by accident.
If a gerbil spots electric wires, stop it immediately. Gerbils can chew through wires with ease, which will kill them right away, and they may even start an electrical fire.
 Leave someone in there to keep watch if you can, while you fetch your tools for gerbil catching.
 Make sure that it has nowhere to run past you or hide.
 It may likely climb onto your hand. Then cup your hands gently around its stomach.
 Then, poke two holes in the top of the box with a knife or sharp object and put the box near your gerbil. He will find it fun and may jump in, prompting you to quickly put the lid on.
 Then, when you spot them, cup your hands around their stomach and put them in their cage.
, If you use wood or mesh doors, note that gerbils can chew through these kinds of doors. The common barred doors are perfect for gerbils.
 If they are bored, then they will try to escape and find some fun things to do.
 Check every time you interact with your gerbils.
