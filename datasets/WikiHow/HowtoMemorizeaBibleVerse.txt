 Get comfortable. Prop up some pillows if you'd like. Ideally, there shouldn't be any potential distractions. Turn your music off and don't answer the phone. You need concentration.;
, Prayer is so powerful, but you will never know just how much God works in your life until you come to Him every day with what's concerning you.
 Say it out loud with the reference (e.g., John 3:16) once at the beginning of the verse, once at the end. This way, the numbers you'll memorize the reference faster.
 Vary the speeds of your recitation. Focus on pronouncing each word clearly.
 If you are memorizing John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son and that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life", the key words would be "God", "loved", "world", "Son", "whoever", "believes", "perish", "eternal", and "life". Now put them back together with the whole verse.
 Using dry-erase markers, write the verse on a dry-erase board. Make sure you can read what you wrote. Read the verse a few times, then erase 2 words at a time. Keep saying the verse until all the words are erased. If you were able to say the verse perfectly with no words on the board, give yourself a pat on the back.
 Recite verses in your head while you're at the supermarket. Say them out loud as you walk your dog. When you think you have it down, recite the verse(s) for your family and friends!

, Post these around your room in places you go most (your bed, above your light switch, your bathroom mirror, etc.)
