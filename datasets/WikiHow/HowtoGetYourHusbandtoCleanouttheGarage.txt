 A good point to bring up is that vermin might settle into the mess, or that they've already settled. They could pose danger to your family by bringing in diseases, or in the case of poisonous vermin, might bite them.;
,, Large garages full of accumulated clutter can be serious work to clean thoroughly, and may be a daunting task to take on. Plus, some of the clutter in there might belong to more than one person, and it would be unfair to have him clean up everyone's things alone.
 For instance, if he has lost some tools or fishing gear, it may well be an incentive to clean the garage in hopes of locating the lost items.
 It's easier to get to it if you set aside a specific day for doing it, and making sure you do it right away.
 It can be overwhelming to clean a garage in one effort. Perhaps clean the northwest corner one weekend and another section next week.
 However, this might backfire on you and he might throw out something important to you.
 For example, if he cleans out the garage you both can go out to dinner that night-- your treat.
 Your husband might be more willing to do what you ask if you're helping around the house as well. or you could put something of value of his somewhere then say it is in the garage tell him clean it out and you will find it once he finishes go get it and give it to him
