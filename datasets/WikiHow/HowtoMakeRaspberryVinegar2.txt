 Do this gently but enough to bruise them.
 Stir well.
 Stir daily.
 It can be pushed through a jelly bag, a sieve, cheesecloth or other filter.
 For every 300ml/ 1.2 pint of liquid, add 150mg of sugar.
 Simmer just below boiling for 10 to 15 minutes.


Boiling doesn't destroy the taste but it will remove the lovely red raspberry color.
 Store in a cool and dry place for up to 12 months.
 Add to salad dressings, vinaigrette, drinks and marinades.
