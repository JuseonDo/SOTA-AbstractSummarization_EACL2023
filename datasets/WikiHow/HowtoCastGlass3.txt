@summary
mix very small frit or glass powder with an adhesive made for creating glass paste.

@summary
apply a thin layer of paste to the mold using a brush or palette knife.

@summary
add a second layer, tamping it down lightly.

@summary
fire the mold at temperatures between 1,300 and 1,500 degrees fahrenheit (705 to 820 degrees celsius).
@article
 The paste is sometimes called "pate de verre." Be sure to wear a dust mask or respirator to keep from inhaling any of the glass powder.


Use glass paste when you want to precisely place different colors inside the mold.
 Allow it to air dry, dry it with a blow dryer or briefly fire it.
 The combined thickness of the 2 layers should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). Repeat this process until all the areas of the mold are filled.
 Turn off the kiln and remove the mold when it is at room temperature.
