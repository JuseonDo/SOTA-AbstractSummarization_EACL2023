, Here are some common errors that are made when writing checks:


You write the date using last year, instead of the current one.
You write the amount of the check in the “Pay to the order of” line.
You write a different amount in the decimal box than you do the dollar line.
 For example, if the date is wrong, you can cross out the last two letters and write the current year at the end to show the date is corrected. If your mistake takes up a whole line or features a difference in the amount, move on to the next method and void the check.


When in doubt, void the check and write a new one.
, Use all three initials (first, middle and last) to indicate that you have approved the change., Make sure there are no other errors before you sign it and hand it over. Complete the entry in your check register.
