 You will be crimping the zipper so that you create a zigzag pattern and the pins will hold the design in place.
 Pin into place.
 Continue with the same pattern of folding the zipper fabric and pinning into place until you get to the end of the zipper.
 The zipper should resemble ribbon candy. In order to join it together, you will need to sew all the folds together (essentially where the pins are currently located).
