 For the juiciest ribs, you want a slow, even cooking temperature for the first few hours, which cooks the meat slowly while retaining moisture. While accomplished cooks can master this art with a smoker or large grill, it is far easier to use your oven.


These ribs can either be finished in the oven or on a grill, meaning you can still get delicious smokey flavor after tenderizing the meat in the oven

, You want enough foil that the ribs are wrapped up, but there is still room for some steam in the foil above them. Don't completely close the ribs up just yet.
 These cooking acids have two jobs. First, they provide liquid for the steam, which helps keep the meat moist as it cooks. Second, they help tenderize the meat faster than cooking alone, breaking down tough tissue for truly fall off the bone ribs., Resist the urge to open the oven, and especially the foil, while the ribs cook. You want to retain a consistent heat, and as much steam as possible, for tender ribs.
 After the first two hours is up, get ready for some juggling. Be careful of steam when you first open the foil, as it will be hot. Save the juices from the pouch and toss the foil away.


Don't turn the oven off just yet!

, If they're still a little tough, put the ribs meat-side up on the baking sheet and return to the oven until they are easily pierced, checking every 15 minutes. If they are already tender, crank up the oven.If you'd like to finish the ribs on the grill, go set the burners to high and then click here for the rest of the recipe. They can also be finished right in the oven.
 The top is where the oven is the hottest, and will nicely finish your ribs. You're looking for a rich, carmelized sauce on the our side., Once the meat is tender and cooked, cover the ribs thoroughly with this sauce and spice mixture.
 Make sure the meaty side of the ribs faces upwards. This final stage will crisp up the edges, brown the meat, and bring out an incredible final flavor.
