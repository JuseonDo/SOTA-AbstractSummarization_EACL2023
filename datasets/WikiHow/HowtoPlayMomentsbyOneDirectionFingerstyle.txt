 Then A (5), D (4), G (3), B (2), E (1);
,,,,, Then pluck in this order: 4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 3. You will do that 4 times.
 We'll call this the G chord (not really G chord). You will have the same picking pattern as the C chord, but you will substitute 6 for 5. Repeat 4 times.
 You will pluck the same way you do for the C chord. Then lift and place your index finger to create hammer-on sound on the double pluck. Now put your finger back. Then play the hammer-on again.
 Play the same plucking pattern that you do for the G chord. On the second time doing this step, lift your middle finger. The third time do the hammer-on again. The fourth time, place your middle finger back where it was originally.
, Step A) Play the plucking pattern for Am once, then the G chord, then C, then Fmaj7. Step B) Then Am, then G, then Fmaj7, then pluck 6 and 2 on the Fmaj7 chord once.
 You will do the same pattern that you did for the first two verses.
 Continue the pattern for these verses.
, Just like the verses.
 It's the bridge. Play it like the pre-chorus except play Step A three times and then you play Step B.
,, Keep practicing and you'll be playing it like a pro!
