If you want to make it realistic, for a cutie mark, don't choose a bright neon pink.
If you like the idea of a bright colors on your pony, choose neon colors.
Don't choose the same color as your pony, otherwise it will blend in.
Don't choose a completely different color for the cutie mark itself; for example, if it's a flower, don't make the stem baby blue, as it looks out of place. However, if you want to, feel free.
