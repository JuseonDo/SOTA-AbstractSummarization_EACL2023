 'Smart Way' means picking out ONE person with a sniper rifle or Rocket launcher, running away before they knew what hit them, hide again,and repeat.
 The Fun Way is taking two SMG's, Needlers, etc. and just going on a rampage.
 This means get in the biggest vehicle in the match and just shooting every freaking thing you see. Don't stop shooting because the vehicles never run out of ammo and you will be twice as scary.
