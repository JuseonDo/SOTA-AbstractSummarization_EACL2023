 Lord, You have all power to influence my life." -- and how about sublimating negative emotions you feel, i.e.:"I feel You working through me; I will let my praise take form as worthwhile, peaceful actions and 'turn my anger (or rage) to higher purposes'." (Rage may seem counter-Christian, yet there is a reason for harsh emotion that you need to work on and settle proactively.)


Guide your anger: "I praise you during my rage against" "for a constructive, loving purpose and expression. I will not let it become vengeful or hateful".;
,, Try saying:"I will not be afraid to admit my limited understandings of facts and truth". Consider:"I praise you that my learning (and research) is an individual journey that I do not undertake all on my own in the Bible, but with fellow believers and the Holy Spirit to give greater order to my thoughts".
:"You are mighty!", "You are Omnipotent, my Father, my Lord!", "You are all and in all."

,", try saying some praises audibly.



"I thank and glorify You, Oh Father, God, for the gift and beauty of Creation and for creating and conforming my life to your will".
:"The sky and the sea, praise the Lord"; "Let all that is within me bless the Lord."

, Psalms 22:3

, And, Isiah said: "Isn't this the praise that He has chosen : praise the Lord by visiting and sharing your goods and the Good News of the Gospel with the poor--especially widows and orphans."

,,, Your plan for us is bigger than I can realize or even imagine. Praising You and the shelter of your arm gives me confidence."

, Whether it is in your bedroom or your car, or on a walk, God will bless you for glorifying his name.

Artists and bands such as Third Day, Casting Crowns, Sidewalk Prophets, and For King and Country have some great worship music that you may find on YouTube.
