 This is an app that has gray cogs and is on one of your home screens or in a folder named “Utilities.”;
,, It’s in the fifth set of options.



If you are not prompted to do this, then you will need to tap Enable Restrictions to create a passcode. Enter your choice of passcode twice to confirm it, and make sure to remember it to prevent you from having to erase your phone.
 It’s in the fourth set of options and under the heading “Privacy.” This will display a list of apps that have requested access to the microphone.
 It will turn white, and that app will not be able to use the microphone on your iPhone.


This could potentially effect your app from fully functioning, especially in dictation apps.
 This is optional and meant to prevent any changes from being made within an app or your Privacy settings.


This will also prohibit newly downloaded apps from being able to use the microphone unless you change it in your Restrictions settings.
