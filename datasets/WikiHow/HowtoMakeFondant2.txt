,,,,,, Place the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds, then remove the bowl and stir. Repeat this process until the marshmallows are completely melted. It should take about two and a half minutes total.
,, Then add food coloring, if desired. It will be sticky, so add the remaining sugar and continue to knead until you can form a ball.


Re-grease your hands and your work surface with shortening if the fondant is sticking.
If the fondant is tearing easily, it is probably too dry. Add water, a 1/2 tablespoon at a time, and continue to knead.
It should take about eight minutes to get a firm, smooth, elastic ball of fondant that will stretch easily, without tearing.



Place the wrapped fondant in an air-tight container. This way, it will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks.
