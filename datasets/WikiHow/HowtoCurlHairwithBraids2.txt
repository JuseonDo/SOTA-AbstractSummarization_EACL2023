 Allow to dry somewhat; your hair needs to be 60% dry before you use this method.
 Make section one on the left, and one on the right. If you have a side part, you can compensate by taking more hair for the left side to even it out.
 Instead of using 3 strands of hair, only use 2. Take both strands and twist them, each time you do a twist, add a section of hair to each section. So, this is like doing a French braid, except that you're using 2 strands instead of 3.
, When you're all finished, repeat on the other side of your head.
 If you have the non-crease hair ties, they're the best.
 Do not brush your hair at all. Instead, use your fingers to gently untangle your hair.
 That will loosen the curls up. Hairspray so they won't come undone and now you're finished.
