@summary
become more tolerant of "conflict," "inconsistency" or "confrontation", in the classroom.

@summary
be aware that encouraging critical thinking can promote (some) kind of a psychological discomfort in (some) students as conflicting accounts of information and ideas are argued and debated.

@summary
promote and facilitate logical and emotive ideas by both: (1) "analysis" involving dis-assembling/digesting concepts into constituent parts (recording data and statistics) and (2) "synthesis" which involves assembling concepts from information and data that may have been found by analysis.

@summary
help students develop skills for resolving such dissonance.

@summary
allow conflicts and confrontational thinking.

 By raising issues that create dissonance, you teach children how to deal with disharmony and to value having their ideas stretched in new directions. Refrain from expressing your own bias so that students have the space to debate and resolve problems without being directed by any preconceived notions.
 Such discomfort may motivate them to resolve their opposing views on issues.Engage student-critical-thinking, those students must encounter the dissonance of conflicting ideas. Dissonance discussed by Festinger (1957) promotes a psychological discomfort which occurs in the presence of an inconsistency. Inconsistency when found in opposition can motivate students to solve, stir, and resolve issues.
 Synthesis is of the higher order of thinking compared to analysis because synthesis is creative: as in writing, designing, forming or inventing a process, system or story. Analysis is similar to detailing the elemental framework of existing concepts as in opening, displaying, explaining parts of ideas.
 Frager (1984) models conducting critical thinking classes and provides samples of popular issues that promote it, for example: "banning smoking in public places", the "bias infused in some sports stories", and "historical incidents written from American (individualized) and Russian (socialized) in opposing perspectives".
 If you find this to be useful from an instructional point of view and you're prepared to develop materials for promoting engaged thinking, and if you practice (repeatedly) using exciting, topical critical procedures, then using critical thinking activities in the classroom can produce positive, involved, and enthralling results.
