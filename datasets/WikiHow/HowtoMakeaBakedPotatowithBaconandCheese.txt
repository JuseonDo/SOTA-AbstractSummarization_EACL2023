 Prick a couple of holes in it with a fork. If using an oven, place the potato on a baking tray and oven bake it at on a medium heat. If using a microwave, put it on a plate, but wait for a bit until you put it in.;
, When bacon is cooked allow bacon oil to be absorbed by placing bacon on a paper towel on a plate. Rip or cut the bacon strips into small pieces. At this point anyone using a microwave should put in the potato now at a high heat for about 10 minutes.
, Mix the spooned out potato with the bacon and grated cheese then place back into the skin and place the potato back into the oven/microwave for a few more minutes at a low heat. Allow the cheese to melt and the bacon to re-warm.
