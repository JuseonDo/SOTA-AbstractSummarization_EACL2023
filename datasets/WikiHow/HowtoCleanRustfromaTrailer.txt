 You can find the sponge and cleaner at a recreational vehicle dealer shop. Pour the cleaner in a bucket of water. Mix it together and scrub it well onto the rusted area of the trailer.
 Rinse the rusted area with a hose (make sure it’s not a pressure hose) after scrubbing well., This microfiber cloth cleans without damaging the surface of the trailer, hence gives you a clean trailer., Get rid of rust, dents and scratches by rubbing sandpaper on the affected area. Rub the sandpaper till the metal surface loses its shine. Clear the dust from the sandpaper once you’re done with scrubbing., Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when applying the aluminum primer. Usually, once you apply the primer, it takes 2- 5 hours to set well in place., The paint will bring back the original shine of the trailer.
