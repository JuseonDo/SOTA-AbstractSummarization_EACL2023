@summary
determine the proportion of metals (elements other than hydrogen and helium) in a star.

@summary
keep your eyes open for stars with no metals.
@article
 Stars with greater than 1% metals are termed metal-rich, and are part of something called Population I. Stars with about 0.1% metals are termed metal-poor, and are part of Population II. Population II stars formed earlier in the universe, when less metals had been formed.
 These stars (Population III) are expected to have been born just after the Big Bang, when the only elements were hydrogen and helium, and metals did not exist. As of yet, these stars are only theoretical, but people are looking very hard for them.
