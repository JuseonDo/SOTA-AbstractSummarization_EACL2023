 If you are really good with your hands or want to experiment you could do it yourselfÂ ! There is no need to purchase anything new.Ideally you need a facial cleanser, facial scrub such as apricot face scrub,moisturizer and steamer.Use your/your friend's usual products. They are still cheap to purchase in the usual high street toiletries/chemist shops and even the supermarket these days.;
, A warm face towel will do if you haven't got a steamer but a facial scrub is crucial.Use the moisturizer in place of the cleanser if you haven't got a cleanser and repeat at the end. You also need to pat it dry.
 by applying the cleanser on the face skin and rub with your hands (washed and dried). Rub the cleanser in circular movements from the chin upwards. If possible your friend should be lying on a bed and you standing at the head of the bed looking down at her face or she/he can sit on an armchair allowing him/her to lean back.
 You could massage the feet during this time.After 15 minutes the skin pores will be open to release any material blocking them(see Acne1 post). Apply the facial scrub and repeat the procedure described for cleansing.Massage the face in circular movements for 5 minutes and wipe off with a clean moist face towel twice.
, With experience you can perform one on yourself.Enjoy
