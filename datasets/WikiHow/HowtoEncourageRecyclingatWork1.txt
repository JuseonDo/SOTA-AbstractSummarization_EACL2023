The more your co-workers know about the advantages of recycling at work, the more likely they are to participate in a workplace recycling program. Informing them of the consequences of not recycling may also help to discourage them from disposing of recyclables improperly.;
, Keep the information current and replace it every few weeks with new materials.


Making the information easily accessible to employees will increase the chances they will take the time to become informed. If you do the leg work, they will likely take the time to explore the resources you provide.



Weigh the amount of trash you have recycled and post the number of pounds your office is recycling every week. Being able to quantify their efforts will help employees put their contributions into perspective.
