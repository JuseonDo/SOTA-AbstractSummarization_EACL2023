,, Loop the lace piece around. Sew or glue together where it joins.
 Join in the same place and same way as the lace loop.
 This forms the distinctive bow shape. Sew or glue the pinched part in place.
 This covers up the unfinished look and provides a surface for attaching the flower applique to. Glue or sew the piece of ribbon at the back to secure it, where it joins in a loop. Leave a space behind the loop to make room for the clip or elastic you'll be adding shortly.
, If adding an elastic, do a loop knot to keep it in place, or glue in place. For the clip, glue in place.
 One very simple yet pretty flower ribbon hair bow.
