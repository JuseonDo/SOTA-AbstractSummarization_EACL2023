 There are many lists available of plants that are native to your area that are attractive to birds, bees, and butterflies. Talk to the people at your local nursery, they may (or may not) know something about this. Once you have a good knowledge of natives, it's not a good idea to add some non-natives just for fun, because they can destroy native plants and they won't attract your local wildlife.;
, Again, many lists of plants are available in books and online.
 See if you can find an organic nursery to get your plants from. Plant organically, using no pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.
 (Try to get a tree that already started growing and plant it.
 If you want to make it fancy, create a pattern. For example, put trees in the middle, plant bushes around them in a circle and leave room for walking through.
 Birds love wildflowers, and they love a meadow or prairie. They use parts of the tall grasses in their nests.
 Check which are native to your area.
 Birds and many other animals rely on the berries. Plant blueberries or blackberries or raspberries, for example.
, Change the water every week to prevent disease.
 They love sunflower seeds.
 Remember skunks, squirrels, etc. will be coming around more often. (When installing a pond with fish in it you need an underwater heater.
 Buy goldfish. They grow to be incredible sizes! Put real plants in the water, and use a filter. Read up on how to care for your garden pond.
