This option may appeal to first-time builders in particular, as all the parts are designed and built to fit together; the manufacturer can address problems or warranty issues.

Have a well-lit, uncluttered space you can dedicate solely to the project. You will be building in stages, leaving you with a partially assembled chopper in this space for a long period of time.






This option may cost the most up front, as you will be purchasing most or all the components of a new motorcycle at the same time.
