@summary
approach a girl that you want to dance with, and just say “do you want to dance?” if she says yes, proceed to the next step.

@summary
put your arms around your partner’s waist.

@summary
at this point, she’ll probably put her arms around your neck and move closer.

@summary
sway side and side to the beat, taking small steps to the left and right.
@article
 If she says no, just ask another girl.
 Gently rest your hands against her sides, or on the small of her back.


Don’t grab her butt. In fact, general butt-touching should be avoided.
 Pull her in so that your bodies are touching, but not squished together. She should be able to rest her head on your shoulder or chest, but still be able to move somewhat. Remember: firm, not squished.
 This is all you need to do in terms of movement. Make sure you move exactly to the beat, or you may become off sync with her.
