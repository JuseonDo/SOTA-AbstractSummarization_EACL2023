 This does not have to be urban and it does not have to be illegal or abandoned, either. You could start just outside your door or in the city centre, behind an empty house or in a residential area with blocks of flats. As urban areas are mostly the most complex, they are the most interesting, though.;
, Nothing's worse than having to go home early because your feet hurt., Use a backpack, not a handbag. Take some food and drinks. Also take things you might need like a torch/lighter or money. (You might feel extra hungry or discover a nice shop.) Don't forget enough warm clothes if it is cold and sun lotion if the sun is shining.
 Try to go places you wouldn't normally go. Try doors to see if they're open. Go behind things, inside, on top or underneath.

Leave nothing but footprints.
Break nothing but silence.
