 Both players need to understand this way of writing your moves in Chess. It can be learned within a few minutes. Ideally, learn the full algebraic notation for the ease of understanding it provides., If you don't have one, then create it. Both players will need an email address to play this way.
, If you're using Just Chess, it'll be called 'Just CHESS.exe'.
, Then, have them save the board in the folder of their choice, and write their move in algebraic notation and email their opponent.
 If it is not the starting move, then the player must first load the board which he\she saved earlier and then make a move.
 They must also make that same move on their board and save the board.


It may help to number each version of the board sequentially, or to include the date and time in the file name, to avoid losing track of what's been done in the past.
 If you're in doubt about the boards being the same at any given point, you can send your most recent game board file to your opponent to make sure they match up.
