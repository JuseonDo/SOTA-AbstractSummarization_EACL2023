 You can use the mustard stage in the recipe above for such an endeavor.
 If you're using fresh herbs, remove the leaves from stems, cut down large leaves, etc. The herbs should not be large when added to the mustard.
 Mix thoroughly.
 Any leftover mustard can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight glass container.
