 Then click “OK” again when Outlook informs you that it will only apply when Outlook is restarted.


At this point, the setup will have been completed.
 Outlook will then inform you if the Connector needs to be upgraded. Having an upgraded connector ensures that you have the most recent features available on the Outlook connector. You can select “Remind me later” if you want to use Outlook right away.


If you choose to upgrade later, Outlook will then remind you at a later time. You can still read, send, and receive e-mails on your Hotmail account through Outlook without upgrading, but you will be missing out on new features if your connector isn’t up-to-date.
If you choose to upgrade, an installation wizard will appear, and it will guide you through the setup process. Click “OK” when Outlook prompts you that it will close to begin the upgrade process.
 This will activate the “Install” button below it.
 Press “Next” on the following screens as these are all default configurations that you shouldn’t worry about.


During the installation, you will see a progress bar; just wait for the installation to finish.
