 It might be gold, silver, or another material that strikes your fashion chord. You will also need jump rings, a clasp, and the tools listed in the "Things You'll Need" section.;
, It should not be excessively loose so you keep from snagging it on something. Cut the chain so that you will be able to easily clasp it around your ankle.
 You need to carefully consider where the assembly is clasped so that will easily wrap around your ankle and shoe. Perhaps having it in front is easiest. 

, If you have some way to secure the anklet, it will help the attachment process proceed more smoothly.
 Two, three, or four are popular choices, but follow your head. You will need two jump rings for every strand of chain.


Since pumps are not all the same there is the possibility that your ankle jewelry will not fit every shoe you had hoped to pair with the anklet. It is best to check measurements if you intend to use this on different shoes and aim to maximize the flexibility of the anklet.
 Each jump ring should be opposite its partner, but not necessarily 180º apart.


If you attach one end of of each loop chain to the main chain will make it easier to measure.



To keep the strands straight, it may be helpful to mark each strand if you did not already attach them.
, Put on your pumps and wrap the chain around your ankle, working the strands around your heel, then engage the clasp.
