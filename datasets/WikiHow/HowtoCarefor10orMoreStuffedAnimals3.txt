put them all in bed.

take some time and go to the library and get a chapter book to read to them every night before bed.

good night.

 So to get your stuffed animals ready to sleep read on!

, If you have a trundle bed pull out your trundle halfway if your parents let you! Then tuck them all in.
 Then repeat when you get to the end of the book. If any of your stuffed animals are still awake, sing them a lullaby.
