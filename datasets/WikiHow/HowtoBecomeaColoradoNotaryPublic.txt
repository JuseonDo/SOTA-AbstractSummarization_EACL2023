 You must be a Colorado resident, be at least 18 years old, be able to read and write English, have no felony convictions in your lifetime and no misdemeanor convictions involving dishonesty in the last five years and your notary commission must have never been revoked in your lifetime (the last requirement doesn't apply to new notaries).;
, There are courses that are offered online and in-person and generally cost around $40. You can easily find these courses by Googling: Colorado Notary Training.
, This can be found at: https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/notary/notaryTesting.html Once you pass the exam, you will get a certificate that indicates that you passed, with a score of 80% or higher. Be sure to save the certificate as a PDF file. The test is open-book and consists of 40 multiple choice questions and should take about 40 minutes. There is no time limit. It can be taken as many times as needed.
 Many banks will perform notarizations for free. Scan the notarized affirmation form to create a PDF file.
 If you have a Colorado driver's license, simply fill in your driver's license number on the notary application form. The SOS will retrieve your record from the DMV.
 Note that there is a $10 filing fee.
, This typically takes 2-5 business days. You will hear back from the SOS by email. Once they have approved your application, you will get access to your notary certificate. It will contain your name, notary ID number, and commission expiration date. Commissions must be renewed every four years.
 Order your notary supplies (notary rubber stamp and notary journal) from a notary supply business and then start serving the public as a Colorado Notary!
