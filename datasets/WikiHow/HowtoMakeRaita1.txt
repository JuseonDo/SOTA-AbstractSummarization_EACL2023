 It should be the consistency of pancake batter. Don't worry if you made it too thin, add more yogurt.;
, You may choose to peel it or not, it is a personal preference. Squeeze as much as the water from the cucumber as you can. Add it to the yogurt mixture. Stir well.
 You can also add a small handful of mint finely chopped or generous pinch of dried mint or dill.
 About 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds will add texture. If you want a stronger flavor, you can slightly dry toast the seeds before you add them.
