Mix to combine into a dough., Knead for 10 to 15 minutes until the texture becomes elastic and the dough feels smooth., Cover with a lightly oiled sheet of cling film. Set aside in a warm place to rise. Leave for an hour or until it doubles in size.,, Tip onto a floured surface. Punch down, then knead for about 1 minute or until it becomes smooth., Then break each quarter into 5 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Do not overlap; allow room for expansion during baking., Spray the tops lightly with a little cooking oil spray. Doing this will create a glossy surface during baking. Cover with a lightly oiled sheet of plastic wrap. Set aside for 20 minutes to half an hour, to allow them to double in size again.

Alternatively, you can brush a little milk over the top of each roll.
 Remove the wrap when the rolls have risen., Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden., The rolls can be served slightly warm or completely cooled. To cool, arrange on a wire cooling rack.
