 You can use either black or orange, or a mixture of both (alternating the pompoms on the wreath).
 Large pompoms will make a large wreath, while small pompoms will make a smaller wreath. This depends on how much yarn you have and your space requirements.
, Use a hot glue gun to stick the pompoms to a vine or other wreath form. Keep close together but don't squash the pompoms up.
 The wreath can be hung as it is or you might choose to add a Halloween decoration such as a witch or black cat cut-out or perhaps a big ribbon bow.
, Hang on the front door or elsewhere.


Suitability for getting wet depends on the yarn make and how soggy it gets. Bear this in mind when hanging outdoors.
