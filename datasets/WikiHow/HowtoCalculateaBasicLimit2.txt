plug in infinity (∞) or negative infinity (-∞) into the equation.

simplify the equation to get a real answer.

if there's a limit where x goes to infinity, an alternate method is to only consider the term with the highest power in both the numerator and the denominator, and ignore all the other terms, then use the simplified version of the limit to work with.

 Remember that any constant over an infinity in the denominator is equal to zero.
 Remember ∞/∞ is not an acceptable answer.


In this certain situation, putting an ∞ in for "x" would result in the answer being ∞/∞, which is not acceptable.
Therefore, the variable "x" was divided out of both the numerator and the denominator, which left the equation above.
It is then OK to plug in the infinity sign into the variable, which would result in 1 + 0 in the numerator, and 3 + 0 in the denominator, giving us a real answer of 1/3.
 Both methods should always yield the same value.
