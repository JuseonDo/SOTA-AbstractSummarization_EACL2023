@summary
place a stick upright in the ground so that you can see its shadow.

@summary
mark the tip of the shadow with a small object, such as a pebble, or a distinct scratch in the ground.

@summary
wait 10-15 minutes.

@summary
mark the new position of the shadow's tip with another small object or scratch.

@summary
draw a straight line in the ground between the two marks.

@summary
stand with the first mark (west) on your left, and the other (east) on your right.

 Alternatively, you can use the shadow of a fixed object. Nearly any object will work, but the taller the object is, the easier it will be to see the movement of its shadow, and the narrower the tip of the object is, the more accurate the reading will be. Make sure the shadow is cast on a level, brush-free spot.;
, Try to make the mark as small as possible so as to pinpoint the shadow's tip, but make sure you can identify the mark later.
 The shadow tip will move mostly from west to east in a curved line.
 It will likely move only a short distance.
 This is an approximate east-west line.
 You are now facing mostly toward true north, regardless of where you are in the world. The illustration shows that the sun and marker at Points 1 is what is happening for Step 2. At Points 2, it shows what is happening for Step 4. This method is based on the fact that the sun moves across the sky from East to West.
