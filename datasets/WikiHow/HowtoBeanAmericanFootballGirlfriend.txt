 It may seem that Football is more important than you, but It's your job to always support him. Mad at him or not, he's out there on the field thinking of you and wanting to do better because you're in the stands watching him.;
, He'll appreciate that you are trying and you care about him.
 If you don't already know the rules about football the Internet will be your best bet! Or, you could just ask your boyfriend for a few pointers. He'll be glad you are interested and are trying.
 That will gain you major girlfriend points! His parents will see how supportive you are just by showing up! Also, you get to spend time with his family.
 It'll show him you are his #1 fan!

, You will be seeing them quite often so get used to being around them a lot. Bring them snacks for after practice if you'd like, it'll show them that you aren't only watching your boyfriend out there. After all,they play football as a TEAM.
 Guys tend to get sensitive towards the game, so be careful when you use constructive criticism. Your guy is already feeling bad because they lost, so just hug him and tell him he'll always be your favorite player.
 It will calm his nerves and show that you care about his stress. He may give you a massage in return!

, Things like that will be sure to get him pumped up and ready for the game. But also understand that if he wants to stop texting you an hour before the game starts, let him. He has to warm up and clear his mind. He has a role in the game and he has to make sure he's one-hundred percent focused.
 It will all be worth it in the end. You'll be able to point out that, That's your guy out there. There's nothing more your boyfriend will love than a very supportive girlfriend. Always have fun with it! He will see it's not just a "job" for you to be there, he'll love that you are having a good time!
