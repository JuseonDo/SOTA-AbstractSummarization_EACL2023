 When someone decides to take their own life and is part of a tight-knit group, it deeply affects the people for whom they were so close to. They can feel as if their circle has been broken.
 This isn't something you should handle alone without suitable help. A school counselor, a therapist or some other person trained to assist with this challenging situation must be called upon for advice.
 You have been impacted too and this will make it harder for you to act in a role of supporting your other friends. It is important, no matter how strong and protective you feel, that you also get help for your feelings and emotional outfall from the event.


It is understandable that you want to help when you care deeply for your remaining friends but don't neglect yourself in the process.
 Make it clear who is available at any time should any friend of the group need to talk, let feelings out or just be around someone. Be there for one another so that the emptiness, despair and black feelings can be dealt with rather than swallowing up an individual.
 Helping all of your friendship group to remain calm is an important approach to helping everyone feel that they can cope.
 Defuse any situation for them that may make them uncomfortable. Allow them to gather among themselves and grieve in their own way, in their own time.
 It is imperative that you remain sensitive, and do not use electronic media such as Facebook to contact or notify anyone without the family's authorization.
