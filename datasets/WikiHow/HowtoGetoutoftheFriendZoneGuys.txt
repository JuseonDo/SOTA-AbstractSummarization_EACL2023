 But it will take time for her to realize if she really likes you. If you get put into the friend zone, it might not be your fault. Maybe she's just not ready for something serious yet. Or, she may have a boyfriend.;
, Ring!. If you ring her more than you text her, it may be good for is your confidence, because she will likely take it as your friend.
 Especially if you want to get into a relationship with her, and get out of the friend zone.
 No matter how much you want to, this will just push you further into the friend zone!

, No matter how much you want to, she will take notice of the ones you do give, and she will more likely to return the compliments to you.
 The nice guy approach is good sometimes, but with some girls the nice guy gets nowhere. All girls are different and the 'bad boy' doesn't always work out all the time, either.
 This is hard if you and her are close friends

, agree in a couple of things, this is good.. if you agree with her all the time, it means that she's winning, not you.
 Be honest about your feelings, see what she thinks, and hopefully someday you two will be in a relationship. Although, don't worry yet, this is a hard task that may take some time!

, Get a plan, and make her yours!

, There are plenty of fish in the sea, have confidence. And most of all enjoy life, don't let her hold you back!
