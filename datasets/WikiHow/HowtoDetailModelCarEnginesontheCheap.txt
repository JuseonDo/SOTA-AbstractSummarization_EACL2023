 Plastic-coated and stiff enough to stay where you put it, Kynar wire comes in three colors, red blue and white. The white is ideal for painting the color of your choice for a variety of applications.;
, Yeah, it sounds girly, but this painted wire comes in a number of gauges for use as valve stems, battery posts and cables, brake lines, etc. On the plus side, floral wire is painted green, even though it sounds like something that should be pink.
 Also available in numerous gauge diameters, this stuff is great for radiator and heater hoses.
 The adhesive on this tape is strong and keeps the "clamps" in place without the use of additional glue. Use the tip of a #11 hobby blade to make the slots on the clamp after it is placed on the hose. Warning! Aluminum tape is sharp and should be handled with care and kept out of reach of children.
 It is indispensable for detailing.
 Simply cut out the stock cast belt and glue the pulleys to the engine and run the tape around the belts. It is best to glue the belt in place out of sight on the bottom of the crank pulley with CA glue (super glue).
