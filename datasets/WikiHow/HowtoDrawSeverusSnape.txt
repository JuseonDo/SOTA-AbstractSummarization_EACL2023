 This forms the guideline for Snape's face.;
, The one shown around his face is for guiding the addition of Snape's hair while the other one will help you to position his nose and other facial features.
 Pencil in a guideline for the mouth position. Finish up this step by drawing the collar and shoulder lines.
 Include the eyebrows.
 Refine the shapes of the eyes, nose and eyebrows drawn in the previous step. In addition, begin shaping the hair, face shape as a whole, earlobe and some facial indentations as shown.
 Follow the guidance of the drawing provided here. Once the permanent outlining is in place, use an eraser to remove all unwanted guidelines.


In this step, start shading the face to bring out features more clearly.
 Unless you're leaving Snape as a black and white outline drawing from the previous step, you might like to add colors. Do this using black crayon or paint and flesh tones. To keep the overall impression of ambiguous darkness, keep his eyes and lips dark. This isn't a drawing that needs much color or the effect will be spoiled.
