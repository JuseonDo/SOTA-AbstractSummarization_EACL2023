 It's fascinating to learn what happened to it during these years. You'll find out, in particular, that in 2006 it changed its name to CodeGear, and in 2008 it became Embarcadero.;
, Since 2001, Borland makes it possibly to legally download three vintage versions of Turbo Pascal for free: 1.0, 3.02 and 5.5. Unfortunately, the most recent version, 7.0, is not among them. But you shouldn't worry. Turbo Pascals 3.02 and 5.5 have one thing that newer versions don't: turtle graphics, like in Logo language. Very useful in some cases!
