To achieve a lighter flavor, use fruit wood and smoke for 3.5 to 4 hours.
For a stronger flavor, use mesquite or hickory and smoke for 3 hours.;
, A modern smokehouse is typically a small structure you can place in your kitchen, pantry, or yard and in which sausages or other types of meat are placed for the duration of the smoking process. Smokehouses are available online or at specialty kitchenware or sporting goods stores (in the hunting or camping supplies area).
, Make sure there's about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) between the sausages to allow the smoke to touch all surfaces. This will result in an even distribution of taste and color.


The kind of sausage you smoke is a matter of personal taste. The most popular types of sausage to smoke are summer sausage, breakfast sausage, fatties and patties.
If you're using homemade sausage, always use a cure to prevent botulism, a harmful bacteria, from developing in the sausages. Mix 2 teaspoons of cure in with every 10 lbs. of meat. You can find cure in the spice section of most grocery stores, at specialized butcher's stores, or online.
When using store-bought sausage, remember to ask for certified meat, as it has already been cured and is safe to smoke.
 A higher temperature will cause the fat inside the sausage to melt and drip out, making the sausage dry and less tasty.
,,, Rapid cooling will prevent the smoked sausage from shriveling and shrinking.


For one sausage or a small batch, simply place them in a bowl of cold water.
For a large batch of sausages, run cold water over them in the sink.
, If you plan to keep it any longer, vacuum pack and freeze the smoked sausage. This will keep it good for up to 9 months.
