the franchise will (most likely) offer you a franchise.
@article
 A consultant will call and prescreen you for financial ability to buy into a franchise system. The minimal qualifications are (generally) at least $50K available cash and $100K net worth. If you do not make the consultants cut-off values, you are not worth their time.;
, The consultant will set up a second appointment to ask more in-depth questions about the types of businesses you would be interested in. Each does this differently, but their goal is to get a financial and personal profile that helps them identify possible franchises for you.
 The consultant will check availability of franchises that fit your profile, and the general cost of entering the franchise. He will provide this information in one to two days in another phone call.
 After the presentation of businesses, the consultant will connect you directly to any franchises that interest you.
 A representative of the franchise will call you to begin the Discovery process. They will ask for very specific financial information and business background to determine if you are qualified for their business.


The franchise will send you a Franchise Disclosure document to review. The franchise CANNOT offer you a franchise until you have had the FDD for at least 10 business days.
,,, You are only committed once you sign the Franchise Agreement.
