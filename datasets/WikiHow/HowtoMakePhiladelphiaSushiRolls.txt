 Let it cool a little and add some rice vinegar for the sushi.;
, The size of the slices is not so important. You can also buy salmon already prepared and cut into slices.
 Spread the sushi rice evenly across it, offsetting the edge slightly.
 The nori should be on top of the rice now.
,, It is important to thoroughly coat the roll in fish and make sure the salmon "hugs" your roll tightly enough; then it will turn out beautifully and will not lose shape when sliced.
 Ensure the blade of the knife is sharp and damp, as you will want a clean cut through the roll each time. Dull knives tend to snag the nori and "break" the roll as you cut it.
