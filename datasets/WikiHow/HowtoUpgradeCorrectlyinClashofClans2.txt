 This is because it is only available for the last town hall level of the game.
 Just like inferno towers, you can build them when you reach Town Hall level 9.
 They are very important because people mostly attack with air troops and air defenses can finish them very easily. They can be built when your town hall is on level 4.
 They are splash defenses which can take down huge group of troops. Same as air defenses, they are available after you reach town hall level 5.
 They are also splash defenses which are very dangerous for troops such as archers, barbarians and goblins. They are built when you reach town hall level 4.
 So they are less important and are asked to upgrade later on.
 They slow down the enemy's troops.[[Image:Upgrade Correctly in Clash of Clans Step 11.jpg|cehfnghdbv
