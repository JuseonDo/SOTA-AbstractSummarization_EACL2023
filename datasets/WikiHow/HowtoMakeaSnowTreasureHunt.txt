The ideas for treasures are endless: snacks, drinks, party favors, rainbow loom bracelets, small toys, mini figurines, etc.;
,, Use your imagination based upon the area that you're in. Use magazine cut-outs or markers to create symbols and lines.
 Sandwich and freezer baggies tend to hold things better than a plastic bag. Hide the bags in the snow as you follow your created map.
 You can set a time limit or continue the game the next day if the weather permits of no rain or snow.
 It can also be fun to have the winner share a bag of candies especially placed in the box and marked "for everyone".
