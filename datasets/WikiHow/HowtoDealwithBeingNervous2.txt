shift focus from self to content.people who are prone to nervousness typically think more about themselves than about whatever it is that theyâ€™re trying to do.nervousness can double when you see the cause of the nerves (an interview, a test) as overly-reflective of you and your potential.

watch yourself.

take your time.rushing through whatever is making you nervous will only be confusing to others, and display how nervous you are.

 If you're interviewing for a job, for example, come in with a friendly word of appreciation for some aspect of the company.
 Try to replace your thoughts about how you're coming off and what others think of you with rehearsals of the real juice of what you're doing. Maybe this is the material that will be on an exam, or lines from the piece of music you will play.
 Facial expressions, gestures, and intonation are all signs of whether or not we are feeling nervous. When you notice these details of how you present yourself, you can create the distance needed to adjust to postures and gestures that show more confidence. By changing these parts of your appearance, you are teaching yourself to "act as if" you're not nervous. When your body changes, your mind naturally follows suit.Some nervous body language that you might want to alter includes fidgeting, slouching, defensive posturing, little to no eye contact, and rubbing your face and neck., If the situation involves the need to speak (and it usually does) remember to speak low and slow. Slowing your speech will allow you to be more clearly understood, and lowering your voice just slightly will decrease the likelihood of a letting out a nervous squeak or vocal crack.
 Most of what we're worried never happen, and those that do are rarely as bad as we anticipate. Try to focus on the grand scheme of things--whether or not any slip-up or fumble will matter, even as soon as next year.


For example, if you are nervous about having to do a presentation in front of an audience, remind yourself that a mispronunciation or having to use your cue cards will hardly be memorable by the end of the presentation. What's more, even if the presentation is a flop, one presentation does not determine your self-worth--it's just one instance.
