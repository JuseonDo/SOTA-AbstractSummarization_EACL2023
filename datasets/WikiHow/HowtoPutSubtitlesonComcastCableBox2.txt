 If you have a Motorola HD box, you'll need to set up the subtitles on your TV, not the cable box. To do so, start by turning the cable box off. Leave the TV on.
 This should bring up the menu that allows you to play with the subtitles.
 It might not be immediately visible, but keep scrolling until it appears.
 Once you do, return to normally broadcast TV to see if your subtitles came through. Check a couple of channels if they don't appear immediately -- not all channels have subtitles.


Turn the TV off and back on, and turn the cable box back on if there are still issues.
