 This person should be the one who executed the best position at the beginning, as this will be the hardest role.
 Bend down so that their shoulders are on the thighs of the other person. Adjust so that is is as comfortable as possible, then continue with the next step.
, Let everyone move around slightly, so there are right angles between each person.


To come down, ease everyone's hips down at the same time, and sit up when everyone's bottom is on the ground.
