 When he is comfortable enough to become curious, he will approach the baby gate to investigate when you walk by with your dog. If both animals seem calm and curious when interacting through the gate, you are ready to try having them in the same room.
 This would be an appropriate time to use the command “leave it.” If your dog begins whining or getting agitated and excited, remove the cat to its room and practice basic obedience with your dog until she calms down.
 Do not attempt letting your dog interact with your cat off-leash until you are absolutely confident that she will not become aggressive or chase the cat. This will undo a huge amount of the progress you have made.
 Continue to keep a close eye on both animals. Be sure to click and reward your dog for any positive behavior.
