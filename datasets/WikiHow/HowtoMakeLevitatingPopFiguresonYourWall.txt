 To flatten out rough edges and bended sides, empty and collapse the box, then put it under a heavy book.;
,, Place the strips on the side of the box you want to connect to the wall. Holding the strips firmly in place for about 15 seconds should suffice to keep them on the box.
 It doesn't need to be big, nor does it need to be clean cut, because it will also be on the side of the box that faces the wall. Just cut it about 1 inch by 1 inch and cut a piece of tape long enough to go over on both sides (as in the photo).
, Place your fingers against the Command strip from the inside, and press firmly for thirty seconds. This is imperative to keep the box on the wall.
 This will help keep the box from collapsing under the weight of the figure, or bending to the sides.
 The adhesive on the strips needs time to cure for a while. Without this, there is a fair chance the box will peel off of the wall. You don't want to be woken up by Chewbacca falling on you in the night.
 Now your figure and its box are levitating on the wall!

, Now, enjoy your display!
