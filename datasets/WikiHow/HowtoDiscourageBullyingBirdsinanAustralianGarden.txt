 This type of open environment tends to encourage the bigger birds.;
, The creation of denser foliage and the reduction of the grassed areas will create a safe haven for the smaller birds.
 Thickets are ideal hiding places and homes for smaller birds.
, If you still want the lawn, expect the large birds there. For the smaller birds, setting aside at least a part of your garden will allow them some small territory where you can watch them live and play. These are the birds you want to encourage:

Wrens






Pardalotes







Finches.
