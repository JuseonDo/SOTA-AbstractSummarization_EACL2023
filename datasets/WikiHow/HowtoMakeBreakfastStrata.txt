 Stratas can be flavored in any number of ways, depending on what ingredients you have on hand.


They can be meatless, or contain sausage, bacon, chicken or ham.
They can also be flavored to resemble different cultural flavors. Try adding salsa for a Mexican-flavored strata, or ginger and leeks for an Asian inspired strata.
If you can’t come up with a flavor combination on your own, think about what you like on your pizza; pizza topping combinations can easily be translated into a breakfast strata recipe.;
, Stratas can be made from any non-sweet bread, provided it has been dried out. Dried breads work better in bread puddings, because they absorb the custard more easily.
 Deeper pans will create a creamier strata, while a more shallow pan will result in a crispier texture.
, The vegetables can be raw or cooked. .
,,, Choose a cheese that complements the rest of the ingredients, like cheddar mixed with ham.
 Beat this well to combine.
, The strata can also be assembled the night before and refrigerated until morning. The longer the strata is left assembled but uncooked, the more the bread will absorb the custard.
 The cooking time will be dictated by how deep a pan you are using; shallower pans cook faster than deeper ones.
