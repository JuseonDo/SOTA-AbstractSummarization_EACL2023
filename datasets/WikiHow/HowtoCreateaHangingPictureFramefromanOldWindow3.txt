 You may want to give the photos the look of “floating” so you may want to size them smaller than the pane or you may want to fill the pane.
 If you plan to add a border, make sure the design not only compliments the picture but also the window frame.
 One way to mount the photos is to spray the edges with spray mount and affix to the glass. Or you can lay the photo down on the glass and use invisible tape to secure it to the glass.
 You most likely do not have a backing to your window so think about if a back support is necessary. If so, use heavy cardboard cut to size. Add sliding hooks to each side of the wood on the window frame and rotate in place after the cardboard has been put in place.
 Remember, this window frame will be extremely heavy so you must use a kit design for industrial hanging. Follow the directions on the kit and consider using up to three hangers to fully secure the frame.
