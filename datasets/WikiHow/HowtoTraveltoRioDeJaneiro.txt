 Taxis are faster, but more expensive.;
, You could spend ten minutes trying different variations of the word "Everest" until you stumble upon "Ever ESS Chi".
 Take a side trip to Petropolis, to enjoy a more colonial flavor.
 There is usually a large variety of food options and the prices are reasonable and charged by the kilo. It is very easy to find an excellent meal in Rio, just look for the crowds. One good bet is the Bar Lagoa near Ipanema's lagoon.
 In general, Brazil is not like Mexico, the Caribbean or other resort destinations. English is not readily used and American tourism is not their largest source of income; Europeans are, and many come from Portugal, and know the language well. Use the weeks prior to the flight to learn 50 phrases and practice!

, Go to the Maracana stadium, visit museums such as the Museum of Modern Art (MAM), Museum of Rio (MAR) or The Rio Bay Museum, which looks like a flying saucer. Visit Jardim Botanico (Botanical Gardens), or sample the wild nightlife in Lapa, etc. in Nitéroi is also worth a visit.
 Remember, Rio as a city is as populous as NYC with just as much variety. If you can't find something to do in Rio then you're not really trying.
 That being said, nice beaches to surf: Arpoador, near Ipanema rocks; Prainha is a bit away from the center. If are looking for serious wave action in a safe beach (not as touristy), try Itacoatiara in the Nitéroi suburb.
 Keep your distance from them and be prepared to run, or kick the knife from their feeble hands. They are looking for the weak and feminine. Use just a cheap Chinese watch and carry a spare wallet with a few bucks, to hand to them, then run! If you are mugged, contact the tourist police (DEAT) immediately; often these kids are caught and your items may be returned.
 Take a wrong exit on the road and you could end up in a favela.
