@summary
to start off, you'll need a team of six to have the best advantage when battling.

@summary
to put your team through a test run, see if you can defeat the gym leaders, elite four, and the champion with your trusty squad.

@summary
if you do need to change something about your team, you don't always have to replace the pokémon.

@summary
however, if you do choose to replace a move, make sure you perform a dummy run to make sure it's effective enough against the trainer you had trouble with.

@summary
once you've tackled the above challenges, it's time to take your game online or against a friend.

@summary
when training up your team, consider using power items like the macho belt, and don't be scared about using the exp.

 Selecting your Pokémon can be tricky, especially since you have a lot to choose from, but the best rule of thumb to use is to select one of each main type (Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Flying and Dragon/Psychic/Steel etc.) This will make sure you have a Pokémon to counter almost any team, and it'll make it hard for your rival to pick a weak spot as you'll have most major bases covered.;
, If you can successfully defeat all of these trainers without any problems, your team is fully prepared for what's to come if you want to battle online or against a friend. However, if you have some difficulty, head back to the drawing board and make any necessary changes to your line up.
 Try replacing a move with another, or making that Pokémon hold an item to boost a stat. Don't be afraid to use the weather to your advantage as well, e.g. Blizzard or Sandstorm, as Pokémon who aren't an Ice or Ground Type will get heavily damaged by those moves above.
 For example, if you struggled with Gardenia, and used a Water Type Pokémon beforehand, by adding an Ice or Flying Type move, you'll be able to easily defeat her as Grass is weak to Ice and Flying.
 This way, you can really iron out any kinks in your team and prepare yourself for the Battle Frontier (if you have Pokémon Emerald, Platinum or HeartGold/SoulSilver). The Battle Frontier is filled with tough battles that will challenge even the most die-hard Pokémon trainers and their teams, so, as the saying goes... practice makes perfect!

, Share to level up lower-levelled Pokémon. However, don't just use Rare Candy, as even though your Pokémon level up, they won't grow as strong as a Pokémon who's been trained up properly, with help from a good friendship between the trainer and itself and with these steps you can make a good team
