 You can either make one according to a box or you can make one from scratch. It can be any flavor, however, chocolate may be the best choice for reindeer.


See How to make cupcakes for a standard recipe.;
, If you don't like chocolate, try using plain white frosting with brown food coloring added to it.
 Do not put the frosting on like a regular cupcake.
 Position them as reindeer antlers.
 Alternatively, you can put a dot of white frosting on the cupcake and a sprinkle on it.
, Dip it in the chocolate frosting and put it on all of the reindeer cupcakes except for one. Of course, one cupcake needs a red nose for Rudolph. So, for his nose just dip a tiny bit of the red candy and stick it on the last cupcake.
 Serve these at a Christmas dinner party with friends or relatives.
