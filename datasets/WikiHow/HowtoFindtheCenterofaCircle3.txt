@summary
draw two straight, intersecting tangent lines onto the circle.

@summary
translate both of the lines to the other side of the circle.

@summary
draw the diagonals of the parallelogram.

@summary
check the accuracy of the center with a compass.

 The lines can be completely random. However, the process will be easier if you make them roughly square or rectangular., You will end up with four tangent lines forming a parallelogram or a rough rectangle.
 The point where these diagonal lines intersect is the circle's center.
 The center should be on target as long as you didn't slip while translating the lines or when drawing the diagonals. Feel free to erase the parallelogram and diagonal lines.
