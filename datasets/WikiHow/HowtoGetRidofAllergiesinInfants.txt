If not possible, a cotton blanket can be placed on the body parts of the handler that will be in touch with the baby. i.e a lap, shoulder, arm or chest.
 They should also consult a doctor before taking any medication because traces of it will run in the lactating milk.
 Use odorless cleansing detergents, preferably natural cleansers where possible. Ventilate often, but make sure the infant is not in a room with a draft.
 You may use natural potpourris for that. i.e citrus peels, vanilla pods or rose petals in simmering water.
 Perfumed detergents may cause nose and lung allergies. Residue of too much detergent will cause skin allergy.
 Clean the baby's bottom with running warm water instead of wet wipes when changing diapers or cleaning baby vomit.
 Use baby oil, calendula oil, or olive oil to moisten the baby skin if the weather is dry. Powder is not necessary but maybe helpful to keep the body dry in humid weather.
, Too much warmth is just as bad as too much cold. A rule of thumb is, if it is cold or hot for you, it is so for the baby too.
 Long colds may turn to allergies affecting the nose and the lungs.
 For instance, fennel or anise tea are good alternatives when handling colic, flatulence, and constipation.
 For example, one may start with soft steamed peas, but keep feeding the same vegetable for two weeks before introducing squash or carrots. Should an allergy show from food, you will be able to find the allergen quicker. After a few vegetables have been introduced, fruits, then cereals may follow. Then mixtures of some of what was introduced earlier may follow.
