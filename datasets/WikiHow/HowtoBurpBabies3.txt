@summary
lay the baby down with their belly over your thigh and their neck and head above their body.

@summary
pat or rub the baby until a burp comes out.

@summary
finish feeding your baby after they burp.
@article
 Remember to support their neck and head with a hand on their chest in order to keep it stabilized.
 Again, this may take several minutes; it may be instantaneous. It all depends on the child. Not every feeding needs to elicit a burp, but if your baby is writhing or uncomfortable, they may need it in order to continue feeding., Your baby may struggle to burp once, or may burp several times in the course of a feeding. It all depends on their individual constitutions.
