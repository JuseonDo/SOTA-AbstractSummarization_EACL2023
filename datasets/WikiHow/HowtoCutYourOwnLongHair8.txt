 There is no need to blowdry your hair as you’ll want it to still be slightly damp for this cut.
 This will catch the pieces of hair as you cut them.
, Cut parallel to the floor, being careful not to move your head. After each small section, run a comb through your hair to ensure that you’re cutting it as evenly as possible.


Always take off less than you'd like, as your hair will be slightly shorter when it’s dry. Remember, you can always take off more hair; go slow and be conservative in your cuts.
 Once you're done, you should have evenly trimmed hair with some long layers in it.
