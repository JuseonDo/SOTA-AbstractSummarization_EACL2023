The Imp Poes
Regular Poes;
,


The Imp Poes can only sustain 2 hits and then their soul is ripped out.
 They take up to eight hits before they are reduced to dust and their souls are given to you.


One sign that a Poe is near is a rattling or clanking sound.
Others are that some people may say something about a strange creature in some part of Hyrule.
