, While you are doing this, apply for a job at New Lines Incorporated to get money.
 then, go up to that light blue guy that is between your house and the bank, click on him, then click "give smokes". He should give you a skateboard in return, and more Charm points, but reduce your Karma. Now, while you are walking, you can press shift to skateboard there, making it faster to go places.
 Another way to gain Charms points is by drinking some beer, which would give you two Charm points. But, wait! There is yet another way: go to the orange dude that is by the bar, click on him, and click on "give 10 dollars". This will also increase your Karma.
,, This will allow you to buy a computer, which will give access to the stock market! The stock market is what allows players to gain hundreds of millions of dollars (but it requires a bit of luck).
 Invest everything you have into it and watch it grow! You can't lose money here because stocks can't go lower than $1!

, If you max out in that, you get around $418 in salary, which gives you a better chance at buying the Cozy Condo, and then the Penthouse.
