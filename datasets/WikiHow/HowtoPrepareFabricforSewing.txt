 Most fabric stores will give you labels with these directions automatically, but if they are not available, make your own.;
, Then wash according to manufacturer's directions.
 Dry in the dryer, and remove the fabric while still slightly damp. Iron the fabric until it is completely dry, using the recommended heat setting for each fabric. Delicate fabrics that cannot go in the dryer should be line dried or laid flat until almost dry and ready to be ironed.
 The interfacing will help stabilize the fabric when when sewing.
 Lay the fabric, right side down, on an ironing board. Place the interfacing, glue side down, on top of the fabric. Slightly dampen a cloth kitchen towel and place on top of the interfacing.
,, Ironing against the grain can distort the fabric.
,,, You can also use a serger for this.



If the fabric has a straight horizontal pattern, simply trim both cut ends of the fabric piece along a horizontal line.
If the fabric is woven, begin at 1 selvage edge and pull a few horizontal threads across the width of the fabric. Trim the fabric along this thread line. If you have not yet removed the selvage edges, make a vertical cut just beyond the selvage edge. Repeat on the other end.
To check that the grain is straight, fold the fabric lengthwise so the selvage edges meet and the top and bottom are straight. If there is any distortion in the fabric, it may need to be pressed with a steam iron, working from the selvage edges to the fold.
