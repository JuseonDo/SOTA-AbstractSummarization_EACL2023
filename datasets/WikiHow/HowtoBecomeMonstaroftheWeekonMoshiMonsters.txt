 This makes you level up fast, and levels are one thing you may be nominated for. Also, if possible, buy a wooden badge from Yukea to put on your wall.;
, Walk to the Main Street and send a friend request to five people there, and then Ooh La Lane and add five people there, then Sludge Street, Bleurgh Beach and so on... You may even get a couple of friend requests from other players!

, Send a message to a couple of best friends daily and then comment on some other friend's pin boards as well. You will draw more attention to yourself and The Moshi Monster Staff will take a note of active messages.
 That way you will get lots of pin board messages.
 Re-read steps two and four to help you with this.
 Remember, gift island is now open to non members too!
