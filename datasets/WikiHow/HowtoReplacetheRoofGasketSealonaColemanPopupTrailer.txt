 Remove the old rubber seal.  Usually you can just pull it right off the roof.  Sometimes you may need to slide a putty knife between the ABS roof and the old seal to coax it off.;
,  Using a clean cloth clean the roof edge with Acetone, so the new glue will stick well., (Available on Amazon.com: just do a search for "Coleman Roof Seal")  As you go along, put a 1/8" bead of adhesive into the groove of the new seal.  One good choice is 3M 3008 Super Weatherstrip Adhesive.
  If needed use a rubber mallet to gently tap the new seal securely onto the roof edge.  Continue all around the trailer until you meet back at your starting point.  Then cut the remaining seal to fit flush against the starting edge of your seal.
