 You'll find these listed below under "Things You'll Need".;
, Removing the raw egg from the eggshell is probably easier than removing a whole boiled egg. The important thing is to have most of the eggshell intact, about three quarters of it as there needs to be plenty of soil for good growth.


Rinse out the eggshells and allow to dry before proceeding.
 Pour some into a large mixing bowl or bucket. Add water to make the soil wet.
 This will keep them snugly in place as you work with them.
 It helps to use a teaspoon to transfer the soil from the bowl to the eggshell.
 It's important to pack them in because you want a very tight bunch of grass growing up, so that it mimics grass growth outdoors.
, Position the egg carton with its precious contents in a warm and sunny spot, such as the windowsill. Water as needed using a spray bottle.
, The eggs can be removed from the carton and placed into egg cups or other holders for display alongside other Easter decorations. Or, if you'd like, simply leave the egg carton filled with Easter grass and turn the whole carton into an Easter grass decoration.
 You can continue growing the grass if wished; simply place the entire eggshell and its contents into the new home. The eggshell will disintegrate and its nutrients will nourish the surrounding soil.
