 The water will help lift the oil to the surface.;
, You don't want any part of the stain to be visible.
 This will give the baking soda enough time to do its work.
 You likely won't use all of the water; you need just enough to dampen the baking soda enough to make a runny paste. Save the rest of the water for rinsing.
 Try to use a plastic bristled brush, like the kind you'd use on a bathtub. Do not use a metal-bristled brush. It can damage the concrete, especially if a bristle gets caught in a crack and rusts.If the stain is very stubborn, add a few drops of dish detergent.
It's a good idea to save this brush for future oil stain removal as it will get grimy.
 Repeat as needed until the stains disappear. Rinse out the brush and put back in storage.
