 You can disable automatic updates from the Chrome app through the Google Play Store.
 The quickest way to get to the Chrome app page is to search for it at the top of the store. You can also open the menu, select "My apps," and then scroll through the list to find Chrome.
 You'll find this at the top of Chrome's app page.
 This will disable automatic updates for the Chrome app. It is still highly recommended that you regularly check for and install any available updates to help keep your browser secure.
