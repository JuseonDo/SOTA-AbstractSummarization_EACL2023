 Since you are going by yourself, you don't have to argue over which movie to see or try to find the best flick to appease multiple tastes in movie. Revel in the fact that you get to be the only decider!;
, No need to share popcorn or candy! Treat yourself to your favorite theater food and think of it as a reward for getting up the courage to see a movie alone!

, If you want to arrive in time to see the trailers or not, this one is totally up to you!

, Since you are there by yourself, you won't be interrupted by friends wanting to talk or ask questions about the plot. Take the opportunity to fully let go and be consumed by the story.
