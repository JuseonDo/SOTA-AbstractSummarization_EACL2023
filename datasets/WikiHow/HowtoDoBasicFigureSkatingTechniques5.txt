Usually, the hockey goal half circle can be used in most ice rinks.
Only if the ice arena allows it, you may be able to draw a half circle on the ice instead.

It is very important not to look down because that can cause you to lose your balance.



Your arms should be parallel to the ice.



Make sure that you push your foot back with enough force to give you speed
Without proper speed, you will not be able to complete the 3-turn across the entire half circle
It is important to keep posture during this to avoid "slipping".



This is essential to make sure that the toe-pick does not get caught on the ice.
 This indicates leaning to the right side of your right blade.


Make sure to continue to keep your arms in place as mentioned above as they will direct movement on the ice.
 Make sure to keep your right knee bent during this.


This should be making the skate slide forward on curve directed towards the right.
 This will make you go backwards.


In order to do this correctly, you must bend right knee slightly.



Normally, it helps to look in the direction of your back arm once turned.
 This indicates leaning on the left side of your right blade. This will keep one on the curved path intended.


This allows flow on ice once all steps are put together. At the end, a half circle shaped like a 3 will show on the ice.
