,, Leave the base intact, as this keeps the potato held together.
 Bring to the boil. Add the potatoes to blanch them. Cook for 4 minutes, then remove. Use a slotted spoon; place on a baking sheet and let cool a little.
, Add the pepper and salt. Melt the mixture, either in the microwave or in a small saucepan.
 Try to ensure that a little dribbles into some of the slices as well.
 Bake for around 2 hours, or until they appear browned on the outside. They should also be crisp, with soft insides.


After an hour, remove from the oven and baste with more melted butter and cheese mixture.
 Baste the remaining butter and cheese mixture over the top. Then return to the oven to cook for 5 more minutes.
 Season with freshly ground pepper and salt to taste, if wished.
