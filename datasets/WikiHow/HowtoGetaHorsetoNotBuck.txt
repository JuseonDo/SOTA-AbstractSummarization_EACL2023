 Start by reading the part below on managing a bucking horse, and also learn from experienced riders or guides.;
, Wear a helmet, sit deep in the saddle, and keep your heels down.
 Even a burr could bring a horse to bucking, so don't take this task lightly.
 Pay special attention to where the saddle and girth will be.
 The horse will usually let you know if it is.
 You do not want to take a chance at being dragged.
 When the horse's neck is turned, the horse doesn't have the balance it needs to buck.
, Make sure you don't end the riding session until the horse behaves and stops trying to buck.
 If you cannot get the horse to stop bucking, have a more experienced rider ride the horse and give you suggestions. This may be the only choice if you are a novice, as your attempts may have taught the horse that he can get away with bucking. An experienced rider will be ready to deal with such shenanigans firmly and swiftly.
 All horses buck for one reason or another.


Check to make sure that your horse does not have a burr under the saddle pad, bug bites, or anything else that could trigger bucking.
 It's possible that he may not be trained properly. Some horses that are not trained properly will find riding tasks confusing and hard. You may be putting too much pressure on him, so he wants the pressure to lessen. And what's a better way to achieve that than to buck?
