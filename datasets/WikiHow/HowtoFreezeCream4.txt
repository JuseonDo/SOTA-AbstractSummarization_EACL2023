 Or, if the food is bubbling away already, add straight to a cooking dish (such as a soup or stew), as if adding fresh cream and let the heat melt it through. Be aware that the cream will be runny and won't whip after freezing.
 As with the previous cream, this frozen cream can't be whipped again; unlike that one though, it should keep its already whipped texture suitable for baking or adding to desserts. Plus, you could try combining it with freshly whipped cream to make a filling go further.
 This can help to reconstitute the cream by mixing the fat solids and water solids back together again.


If can also be shaken inside the sealable bag if that's easier.
 Use exactly as you'd use whipped cream. The dollops should act like whipped cream already divided into small, usable portions.
