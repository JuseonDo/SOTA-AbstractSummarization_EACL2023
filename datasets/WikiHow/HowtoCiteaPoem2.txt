@summary

Place the backslash to indicate where the lines break in the poem. The lines break when a new line is started. For example, you would write: "I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;/I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise" when quoting consecutive lines of the Barrett Browning poem.
 For example, in the Barrett Browning example lines 7 and 8 from the poem are used, so both lines will need to be cited.
 For example, the Barrett Browning citation would say (7-8).
