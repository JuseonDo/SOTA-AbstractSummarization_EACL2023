prune your bottlebrushes when the flower has finished, and before new growth has commenced, cut the top 2/3’s off the flower.

 This will encourage multiple shoots from the remaining 1/3, each of which will produce a flower for next year. Well worth the effort., This is all part of becoming a habitat gardener, more so if you use indigenous plants.
 Some growers it is rumored actually mow them with their lawn mower – effective but a bit extreme., One thing you can do is cut them down level with the ground and forget them. So do not hesitated to resort to this type of “pruning”. Incidentally while this plant has the common name of Swamp lily it is very hardy and will survive and flower well in situations which are dry and receive only dappled light – a great accent pant if grouped in clumps of three or five.
 Over the years I have noticed that many of my smaller growing rainforest plants such as: Acmena species, Syzygium species and Archirhodmyrtus beckleri, etc flower and set seed around the months of December January., During this time of strong growth, I have found it to be the best time to prune (as severely as you like) as they quickly recover and look good again. Thinking about this, it is logical that this happens, as these are the months when Sydney gets it most rainfall and humidity.
