 Using the chair method, it is necessary to have another person to pull out the chairs. It is possible to do this without someone pulling out the chair, but it is extremely difficult, so if this is a first time, it is suggested that you find someone else.
 Find chairs that you can almost do the crab position in, with your hands touching the ground, but not quite. It also helps if all four chairs are identical, but this is not mandatory.
 Take the four chairs and move them so that the backrest is facing outward, away from the centre. If the people attempting this are short, you may want to have the corners of the chairs closer than if they are tall.
 Shift the chairs around so each person can place their shoulders on the next person's thighs. Once you are sure everyone is ready, proceed to the next step.
 You will need to use the same muscles as you use in a crab position. Push up your hips, and it will make it easier for everyone.
, Congratulations, you have completed the human table.
