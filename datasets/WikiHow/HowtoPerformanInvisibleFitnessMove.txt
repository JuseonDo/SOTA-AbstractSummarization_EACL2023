,, It is very important to keep your back (spine) straight. Continue to lean until your shoulders touch the back of the chair.
, Do this using only your abdominal muscles. At no time should your shoulders lead you! Think tummy strength and use the abdominals to pull you back up.
 This exercise should be performed 10 times in a row. Naturally, you can give yourself a few days to build up to 10 in a row. Do this exercise twice a day - mid-morning and mid-afternoon. You should notice the difference in increasing strength within 2 weeks.
