, Power Options in Windows XP allow you to control the power management features of your notebook PC.
,, Use the Fn and F7 or F8 keys to adjust the brightness.
 External hard drives, CD-ROMs, Zip drives, PC cards, and other peripheral devices can draw power from your battery even when they are not in active use. Disconnect them when you have finished using them.
 The faster your computer works, the more quickly it uses up the supply of power. By cutting down on processor speed, you can extend the charge of your battery. Methods to reduce processor speed vary from model to model, and your manual should provide instructions for doing so.
 If your notebook has one, press the Wireless On-Off button so that the light turns off.

Do not leave batteries exposed to high temperatures for extended periods. Prolonged exposure to heat (for example, inside a hot car) will accelerate the deterioration of Li-Ion cells.
Remove the battery if the notebook will be stored (turned off and not plugged into AC power) for more than 2 weeks.
Remove the Pavilion DV2000 battery if the notebook will be plugged into AC power continuously (via a wall adapter or docking station) for more than 2 weeks.



Short discharges and recharges do not fully synchronize the battery's fuel gauge with the battery's state-of-charge. This can result in the amount of power available in one cycle being less than expected or the laptop battery meter being inaccurate.
Under normal usage, batteries should be calibrated a minimum of once every 3 months.
