 Jump in the shower. It sounds ridiculous but the hot water will relax the leather a bit.
 While the leather is relaxed, it will conform to you foot width as it dries.


It may sound squelchy walking around outside (you should be outside or someone will be mad at the water tracks on the carpet) with mushy shoes but it will pay off.
 This conditioning will restore any depleted moisture caused during drying out from being completely wet.
