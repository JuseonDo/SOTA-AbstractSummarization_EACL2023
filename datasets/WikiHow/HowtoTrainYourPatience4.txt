@summary
trace a straight horizontal line on a wall.

@summary
fill a glass of water to a third of an inch (8.46mm) below the rim and hold it toward the bottom with the water line level with the line drawn on the wall as well as your field of vision.

@summary
hold the glass at arm's length from the body until you feel tired.
@article
 Use a ruler if you like.


If you cannot draw on the wall itself, draw your line on a piece of white paper and affix it in place on the wall at eye level.



Try to ensure by sight that the surface of the water does not deviate from the wall's line.
 With practice your stamina will increase and eventually you'll be able to do this without the slightest stirring of the water. Gradually extend the duration. Your patience will grow naturally out of your perseverance with these routines.
