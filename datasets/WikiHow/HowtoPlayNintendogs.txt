 Knock on the door and choose your dog.;
,(Note: Name must be 7 letters or less, try to keep it a simple, easy to understand name, that doesn't sound like a command you'll teach him later)

, (If it's normal, give him a treat (bought later) when he's good)

,,, (Be sure to also have the right type of brush for hair length). (For example a Labrador Retriever with short hair uses the rubber brush).
 (Later reward for correct responses to commands)

, (Tip: Make sure they're bathed/groomed beforehand. Rewarding your pet for commands petting/treats will help)

, (Be sure to tap any droppings to place it in a bag)

,, (Practicing at the obstacle course will help your pet's performance)

, (Try either walking to the empty or dog park, you may have different results depending on your dog and how much he gets along with others.)

, (Tapping the screen, or calling its name will get it's attention faster, and will bring the disk back quicker.)

,, (When your dog has enough energy, walk it to the discount store (the Secondhand Shop) to save money!)

,, (I recommend keeping at least two of everything you collect besides basic care/food stuff, so you can give presents to friends you make in "Bark Mode." feel free to sell extras, so you can eventually afford a nicer place!)

, When you have, it's time for 'free play', where you can do whatever you want. Have fun and boast about your success.
