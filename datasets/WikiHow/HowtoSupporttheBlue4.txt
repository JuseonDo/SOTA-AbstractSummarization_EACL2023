 Keep your hands on your car's steering wheel, until asked to get your license. Move slowly, if police may stop you for a traffic violation, speeding, or unknown reason,.
 Be agreeable, apologize -- apologize sincerely.


Say "Yes sir" or Yes ma'am", matter-of-factly, appropriately, don't be sarcastic.

 They will appreciate it.
