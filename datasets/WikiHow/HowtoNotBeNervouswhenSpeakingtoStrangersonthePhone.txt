@article
 If you are clear about why you need to make this call, it will be easier to focus on the purpose instead of on the fact that it is a stranger on the other end.;
, For example, if you're calling about a job listed in the newspaper, write down your questions ("Is the job still available?" "Where can I apply?" "Should I send my resume?"), as well as information they may ask for such as your full name, address, telephone number, and current employer information.
, Turn off the television, stereo or computer. Try to find a place where someone is not likely to interrupt you. Ask children to watch TV in another room, or play outside.



The person you wish to reach might answer.
Somebody else might answer for them.
An answering machine or voice mail system might pick up.
 Nervousness can make your mouth feel dry, and that can make it harder to talk.
, Don't wait forever, though.
 You are a stranger to them. But odds are, they are a nice person, and are there to help you.
 The sooner you start, the sooner you'll be able to look back on a successful call. That wasn't so hard, was it?
