 Pour 1 tablespoon of water into a small bowl and once it is boiled add the saffron. Leave until dissolved.;
,, Beat to combine well.
 Pour one litre of oil into the wok and heat it up. Add 1 tablespoon of saffron batter at a time and deep fry. Don't overload the pan- 3 to 4 saffron cakes are probably enough at one time.
 Place them on a paper towel laid on a plate to drain the oil.
 Serve.


A scoop of ice cream goes well with the saffron cakes too.
