 Click "General", and then click "Accessibility".;
,, This will allow you to apply the night mode filter on the entire screen.
 The screen may/ may not zoom in and may apply a filter, depending on zoom cache, but this makes no difference to the rest of the steps.


If the menu is zoomed in and you can't see all the options, double tap on the screen with three fingers at once to zoom back out.
 Be sure to tap fast, as slower taps may register as double tap (which zooms in/out) our may not register at all.
 To do this, use the magnification slider at the bottom of the zoom menu to lower zoom to 0% by dragging to the left.


If an option to "Hide Controller" is present, click it, too, to hide the zoom controller.
 Then click anywhere outside the zoom menu to exit.
 To turn the setting off, turn zoom off in the settings, or select "None" from the "Choose Filter" menu/


To set a convenient on/off mode for zoom filter, follow the instructions below.
