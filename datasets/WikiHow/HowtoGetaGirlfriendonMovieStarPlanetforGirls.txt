 One on a higher level, and make sure she's single, too.;

 That will start a conversation.
 If she still doesn't accept after that, then repeat the process with another MSP girl.
 Instead, ask "So, you aren't dating anyone yet?" That'll most likely hint that you're interested in them.
,, Give them autos, love their room, looks, movies, and artbooks, but don't spoil them. Only love what you truly like.
,, If person changes her mind on her own, rather forgive her and start a thing, or rather deny her and start a thing with other one.
