 Look at the things you'll need section of this page.;
, This is because you will dye your hair next, and not stain the shirt when you put it over your head.
, Make sure you can see out of them.
 Apply all over face and neck for best effects.
,,, Girls, wear curly alien antennae. Boys, wear regular antennae. Take a headband antennae (you can buy these at Target around Halloween, or at costume stores for higher quality) and carefully slip it onto the head downwards. You do NOT want it to be smeared when going across your hair.
 You put these on last so you don't have trouble with your boots (grabbing, lacing, etc.) and so make-up and/or hair dye does not get on them while applying.
 It will smear on your gloves and arm-warmers and stain.
 your ready to go!!!
