, Children should never be in a hot tub if the water is warmer than bathwater (about 90 degrees). For adults, maintain the water temperature below 104 degrees. If your hot tub does not have a digital thermometer, consider purchasing a floating thermometer to keep an eye on the temperature.
 The hot water will amplify and speed the effects of any alcohol or drugs. Alcohol makes you drowsy, and falling asleep in hot water can be very dangerous. In addition to the risk of drowning, your body cannot regulate its temperature as well when you are asleep, which can lead to dangerous overheating.
, This will conserve energy and, more importantly, prevent animals and young children from falling/climbing in. It will also help prevent dirt and debris from getting in. Consider using a locking cover to prevent children and unwanted guests from using it when you are not around. Always drain any standing water from the cover.
 This can also help prevent more costly repairs down the road.
 Do not use the hot tub if you suspect any electrical problems.
 If you must have one nearby, use a battery-powered device and place it on a table a safe distance from the water. Be sure all electrical outlets are a safe distance from the hot tub as well, in keeping with local building codes. Corded devices and outlets present a real risk of electrocution if they get wet!
