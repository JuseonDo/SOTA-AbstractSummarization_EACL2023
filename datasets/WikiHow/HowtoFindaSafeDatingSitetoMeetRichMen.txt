 Scammers and crimes are everywhere. You are finding potential match, as well as fighting against them.;
, There are rich men looking for love and marriage as well as rich men who are looking for hookups and arrangements.
 If you are looking for long-term serious relationships, search "rich men looking for marriage".
 Free dating sites care less on customer service and most of them are living on advertisements.
 General dating sites can increase your exposure rate, but cannot make you find real rich men.Â 

, To be serious, verify yourself first. Then contact verified members. If you are interested in someone who claims to be a millionaire but has not verified income, request him to do so. Real millionaire men don't think you are acting rude.
, Do not disclose any of your personal information before you're sure he is a real member and may be your potential match.
