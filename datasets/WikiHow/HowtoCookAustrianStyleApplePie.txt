 Remove the core and cut them into slices of about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) thickness.;
, Add sugar and cinnamon. Let the apple halves rest for about an hour and a half so that they release their juice.
 Heat and stir until it caramelizes.
,, Stretch it really well, rolling it out on a surface covered with enough flour that the dough does not stick.
 Then dust it with flour. Add a first layer of dough. The flour helps prevent it from sticking to the pan or dish.
 Sprinkle them with the caramelized juice and wrap them with the second piece of dough, for the topping.
, Bake for about 30 minutes, or until brownish on top.
 Remove it from the oven using oven mitts.
, Now the pie is ready for serving.
