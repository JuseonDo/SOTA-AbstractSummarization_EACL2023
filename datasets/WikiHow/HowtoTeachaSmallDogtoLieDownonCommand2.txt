@summary
find a sturdy chair or box on which your dog can comfortably stand, and is not afraid of being on.

@summary
steady your dog in front of you on the box, chair, or stairs.

@summary
once he has laid down, give him his reward.
@article
  Practice in a safe location, either on a carpeted floor or outside in the grass to ensure your dog will not be harmed if he decides to hop off. 


If you do not wish to use a chair or box, or your dog is too afraid, the top of the stairs can be a good alternative.  What you need is a ledge that you can pass the treat under, encouraging your dog to lay down as in the General Method.
  Hold the treat in front of his nose and instead of passing it to his chest, bring it down over the edge of the chair/stairs/box.  He should follow it with his nose and hopefully lay down.
 You should follow the remaining steps of the General Method to complete his training in this task.
