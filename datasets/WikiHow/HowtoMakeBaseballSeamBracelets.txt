 Do not cut through the red seam.;

The ball will look like this:







,, Under all of the stringy stuff, it will look something like the picture above. You do not want to inadvertently cut these because you will need to use them for tying off your bracelets.
 Trim the leather as close to the stitching as you feel comfortable. You can trim very close or leave a larger margin. And don’t even worry about, or try to remove the tacky, stringy stuff from the back side of the stitching until after you have trimmed up the leather. It will come off very easily, in one big clump, once you have trimmed along the shape of the outside seam (as you can see in the picture).
, You will have one long, misshapen seam. Do not worry about the shape of the leather, when your bracelets are complete, they will have a natural, circular shape to them. Attempting to stretch and shape will do not a bit of good at this point.
 Cut across the leather again, leaving yourself with two bracelets.#*As you can see, you will have a very natural shape for your bracelets.
 Give yourself enough stitching that you can tie a square knot on the back side of the bracelet to keep the thread from coming undone.
, Run your cording through the existing needle holes, giving your bracelets a soft, tying clasp.


Something that will make the cording easier to thread through the holes in the leather is to cut it at a drastic, pointed angle.
You can use needle nosed pliers or a pencil to help push the end of the cording through the holes on each side.



Repeat on the other end to finish your bracelet.
 Easy-peasy with a great wow factor! ”Play ball!”
