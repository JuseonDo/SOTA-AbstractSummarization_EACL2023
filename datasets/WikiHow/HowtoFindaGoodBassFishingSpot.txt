 Bass tend to hang around certain structures, and rarely move to open water.;
, Baitfish love that structure, and bass love baitfish.
 Standing timber can produce bass, but fishing timber can be a tad tricky, so make sure you have spare lures and time to re-tie.
 The last place they hide is in shallow reeds, near spawning flats.
, These fish love rocky "humps", or areas that are shallow but surrounded by deep open water.
 Mud bottoms are also places these fish will be found, feeding on crawdads.
 These fish, to a lesser extent, also like shallow weed-beds.
 These fish tend to be anywhere near the ocean and do not have specific cases besides the ocean in bays and gulfs. These fish hide in the same places the the fish mentioned above do.
