  Have an empty cloth suitcase all zipped up.   Put your dog's bed on it, or some blankets.  Put a pillow where his head will be.  Get a quilt to cover him up.  Put a few of his favorite snuggly toys on the bed.  Instant doggy bed!
,  Make him popular!, Playing with your dog is a great way to develop a bond and your dog will be happy.
 Many dog food brands have flavoring, find out which flavor your dog prefers and feed them it on a consistent basis.


Buy some luxury treats and spoil your best friend with luscious food.
 They may like this and will become familiar with the leash. Remember to get them a leash that fits snugly.
 This relieves any tension they may have and they may want to play.
 This can include sweaters or other designer clothing made for dogs. Dog beds are also comfortable for dogs and they will enjoy it.
  Fill your clean bathtub with lukewarm water and pour a bit of doggy shampoo in to make bubbles. Put some toys in and let him relax for a bit.  Then scrub his coat nice and clean!  (Don't bathe too often though, once a month should do!  too often bathing can cause major skin irritations... that's no fun!)  Then, after take your furry friend our and dry him off, then brush him.  After, massage him!  They absolutely LOVE that!,  Make sure they know they are loved lots!  Make sure they trust in you fully!  That's what a real bond is built on.
