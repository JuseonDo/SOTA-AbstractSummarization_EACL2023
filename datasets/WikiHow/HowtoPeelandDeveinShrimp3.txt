firmly hold the shrimp and start pushing the tine into the vein cavity.

 Take a headless shrimp and look at the end where the head use to be attached for a little dark dot or vein just below the shell on the top side of the shrimp.
, The shrimp will start straightening out as the tine goes down its spine. The pressure will split the spine and roll the shell back at the same time, peeling the shrimp and deveining it all at once.





This method can be done with a shrimp deveining tool you can buy at seafood markets, but a two tined cooking fork will do the same job.
Running cold water over the shrimp as you're forking it helps the vein come out and moves the process along more quickly.
