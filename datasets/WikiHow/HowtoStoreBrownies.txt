 The storage methods vary depending on whether you're looking to store the brownies short term (1 week) or long term (2 weeks to 3 months).
 Between each layer place wax paper or sheets of parchment/baking paper to keep the layers separated.


Ensure that the lid fits tightly. The brownies should keep well for several days or as advised by the recipe.
 To prepare them for freezing, do the following:

Wrap each individual brownie in food plastic or cling film.






Place the wrapped brownies into a large freezer bag that seals shut.






Place in the freezer. The brownies will now be good to freeze for up to 3 months.






Thaw or microwave individual brownies at room temperature for eating.
