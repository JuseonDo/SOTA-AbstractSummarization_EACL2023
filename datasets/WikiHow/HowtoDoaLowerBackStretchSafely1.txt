 Breathe deeply in preparation for your stretch - this will help oxygenate your muscle tissue, promoting healing and minimising lactic acid formation, which causes soreness.


Find a stretching area where you have privacy and are unlikely to be surprised. Although unlikely, a jerking motion while stretching can hurt your back.;
, Allow your arms to relax. They should drop and hang below you.









Pay attention to the way your lower back feels. It's normal to feel light tension like you might feel in any other stretch. If you encounter any pain while leaning forward, stop immediately and try a different stretch.
 At this point, stop leaning forward and maintain your position.









Be comfortable--do not bend to the point of feeling pain.
Do not bounce to get farther downward.
 You should feel your lower back begin to stretch.


Because you're staring at your feet, it can be tempting to try to touch them. Don't do this - you can hurt your back by stretching it too far.
 Begin to lean backwards slowly.









It may help to maintain your balance if you bend your knees slightly.
 As always, do not bend to the point of feeling pain.
 You should feel a slight stretch in your lower back and/or the front of your hips.
 Repeat these stretches 2-3 more times or as needed.
