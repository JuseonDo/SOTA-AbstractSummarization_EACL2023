Apply sunscreen with at least an SPF 15 if you do need to spend time outdoors, and the area you wish to have hair removed by laser will be exposed to UVA/UVB rays.;
, Shaving is fine, but these other hair removal techniques can reduce the effectiveness of the laser treatment. Also, the hair should not be bleached.
