  It's recommended that you cut them into even cubes so that they all dry in the same period of time.
  Ensure that no moisture is present and the room is constantly at room temperature (15-25°C).  To test if the centipedes are ready, poke the inside of a middle piece with a chopstick to see if it feels stiff.,  This is best accomplished by collecting all your seasoning in a bag, which will be used later. Cayenne pepper and garlic salt are recommended, though chili pepper and other salt substitutes like soy sauce work quite well, as well.
,  Vigorously shake for 1-2 minutes., Then you can store them or serve them right away.  Enjoy!
