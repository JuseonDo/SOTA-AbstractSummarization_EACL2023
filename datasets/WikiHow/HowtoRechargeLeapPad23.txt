 You can also purchase a Leapster or Didj AC adaptor.
 It is best to use one at a low level, near a chair or table. Your child will be able to use the device when it is plugged in to the wall.
 Remove the recharger kit batteries and attach them to the charger kit. Then, allow the batteries to charge all night.
 Batteries will allow the child more flexibility and mobility when using the LeapPad2 than the AC adaptor.
