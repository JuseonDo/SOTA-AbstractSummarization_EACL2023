 Acrylics are easy to maneuver, thick enough to stay where you put them, and they come in a variety of colors to create your fall tree.;
, Alternatively, you can get a thick brush, which has a wider coverage of your canvas overall. It's personal preference.
 This is the best type of material to spread your paint onto, and it will provide a neat texture for your painting. The texture should resemble the feel of crisp dying leaves.
 Start at the top, going down until you have made your tree trunk the desired length.
 Dip your wide brush into it, and then wipe off a small amount of paint onto the side of the paper plate. You don't want too much, or it will ruin the effect of the leaves and the trunk being seen together.
 This will create the effect of the leaves on the (invisible for now) branches of the tree. Pour more paint out onto the plate, mix colors, and repeat the previous step.
 Not too much, but enough to define the frail branches of the fall tree. Spread out the brown paint towards the top of your tree where the leaves are, and create straight-ish lines.
