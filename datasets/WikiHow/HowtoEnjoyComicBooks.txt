@summary
keep an open mind and expect to see many changes between the comic books of years back, and those of today.

@summary
go to the comic shop with a friend.

@summary
realize that it's not all superheroes, spandex and capes out there, and admit that there may be more here than you originally supposed.

@summary
start with identifying other pop culture things you like - comics, like movies and tv shows, now come in all shapes and sizes, and can be compared to a library or stand next to your favorite films, tv and video games.

@summary
do not limit yourself to comics in color - some of the most interesting ones are produced very inexpensively by an independent creator or small company without the vast resources of the major comic companies.

@summary
try out different shops.

 Be surprised at the new graphics and wordings, and artistic design. Comic books as well as all graphic novels have drastically changed, and are no longer just for the young.;
, It is a nice place to visit, have lunch before or after, and make a day of it. Look at the shelves for the latest comics, as well as some of the older ones.
 Ask a staff member to show you the latest comics, or to recommend the best ones, or the older versions as opposed to the latest to compare the changes made.
 Instead of books on the shelf, expect to find an assortment of comic books and graphic novels. See the Tips below for suggestions on matching your areas of interest with specific comics and graphic novels.
 In fact, if you have an idea for a story, you can go to the library, and find a book on How to Make a Comic Book and try to make your own.
 Each comic shop has a culture and feel all its own. If you feel like the shop you chose first is too small, too big, too dusty, too dark, try a different one. If the staff isn't helpful, realize that the culture of a different shop's staff might suit you better. Don't judge all comic shops on one experience, they're all as different as the books they carry.
