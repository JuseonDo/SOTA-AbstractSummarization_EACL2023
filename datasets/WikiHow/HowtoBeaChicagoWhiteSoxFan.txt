 You want to intimidate other team's fans by looking like members of Darth Vader's army and the good guys always wear black. The Cell also looks better when everyone is dressed in black, plus the color makes you look slimmer, and is easy to find to find in stores. Team wear is fine too.;
, You need to understand baseball and know the situation. Sure, enjoy the sun, the beer, the dogs. After all, baseball is about fun. At the same time, pay attention to the game, and be ready to voice your approval or anger.
 As a Charter member of the American League the Sox have a long and often up and down history. They are unique, even controversial. If you are going to defend the clubs reputation, (and you will need to as most fans love to hate the south siders), you need to do so with actual fact. Do not shy away from the colorful history, the White Sox are gritty, real, and the team of the working folks.
 Being a Sox fan is about grilling and bags before the game.
 Its across the street from the Ward HQ, and is the oldest restaurant/bar in the city of Chicago. Its basic, old school, and filled with like minded locals.
 These will usually focus around the ballpark used, the way women look in the stands, or the way the Cubs are cursed by farm animals. Understand that the White Sox are superior to the Cubs in anything related to the actual play of the game.
 You get to bond with other fans.
 This includes home runs balls hit by the opposing team. Respect the field, keep it clean.
