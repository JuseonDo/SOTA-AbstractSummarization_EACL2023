 Is it because you consider yourself non-sexual, but still romantic? Is it because you would like to experience romance through a virtual version of yourself? Is it because you are living in a remote location? Depending on your reasons, you may want to try different sites or methods for jumping in.;
, For example, if you want to embark on a romance in which you get to experience the relationship through a virtual version of yourself (perhaps a version that looks different or has a different history than you), you might want to try a site in which you live through an avatar, such as Second Life. Alternatively, if you want to have an online relationship because you seek romance, but not sex, there are specific sites for that as well., For example, do not go to an online dating site that presents married couples with kids as their success stories. An online-only relationship is not about such monumental real-life outcomes.
 As with shopping malls and dance clubs, there are going to be things you should or should not do of acceptable conduct. On some sites, for example, it might be unacceptable to approach another user with graphic requests. On other sites, this might be part of the culture.
 There are real people behind the words, icons, and avatars with which you are interacting. If, for example, you decide to be exclusively involved with one person in a community, do not cheat by becoming romantically involved with another.
 Some people are just in it for fun. Others might be agoraphobic, ashamed of their appearance, married, or in a completely different place.
 Be safe. Meet in a public place. Tell friends where you will be. Watch and listen for questionable behavior.Be optimistic, but prepared for potential disappointment.
