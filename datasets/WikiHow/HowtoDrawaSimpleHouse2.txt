 Its lines will serve as the walls of the house. These should be approximately even, but don't worry if they're not quite perfect.
 Don’t make them taller than the walls, though, or your finished product will look somewhat unrealistic.
 If you don’t see a house starting to emerge in your drawing, refer to the image here and make it look more like that.
 Remember, we’re drawing in perspective--so for the door and window(s), add in smaller squares and rectangles inside the initial shapes for better detail.
 There shouldn’t be too many, but whatever remains should be easy to get rid of.
 Your house can follow whatever color scheme you'd like; if you're in need of inspiration, step outside for a few minutes and look at houses in your neighborhood.
