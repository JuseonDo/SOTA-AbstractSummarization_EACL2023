 Peel the banana, cut it into thin slices, and put it into a plastic bag. Chop the stems off of the strawberries, then cut them into slices, and put them into a bag as well. Freeze the fruit overnight., From time to time, you may have to pause the blender/food processor, and scrape any unmixed fruit down towards the bottom., If you can't find any heavy cream, or if you can't have dairy, here are some other options for you: almond milk, coconut milk, or cow's milk., Every so often, pause the blender/food processor, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any lumps or clumps down towards the bottom., The longer you freeze it for, the firmer it will become. You can also serve it straight out of the blender or food processor as a soft-serve type of ice cream.
