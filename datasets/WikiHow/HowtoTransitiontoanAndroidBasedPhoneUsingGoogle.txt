 An Android device will function without a Google account. The downside, however, is that it won't function very well, and will not back up in a desirable fashion. There are exceptions, but again, that's not the purpose here.
 I wrote another article about how to back up your mobile phone that gives the basic steps you need to take to set up, as well as where to get the software. Just in case, it's a good idea to have this backed up.
 Many phones - especially smart phones - are well covered here. Read the directions on this page and follow them to the letter. If you are successful, you will shortly see your contacts and calendar on your pages. If you see your contacts and calendar in your Google account (see below for the links), you're pretty much done - but keep reading, because this next step is a Very Good Idea.
 Exactly how to do this varies between synchronization packages; check the software's help file. (tip: search for the word "Export") Export to CSV and/or VCF for Contacts; for calendar, use iCal format if possible.;
, In this last step, contacts (look for the "Import" link on the main Contacts page) and calendar items (look for the "Import" link in the settings for your Calendar) are pretty cut and dry.
 This will hold, at most, 250 contacts.
,, This is where you can control your Google contacts, and if you already have a Gmail account, you will probably see contacts herein.
 This is pretty easy here.
 This is a good way to keep track of what has gone in: if it's not there on the old device, you don't need to enter it.
 Keep doing this until you're done.
