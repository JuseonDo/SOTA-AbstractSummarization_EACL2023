, If you really want to up the ante, use multiple colors.
 To be like the Jeff you see on tv get some Hardy Boyz t-shirts and Ginnie tee's. It is suggested to get 1 blue, 1 black, 3 white, 2 Hardy Boyz t-shirts, 2 tie dye t-s, and one Fox racing shirt.
 Any paisley design in purple or orange preferably.
 As far as Dickies go just get some plain blacks and try to get some without creases. With Tripp, try to get some with not that much chains go for the funky colored stitches. Red and green are great.

 Black and whites work and even checkerboard are good. Maybe a pair of black boots to wear on occasion.
