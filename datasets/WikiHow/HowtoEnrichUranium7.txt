 The laser light needs to be entirely of a specific wavelength (monochromatic). This wavelength will target only 235U atoms, while leaving the 238U atoms untouched.
 Unlike the other uranium enrichment processes, you donâ€™t have to use uranium hexafluoride gas, although most of the laser processes do. You can also use an alloy of uranium and iron as the uranium source, which the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) process does.
 These will be atoms of 235U.
