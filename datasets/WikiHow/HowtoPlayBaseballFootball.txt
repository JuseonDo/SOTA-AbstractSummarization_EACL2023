make teams.

@summary
make a field.

@summary
pick a kicking and receiving team.

@summary
"kick off".

@summary
the offensive team (the team with the ball) gets 4 (or whatever you want) downs (tries) to get to the end-zone, using passing (throwing the ball to receivers) and running (giving or flipping the ball to a runner) plays.

@summary
there should be at least one defender on the quarterback counting "steamboats", or a predetermined number of seconds (counted 'one steamboat, two steamboat...') if the quarterback does not pass or make a play by the count of the last steamboat, defenders may tag the qb for a sack.

@summary
play resumes until 4th down and the offense has not reached the end-zone or if they score with a touchdown (reach the end-zone) or field-goal ("kick" the ball into a certain large space ).

@summary
on 4th down, the team must choose to go for it, punt, or try a field-goal.

@summary
a turnover is when the defense gets the ball.

@summary
on penalties- there are several different levels of intensity for penalties - minor, for small things and accidents, which are usually about 5% back; major, which are for slightly bigger things and a little more dangerous (like tripping), and are usually 10% back; ejections, which are for very dangerous things like fighting, which is out for the game; and suspensions and expulsions, both for repeated ejections and incidents, but the prior is a certain amount of games where you're not allowed to participate, and the latter, out of the league for good.

@summary
play resumes until a predetermined point, whether it's an hour, until the sun goes down, or a certain amount of points, it can be anything.

 You can do this however you like, from boys versus girls, old-school gym style and more. Just try to make the skill level about equal.;
, You can use anything from a real football field to pylons marking the corners. The players should be able to run end-zone to end-zone in about 10 seconds, and sideline to sideline in about 5-7.
 It can be a coin toss, rock paper scissors, or whatever you can think of.
 Back up to your back quarter (halfway between the half of the field and the end-zone) in the centre, pick a thrower, and show a thumbs up to show you and your team are ready. When the other team responds, set your defenders in motion, and throw the ball. The ball must travel at least 10 yards (or 10% of your field) before the kicking team can try to collect it, or it's a minor penalty. The receiving team will collect it, and attempt to run down the field, until they're tagged like in normal baseball. The play stops at the site of tagging.
 Every play starts either with the centre passing the ball to the quarterback or the QB starting with it. The QB says "Hut" and the play begins. If you traverse 10% or more of your field, you get a first down and an imaginary line 10% in front of you for another one. See the rules of football for more rules.
 If they do before, it's a minor penalty.
 A touchdown is worth 6 points and a field-goal attempt from the goal line for an extra point, and a field-goal that isn't after a touchdown is worth 3 points.
 If you go for it, you must get a first down, or the other team gets the ball at the line of scrimmage (where the play starts.) Punting is basically a kickoff from the line of scrimmage, and see about field-goals above.
 Mid-play turnovers are interceptions (a defender catching a pass) and fumbles (an offender drops the ball before being tagged and a defender gets it). Kicking turnovers are kickoffs, punts, and missed field-goals. Turnovers also occur if you fail to get a first down on 4th down.
 Yardage penalties can be reversed (forward instead of backward) if the defense incurs the penalty. Play always stops at the point of infraction.
 The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.
