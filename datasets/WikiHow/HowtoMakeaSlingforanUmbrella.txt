, Do this very carefully––watch closely to check that the tip is slowly melting and stop before you make an unsightly blob.


Mind you don't get a bad burn while the cord tip is hot.
 This hard tip will prevent the sheath and the inner part of the cord from fraying when you make the small loop for the tip of the umbrella.
 This will hold the tip of the umbrella firmly in place.
 Tighten the cord and fold it sharply at the tip of the handle of the umbrella. The length of the free end of the cord should be about a third of the umbrella's length. Cut and melt tip as explained above.
 Push hard to open the passage in the cord-lock and push the double cord firmly through this, so that you get an adjustable loop.


Attach it to the handle of your umbrella.






Make a single knot at the very tip of the free end of the cord to secure everything in place, while adjusting or when pocketing the sling in case of rain.
 You can now tote or hang the umbrella with ease.
