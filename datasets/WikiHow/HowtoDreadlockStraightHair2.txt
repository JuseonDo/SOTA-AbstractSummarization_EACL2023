 Place a rubber band around each part to section the hair off completely before you actually start dreading. Remove the rubber band before you backcomb though.
 This method is similar to "teasing" your hair. Repeat this step as many times as needed to have the section resemble a dreadlock.
 Add some kind of natural product to it if you want. Rubbing fine wood fire ash through your dreads can make a huge difference at the beginning of this process! Just be sure to properly clean out the ash, as leaving it in can be harmful.
 Wash your hair as needed during that time, but don't use any conditioning products.
, This should be done using a metal comb, beginning from about an inch off your scalp and working toward the end. Once you reach the end of the section, repeat this step until a dreadlock is formed.
, This can be done using either a dental floss or small crochet hook.
