 Put the bubble shield somewhere close to the action. Wait inside the shield for people to come in, and right when they do, blast them.;
, Try to hide it from your opponents, or you will be a main target. Find a large group or enemies somewhat close to each other. Shoot the rocket into the group. This is recommended for more skilled players.
 You will attack faster, but you won't lunge.
