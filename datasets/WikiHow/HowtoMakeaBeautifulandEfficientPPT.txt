, Write your outline as one title one page.
 Write out or copy the content that is suitable for the titles and revise the words. Make the content of each page as a point with “Project number”. Of course in the process of searching for information, you will find some useful information which may not be included in your outline. You can adjust this and add new page in suitable position.
 For example, contents including numbers, processes, causal relationships, trends, time, juxtaposition and sequences etc could all be expressed by pictures. If sometimes the content is too much or can’t be expressed by pictures, you could express it with charts. If it couldn’t be expressed by pictures and charts, express it in text. So the best sequence of expression is pictures-charts-words. In this process, don’t care about whether the pictures are beautiful or not, just use the pictures that could accurately express your content.
 If you think that the templates are not quite suitable for your contents, you could adjust it by yourself, such as adding logo, background pictures or decoration pictures and so on. Of course, if there is a standard template of your company, you could use it directly.
, Do remember that the colors of the whole PPT shouldn't be more than three. Otherwise your PPT will appear unusual.
 The principle of using decoration pictures is that they should be related to the title and the size and color.
 If your PPT is very important, you could ask your colleagues to double-check it because sometimes we can’t find our own mistakes.
