 Note that you can purchase the clay in any color you please, but black is the traditional color of runes. It may become a bit dull after baking, so you may as well pick up paint to match.;
, This will be the same size as your Rune, so make sure you're happy with the size before proceeding.
 With a small, sharp knife, cut thin and shallow lines around the picture. Do not cut all the way through just yet. Be as precise as possible and cut close to the picture.
 Get the outer lines, the insides of the curves, and inside the diamond. It won't be perfect at first, so cut away all the loose outer edges. Take note that the back of the rune is supposed to be left flat for stability. Smooth over the Rune once you're done cutting- you can use a little water to seal cracks shut.
 Make sure that the hole is big enough for a chain or string of your choice to fit through. Alternatively, you can purchase a jewelry kit and use the items in it.
, Add extra detail to it if you like, such as paint or a glossy finish (like clear nail polish).
