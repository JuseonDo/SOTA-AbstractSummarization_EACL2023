The Garage in NFSU2 is a place where you can view the map of the game world and tune up your car.


On the Parts Storage menu you will find three options: Change Body Parts, Change Performance Parts, and Change Interiors. “Change Body Parts” allows you to uninstall parts like body kits and roof scoops while “Change Performance Parts” deals with engine modifications. “Change Interiors” allows you to remove such things as car speakers.
