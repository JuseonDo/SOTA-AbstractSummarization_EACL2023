 Take that one cup of raisins in the original recipe and cut it in half. Now figure out what you want to replace it with! The following options will all go nicely with the raisins, but you can just as easily substitute these ingredients for all of the raisins if you wanted to:


Chocolate chips or chunks (white and dark chocolate go particularly well)
Chopped walnuts, pecans, or almonds
Dried cranberries, This thick, rich, and dark syrup matches beautifully with the spiced flavors of a good oatmeal raisin cookie., This fantastic cookie takes all of the joys of a good oatmeal raisin cookie and blasts it with a fresh, spiced, and always delicious burst of sweet Indian spices. Add the following spices and, if you're really feeling culinary, let the raisins steep in a cup of chai tea for 15 minutes as well:


1 teaspoon each of cardamom, cinnamon, ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon each of ground ginger, nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper., Both sweet and savory, the addition of vanilla salt, often sold as "vanilla fleur de sel," will bring out a richness and slight saltiness that will elevate the cookies from simple desert to decadent snack., The texture will stay roughly the same, but you'll get the sweet, slightly tropical touch of coconut flavor that will take any guests by welcome surprise. You can add as much or as little as you want, though at least 1-1/2 cups of oats is best to help the cookies keep their shape.
 You won't need the hand mixer, and can instead mix by hand. Add the following ingredients together and mix until it forma a paste, then mix in everything else like normal:


1/2 cup applesauce
4 tablespoons almond butter
4 tablespoons ground flax seed
