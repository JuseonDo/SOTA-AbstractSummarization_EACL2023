 You may want to buy a slightly larger size, because hamsters grow just like us, and one day they may just grow out of their little hideout!;
, Just put a bit into the house and leave the rest just by the house.
 Hamsters normally like to arrange the stuff themselves.
 Your hamster won't like to fall asleep on a pile of hamster dung.
 If they do not like it, try using softer and less or more toilet paper.
 Eating toilet paper can cause some problems for hamsters.
