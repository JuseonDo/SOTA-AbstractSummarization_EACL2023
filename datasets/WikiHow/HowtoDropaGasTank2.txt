, Most fuel tanks have a 12 to 20 gallon (45.4 to 75.7Â L) capacity, so if your fuel gauge is working properly, you can estimate the amount of fuel in your tank. Get the EPA/Underwriter's Laboratory approved gas container ready below your car in a position to catch the draining fuel. Remove the drain plug if your car has one, being careful not to allow the fuel to spill on your person when it begins to drain.
