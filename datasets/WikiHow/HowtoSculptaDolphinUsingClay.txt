 Find a picture or a photograph of a dolphin on the Internet and print it out. If you don't have a printer, try to draw the design or trace it off the computer image or from a book image.;
, Blue, silver, and gray are good color choices., Try to mold the clay flat onto the picture as well as you can. Don't sculpt the details––only do the outlines at this stage.
 Add more clay to the outline but don't mess up the overall shape. Begin shaping and smoothing the clay until the dolphin had a rounded body and bottle-nose. Be careful not to spoil the shape. Add a tiny bit of water if the clay is cracking or too dry, and use a small bit of it and rub it around the clay dolphin.
 The shape will eventually emerge but its important to smooth out the shape. Next, fill in the details of the eyes, fins, and mouth.
 Or put it in the oven until it looks hard.,
