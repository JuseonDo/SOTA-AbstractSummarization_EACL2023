 It should be plump and fat, preferably as wide or wider than the space between the gecko's shoulders. The tail should be somewhat rounded and not have a shriveled appearance.;
,,, Some leopard geckos are born with missing toes, but any that are infected are not sanitary and could cost lots of money as a result. The toes should be swell-free and even.
 That could be a disease. There should not be any bones showing like ribs.
 Neither should be "glued" shut, bigger or smaller than the other, dirty or sticky. Avoid geckos with bug-eyes or small eyes.
 They should be semi-formed and somewhat pellet shaped. The color should be dark with white urates. Pale, yellow-orange, light-colored, runny or pasty feces results in a sick gecko; signs of possible disease.
 It should have a clear and flush vent without swelling, fecal smearing, or caked material. Also, the gecko should be alert and watchful with bright eyes.
