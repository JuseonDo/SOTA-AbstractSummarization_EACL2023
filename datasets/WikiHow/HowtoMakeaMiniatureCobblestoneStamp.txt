 Put its thickness at about half an inch. Use the sculpting tools to cut it into a rectangular shape.;

 This is best done using a craft knife or other very thin tool so as to not damage the pattern.
 Sometimes the stamp will turn out rounded on the top. If this happens then sand the stamp down until it is even.
 Press fairly hard to ensure a proper stamp into the foam. If your foam is larger than your stamp, rotate the stamp as you continue stamping to vary the rocks. For a more well defined pattern you can trace over the imprint with a pencil, pushing firmly but gently to deepen the cracks but not damage the foam.
