  This can include a puliogare mix (which can be purchased at local stores), either vegetable oil or butter or an equivalent substitute, and any vegetables or meats you plan to add.  The traditional South Indian dish is often made vegetarian, but as a variation you can definitely add diced pieces of chicken or fish, or even soy or tofu.
  You can do this in a rice cooker of any type. Make sure the rice is fully cooked before proceeding.,  Depending on how much rice you have the amount of butter will vary.,  Stir the rice until powder is distributed evenly.  The rice should turn a medium to dark brown.,  You can taste the rice to see if it has the desired flavor yet.  If the powder clumps together or the rice does not turn brown, try adding more butter or oil.
