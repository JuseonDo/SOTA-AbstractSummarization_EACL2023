 You need 2 4-foot (1.2 meter) boards from 1-by-3-inch (20 by 65 mm) or 1-by-4-inch (20 by 90 mm) of pine lumber.;
, The finished flat will measure 8 feet (2.4) tall.


Lumber dimensions refer to the unfinished boards, so 1-by-3-inch lumber actually measures 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) (19 mm) by 2-1/2 inches (64 mm). And, 1-by-4-inch lumber actually measures 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) (19 mm) by 3-1/2 inches (89 mm).
If you're using 1-by-3-inch lumber, the stiles should be cut to 91 inches (230 cm) (2.31 m); if using 1-by-4-inch lumber, cut the stiles to 89 inches (230 cm) (2.26 m).
 Don't attach the boards to one another.



One board will become the toggle. Place this inside the frame between the two stiles so it divides the frame into equal top and bottom sections.
Two boards will serve as corner braces. Cut these on the miter and place them between the top rail and left stile, and the bottom rail and left stile.
 Attach them to the 4 corners of the frame, where the rails meet the stiles, with carpenters glue and pneumatic staples.
 Use these to attach the corner braces to the rails and stiles and to attach the left side of the toggle to the left stile. Use glue and staples.
 Attach this to the right side of the toggle to the right stile with glue and staples.
 Lay the cloth over the frame and staple it into place along the insides of the rails and stiles.
 Paint the boards with thinned carpenter's glue and smooth the edges back down.
, It will stiffen and shrink slightly, becoming taut.
