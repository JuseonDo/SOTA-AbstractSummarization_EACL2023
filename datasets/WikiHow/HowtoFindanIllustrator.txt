 Once your quest for the right illustrator has ended the next step is knowing how to instruct the artist to draw what you have in mind. The best way to be satisfied with the art you order is to be extremely clear in your instructions. The artist will appreciate a concise, to the point order. Below is a list of questions designed to help organize your requests.;
,,, For example: A drawing of a collie dog, walking down a lane, in profile, past a line of trees with a clear, blue, cloudless sky in background. The dog should be wearing a collar and have a pleasant expression.
,,,,, Some artists will charge for finding reference material as it can be very time consuming. You might consider finding the reference to save fees.
 Do you want the artist to provide the text or leave room for your printer to place the text on the finished art. If you want the artist to do it what font should be used. If you are having your printing company place the text they can superimpose it on the digital art.
 What is the message you want to convey?

, Can you supply a digital image of the logo.
 For instance if you want a picture of a bride on a skateboard and they have drawn skateboards and brides separately you can be confident they draw them together. If the artist can draw an airplane but has not drawn a skateboard be confident they can draw the skateboard.
 Do not expect the artist to redraw the picture if you change your mind for the original layout without incurring more fees.
