 Check to see if you can insert a memory card into your phone. Many phones use a micro memory card that comes with the phone and can be inserted and removed at will.,, In some cases, your memory card reader may be too big for a micro memory card. In this case, you can get an adapter in which you can insert your micro memory card. You can then insert the adapter into the memory card reader., It connects via the USB port., You can look for the memory card reader as a removable disk in Finder or My Computer.

If you're on a Mac, open iPhoto, go to File>Import to Library and select the photos you wish to import within the memory card.
