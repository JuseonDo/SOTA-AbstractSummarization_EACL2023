 If possible, use your guinea pig's current cage to reduce stress. If that is not possible, buy a small-animal carrying/travel cage - it should be made of plastic or cloth, not metal, and none of it should be made of mesh. Make sure that you fasten the seat-belt around the cage so that it doesn't jolt around.


Two guinea pigs can be placed into one cage, but if you are taking more guinea pigs then you will need more cages for safety reasons.;
,, Never use a loose bowl as it could slide and harm your guinea pig.
 Make sure that it is attached to the cage securely so that it does not fall as this could injure your guinea pigs.


Make sure that the cage is level to stop the water from leaking - if your guinea pigs become wet then they could become cold.
Fairly large water bottles are good for longer journeys as, particularly if your car is quite warm, your guinea pig will drink a lot.
,,, If there is no room on the seats then place the guinea pigs in a footwell. Never put the guinea pigs in the boot.
 Make them feel safe. Say something like, "(guinea pig's name), you are going on a trip to (wherever) with me!"


Try not to start by speeding off, begin slowly and then build up the speed so as not to scare your piggy.
 Use that time to pet your guinea pig and refill their food supplies.


If possible, take out your guinea pigs normal hutch/cage for them to run around in for a few minutes and stretch their legs. If you have more than two guinea pigs then let them in together so they can say hello.
 A carrying cage is not suitable housing for a guinea pig, even if it is "just for a few nights."
