 See Warnings below.;
,, Label the bottle so that you know what the contents are, especially if you intend on storing it for reuse.
 Leave it overnight. It needs this time for the clove oil to react with the mold spores.
 Allow to air dry, such as on the clothes line; a bit of sunshine will also do it some good.
 After washing, simply rehang it. It should now be clean and mold-free again.
