Does he like frat boy humour or does he enjoy a drier wit? This will be easy to discover as you spend more time with him and get to know what his favourite TV shows or movies are. Having a night at his or your house is the perfect way to do this.
Once you get a feel for his sense of humour, cracking a joke or preparing a witty comeback should be met with a hearty chuckle. Don't do this too often or it will start to look a bit weird. If he likes mean jokes then you can do some but be careful not to hurt other's feelings.



Nothing lights up a person's eyes more than a conversation about their favourite interests or hobbies. A few of these should get you going!
Though you may not know much about cars, entering a conversation with him about it and showing a genuine interest in it will surely bring a smile to his face. This is perfect and even if you get bored let him stop the conversation rather than yourself.
 Laugh at his corny jokes. Compliment him on his new shirt. Making him feel good about himself will be one of many reasons he'll want you around and often. Be careful not to do this too often as some men might grow tired of constantly being complimented

, Make him feel like you enjoy his company, and he will begin to enjoy yours.
,, Lightly touching his arm during conversation or holding his hand is a way to express your interest.
, Letting him know that you trust him and have feelings for him gives him an opportunity to reciprocate those feelings.
 This tells him that you are thinking about him.
 When he talks, be active in the conversation. Show that you care about what he's telling you.
 You have nothing to lose. Smiling at a boy is the best way to show your interest, and you can tell pretty quickly if he is also interested.
