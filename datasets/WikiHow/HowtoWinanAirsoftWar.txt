 The only way to win against opponent is to work as a team! Buy walkie-talkies in order to help to communicate easily throughout the battlefield so that you can co-operate.;
, Stealthy people in Airsoft are the ones to succeed the most! Instead of running loudly around just maintain low profile and move slowly but steadily. If you are a squad leader than research hand signals. These are useful when your enemy is nearby. It saves you talking and aids in keeping stealthy.
 Your opponents will find it easy to find you, overrun you and finally hunt you down. When you move make sure to watch and listen carefully. React to any suspicious sound near you.
 Squad Leader is a very tough role and requires a great deal of stress management and confidence. Make sure the Squad Leader is well trained and understands the role.
 Snipers are your worst enemies and are feared throughout the battlefield. Snipers usually are well camouflaged so make sure you maintain low profile and keep stealth as well as watching and listening everything around you.
 Most of the work is done by yourself but having a good gun doesn't hurt.
 If you will run overconfident in yourself then you will be the first one to be out of the game! Make sure you get steady approach.
 It is always better to stay in one place just a bit longer to plan where are you going to move and what you are going to do rather than just running around spraying and praying for a lucky hit. If you're a sniper than think before you shoot as well! Shooting might get you spotted easily and you want to avoid it!
