 Since this frosting has such a soft texture, it's easiest to apply it to the cake while the cake turns on the turntable. This reduces the mess and ensures an even, smooth application.
, Turn the turntable to work on a fresh area as you finish the current area.
 Use a flexible icing spatula or round-bladed knife to quickly work over the entire frosting and leave it smooth, with tiny peaks here and there.,
Place a dollop of frosting on the top.
Use a round-bladed knife to swirl the frosting around the top. Try to do this in one continuous movement. As you swirl, push the frosting to the edges of the cupcake.
Leave a peaked center and a swirled edge.
