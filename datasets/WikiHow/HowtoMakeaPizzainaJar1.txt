 If you're doing homemade, combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into a mixer bowl and combine the ingredients.


As the mixer is running, add water and 2 tablespoons of oil and beat until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is sticky, add more bread flour. If the dough is too dry, add small amounts additional water to moisten.
Scrape the dough together onto a lightly floured surface and begin to knead into a smooth ball for 10 minutes. Continue adding flour when the ball becomes too sticky
A good way to test if the dough has been kneaded enough is to raise the ball of dough a foot above the surface and drop it, if the ball stays in tact then you are good to go, if not then keep kneading.
Glaze a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil, then add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm area for about an hour to allow it to double in size.
Take the dough, and once again place it on a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Cover each piece with plastic wrap and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.;
,,


Two pieces of dough will be used for each jar.



This dough will end up being the bottom piece of bread in our pizza.

The water should reach at least halfway up the sides of the jars.
,


The order of the layers will not affect the taste of the dish so layer as you please!

,,


Allow for the dough to bake for 15-20 minutes or until crisp and brown.
,


Dry the jars with the dishcloth or paper towels.
