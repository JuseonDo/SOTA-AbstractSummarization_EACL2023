 Too much oatmeal and your burger patty will fall apart, so experiment with less first and add gradually if needed.


Alternately, try using bean paste or cooked rice.;
, Not only will this stretch the beef, it'll also hold the burgers together better., Two common ones are salt and pepper.
,, For a low-carb approach, wrap the burger in large pieces of lettuce (iceberg works best).
 Below are ideas for toppings:


Mayo
Lettuce
Tomatoes
Other meats (deli meat, bacon)
Cheese (cheddar, muenster, pretty much any cheese you desire)
Pickles
Onions or peppers
Ranch dressing
Grilled pineapple slices
