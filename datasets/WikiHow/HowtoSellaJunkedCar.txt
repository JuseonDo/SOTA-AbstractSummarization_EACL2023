If economically feasible, get your car in running condition; running vehicles can fetch exponentially more than cars that are not.;

Individuals and companies will only buy junk cars if the title is secured by the owner.
If the title is misplaced, you may acquire one from your local DMV as the title is on record.


This can be found in your owner's manual.
Buyers will need to know the above including what is wrong with the car.



Be thorough in your research as certain offers from buyers can be twice as much as others.



Clean out your junk car, removing all valuables and trash.
Ask the scrap-metal dealer what is required of the condition of the vehicle before they will buy it. Some dealers want all the windows removed, along with the tires, seats, and even plastic molding. Most aren't that tedious, but that's why you must ask.
Make sure to remove anything that might pose an identity theft problem. Remove all your personal belongings, namely anything that may have personal information on it.
