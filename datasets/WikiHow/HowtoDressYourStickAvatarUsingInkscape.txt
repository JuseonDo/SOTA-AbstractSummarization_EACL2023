 This article will dress the female avatar because it is more complicated. (It's the curves!);
,, This will be for a bit of skin showing at her neck, so remember that. You can draw one, or create a shape by clicking on the 'Stars and Polygons' icon and then choose star and give it three corners.
 You may need to rotate it a bit.
 While still selected, hit 'Page Down' and it will go down a layer and stay on top of the dress while under the head.
 This will be the tops and bottoms of her clothes.
 You are making the tops of her pants, in effect. Choose a color that you like for her pants.



To fill an area, once you have added a line with the line tool (making sure there are no gaps), use the paint bucket to fill in the area.
