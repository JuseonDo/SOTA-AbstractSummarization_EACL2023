to do the second position with your feet, take the first position, and spread your feet a little apart so that your heels are not touching.

@summary
pretend your arms are holding a giant penny.
@article
 Open your feet to hip distance apart with the knees pointing side and the toes turned out.
 Pretend that the penny got much bigger so that to try to get your arms around it, you have to open them wide so that they are over your feet.


Your arms should be at your sides, palms pointing forward, elbows slightly relaxed, and thumbs tucked in.
