, This will offset the contouring and accentuate different areas of your face.Use a concealer that is one to two shades lighter than your skin.
Move from the center of your hairline to the center of your forehead, down the bridge of your nose, the cheekbones under the outer corners of your eyes, and the center of your chin.
Highlight under your eyes in an upside-down triangle shape. This will brighten your eyes.
 Using an angular motion, blend the blush from the apples of your cheeks back towards the temples. The idea is to draw a triangle that points towards your nose. Avoid getting the color too close to your ears.
