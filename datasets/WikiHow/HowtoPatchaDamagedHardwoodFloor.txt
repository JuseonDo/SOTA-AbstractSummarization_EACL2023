@summary
determine the size of the pieces you need to replace.

@summary
visit a lumberyard, home-improvement store, floor-covering store or mill workshop.

@summary
research a stain color that will match your floor, at a home improvement store.

@summary
bore a hole through each end of the damaged board that is about 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, using a sharp spade bit on your drill.

@summary
using a straight edge, draw lines connecting the right edges of the holes and then connecting the left edges.

@summary
take your circular saw and adjust the blade so that the depth of the cut you will make will be equal to the thickness measurement of the boards.

@summary
remove the blade guard, place the nose of the saw down at the top edge of the line.

@summary
use your hammer and chisel to pry out the middle section.

@summary
trim a new board using a saw.

@summary
use a urethane adhesive on the tongue of the new board and on the tongue and groove of the surrounding boards.

@summary
stain the replacement board until it matches the surrounding boards.

 Locate a threshold or a heat register and lift it out. Measure the thickness and width of the board. Next measure the length of the piece you want to remove.;
, Buy pieces of wood that match your flooring measurements. You want to buy pieces that are the same width, but they do not have to be the same length, since you will cut them down. The board should be retrofitted with grooves to fit into place in your floor. If not, you will bevel the board using a saw.
 Test them on scrap boards and compare against your floor. Buy a polyurethane finish. You will stain after the work has been completed.
 Upon installation, tongue and grove hardwood floors are locked into place; this step will allow you to remove them.
 This is where you will plunge cut with your circular saw.
 Wear eye protection and plug the saw into an outlet.
 Raise the saw above the floor, turn it on and then cut along the right line. Then, cut along the left line.
 Carefully, lop off the remaining edges. You do not want to hit the surrounding floorboards. The tongue section is nailed in place, so you must remove it in small pieces and then use the hammer to remove the nails. Remove any remaining parts of the tongue. This is likely to be the hardest part of the process.
 Measure carefully to make sure it is a perfect rectangle. The tongue will fit into the existing tongue groove. However, the other end will drop into place, rather than fit into the tongue. Remove a section of the groove using your saw or a chisel. Test the board.
 Place the new board in the empty space. Tap it into place by using a scrap of wood for protection. Cut a sheet of wax paper and place it above the board, then use heavy books to weight it down.
 Cover with 2 coats of polyurethane varnish using a foam applicator to avoid getting varnish or stain on other floorboards. Some floors may not be stained, but be sure to still cover the board with the varnish to protect it from future damage.
