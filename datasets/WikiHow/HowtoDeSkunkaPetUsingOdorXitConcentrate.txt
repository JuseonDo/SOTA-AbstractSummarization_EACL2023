 The detergent aspect of the shampoo is important because it changes the nature of the oily substance that is causing the odor. The very warm water makes it easier to wash and rinse your pet because their body temperature is higher than yours and they are always wearing their coat. When you wet their coat it looses all of its insulation ability and if the water is too cool, your pet gets cold. If your shower is big enough for you and your pet, and you have a hand sprayer, using the shower and hand sprayer works really well.;
, Avoid getting the shampoo in your pets eyes, but since the chances are very good that it was sprayed in the face, it is necessary to wash as much of its face, snout and ears as possible. It is normally not necessary to wash down inside their ears, but if their ears stand up naturally, it may be necessary, just use a minimal amount of water and let them shake it out right away.
, Do not dry your pet at this point.
 When treating the face and surrounding areas, using a small kitchen sponge works very well but you still need to get the coat and skin wet with the mixture.
, Therefore, it is critical to get the OdorXit solution into all the folds. If you miss a spot and discover it later, just re-wet the smelly area with the OdorXit solution and allow it to dry naturally. If your pet's paws have skunk spray odor on them, dip the whole paw in the solution.
