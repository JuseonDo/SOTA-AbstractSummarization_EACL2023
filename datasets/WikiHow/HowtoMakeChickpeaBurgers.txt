 You aren't after a smooth paste, but a paste that still has some texture in it.
The goal is to observe when it start to form a mass in the processor bowl as that's the sign that the chickpeas are processed enough to be able to form burgers. If your paste is too coarse or too dry, they may fall apart when cooking.;
, Additional seasonings to taste can include - some lemon or lime zest, freshly chopped chilli.
 Chill in the fridge until needed, or at least 10 minutes. This makes them more stable for frying.
At the same time, make your salad, prepare your breads and everything you wish to serve with these.
 A large flat BBQ plate or electric frypan is easier for larger burgers.
 Fry until golden and keep hot. If you are cooking a lot of these, then put the first batches to stay hot in the oven.
Turn only once if you can help it - larger, thinner burgers are more likely to break than smaller patties.
 Leftover cooked rissoles are excellent cold for lunch on a hot day, or as an appetizer with a dipping sauce.
