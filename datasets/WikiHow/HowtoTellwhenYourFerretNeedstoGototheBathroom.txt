 When a ferret is trying to climb onto a nearby object, it may just want to explore. But if it seems as if they do not want to be held, this may signify that the ferret needs to use the toilet.;
, They usually sniff the area before they decide to mark it, and also normally back into a corner to drop their waste (ferrets are clean animals). A ferret will continue to urinate when picked up, so be careful.
 Ferrets can sleep many hours a day, up to three times the amount a human can. You can imagine how a ferret would need to use the bathroom after napping so long.
 If your ferret is making these sounds, let it use the bathroom right away. Making a ferret hold its tiny little bladder is not only unjust but might hurt it.
 Although they also lift their tails up on many other occasions, so this cannot be depended on.
