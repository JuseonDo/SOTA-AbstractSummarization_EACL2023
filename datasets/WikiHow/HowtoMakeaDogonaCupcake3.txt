 Make one ball slightly smaller than the other ball., The smaller ball is the dog's head, the larger is its body. Shape the head to make it slightly elongated at the front, to create a "snout"., Shape these like fat sausages. Attach to the dog's body where legs should fit. The base of each leg needs to be flat and wide enough to support the weight of the dog. Use a small tool to mark paw lines.

The dog is supported by the legs using this method. An alternative way is to use the body as the support, making a flat base on the body piece, then attaching the legs as if the dog is sitting on its hind legs and begging with its forelegs.
 Attach these to the sides of the dog's head for ears., This is best done in a contrasting color to the head and body color. Attach to the end of the snout for a nose., Add to the face where the eyes should be placed., Attach at the end of the dog's body., Place on the cake where you wish to display the dog.
