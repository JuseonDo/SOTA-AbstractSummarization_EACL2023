 They can be whatever you want. Just make sure you will be comfortable. I recommend a sleep T-shirt or tank top, sleep shorts, slippers, and a robe if you have one.;
, If you would like, lay them out on your bed and just take your robe or slippers in the bathroom, and after you shower, you could get dressed in your room. Whatever you want.
 Start by brushing your hair out thoroughly. Doing this will give the blood vessels in your head a stimulation, causing more blood flow to the head. Brushing your hair before showering will also let shampoo and conditioner clean your hair more thoroughly.
 Get into the shower and thoroughly wet your entire body, leaving not an inch of yourself dry.
 Focus mostly on your scalp and the tips of you hair.
 Leave the Conditioner in for 3-5 Minutes.
 Wash yourself Thoroughly. Don't forget to scrub your feet, underarms, behind your ears, neck, and your private parts.
 Get a bit of soap or shaving cream, and rub it on your legs. Slowly and softly bring the razor up your legs, being careful not to cut yourself. If you tend to shake and accidentally cut yourself while shaving, inhale and then when you slowly exhale, slowly pull the razor up your leg. The exhale will calm you, leaving you less shaky. Do the same with your underarms if necessary.
 This will close your pores up after taking a hot shower.
 You can also do this for your hair if you want. Get a face towel and blot your face to dry it. Do not rub! It will irritate your face and cause skin peeling and redness.
 Use an exfoliating scrubby with a reputable face wash. Good brands to use are Neutrogena and Aveeno.
 Blow drying it will cause heat damage. Nothing about split ends and dry, lifeless hair is pretty.
, This will make your nails look healthy and shiny without even trying. You could also paint your nails, if you'd like. Nail art is optional.
 Clip your toenails and add fresh coats of paint.
 Now you probably feel fresh and beautiful!
