,,,,,,, Search the sentences of a page for the main idea. Skip over text that is less interesting or relevant: this is especially important for online reading.
 Guide your eyes using a finger or pointer, such as a pen, in order for the eye to move faster along the length of a passage of text. Draw invisible shapes on a page of text in order to broaden the visual span for speed reading. Using a finger or pen to make these shapes on a page will speed up your visual cortex, increase your visual span to take in the whole line, and even imprint the information into your subconscious for later retrieval. It also reduces subvocalization, thereby speeding up reading.
 When unfamiliar material is discovered, take care to learn them thoroughly, so you can process the new information for greater comprehension.
