 This will be the head.;
, Attach it to the right or left side of the head; this will be the body. Make it a little smaller than the head.
 This will be the tail - take care to make it small.
 Make two at the bottom facing up, as these are the back legs, and two half-ovals pointing out below the head as front legs.
 These can be round or almond shaped; make them as large as possible and add decorations as pictured to the right.
 The nose should be roughly triangular, and the mouth shaped in a grin.
 It’s recommended that you keep them reasonably short. To make them look more realistic, you can use a thin mechanical pencil.
 Begin with a large outer circle, and draw within that a smaller circle.
 You can add markings, tufts of hair, and color.
