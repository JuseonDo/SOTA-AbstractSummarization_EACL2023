 Are you going to be a class hamster, pet hamster, magic hamster, or just a wild hamster?

, Light gray, brown, black and pale yellow are the most common colors on a hamster, so it is recommended that you choose those. But, if you don't want to choose those, that's fine, too - you get to choose!

, The best patterns on a hamster are spots, dots, and stripes. However, if you don't want any of those patterns, you can choose another one! (Skip this step if you don't want a pattern.)

, You will be pretending this animal is a hamster. Bunnies are recommended,because have you ever seen a hamster the size of a wolf or tiger? But the best animal is probably the Koala. They have hamster ears, and are small.
