 Although doing this gives the opponent more time, it is a very charismatic move, and is also precise., You need to start the run when you're in the final third, otherwise you will not have enough space, especially if you're new to the technique., While controlling the ball with light touches, put your intoe at the base of the ball (like you do in a lob pass), and push the ball slightly upwards, with small force., The final move is similar to that of the midfielder, except that you will be using your lower laces (the base of your foot), at an approximate 20°, and your kicking foot will be facing the "D" (wherever you want the cross to go).
