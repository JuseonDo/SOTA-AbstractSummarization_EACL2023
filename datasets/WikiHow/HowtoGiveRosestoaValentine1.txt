@summary
buy five to ten real roses and one fake rose.

@summary
write the following words on a piece of paper: "i will love you until the last rose wilts..." experiment with different fonts and colours for the best effect.

@summary
arrange your flowers so that they are in a bunch with the fake rose in the middle.

@summary
meet up with your valentine in a quiet place that has some significance to both of you, such as a park or a quiet café/restaurant where you shared your first date.

@summary
watch your valentine's smile light up as you present them with their bunch of roses.
@article
 Get the roses from a quality flower shop and on the day that you will present your Valentine with them. This adds to the freshness and scent of your roses.;
, Make sure that the piece of paper is the same size as a post-it note.
 Tie up the bunch with some red, silk ribbon. Stick on the quote. Alternatively, you could tuck it behind the ribbon so that it is still visible, but you would have to pull it out to read it.
 Make it personalized so the person feels extra-special. Remember to bring your roses!

, The idea is that the middle (last) rose is fake so it will never wilt, indicating that you will love them forever. This method is for the more romantic type, so if your lover isn't really into that sort of thing, it is best to avoid this.
