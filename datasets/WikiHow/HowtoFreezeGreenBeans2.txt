, Take them out of the freezer bag and spread them in an even layer over a baking sheet. Some of the beans may be frozen together in clumps; separate them as much as you can using your fingers and a fork.
 Olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil and grapeseed oil are all good choices.
 Sprinkle lightly with other seasonings if you wish, like cayenne pepper, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, or any other spices that you like with vegetables. Toss the green beans to make sure they are thoroughly coated.
 Cook them for ten minutes, then remove them from the oven and use a spatula to stir them around. Place them back in the oven and cook until parts of them look brown and crispy, about five more minutes.
 Add additional seasonings or grated cheese if desired. Serve hot.
