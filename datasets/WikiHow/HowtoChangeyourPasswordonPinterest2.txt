 The first thing you need to do is to ensure the Pinterest app is downloaded on your phone.
, Once you are on the main screen, tap the Menu button on your phone and go to the “Account Settings.”

,, On the new box, enter your old password followed by the new password.


You can also ask it to show the password so you know you are not making a mistake, considering it only gives you one chance to enter your password, as opposed to the computer procedure.
After you are done, select “Change” and your password is changed!
