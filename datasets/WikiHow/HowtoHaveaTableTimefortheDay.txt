 Make sure it is a time that every member of the family can make, and that it is convenient in general; there's no use trying to schedule meetings when your sister is in a rush to get to dance class or your mother is trying to write a shopping list.;
, Make sure it is alright with everyone - if not it's a good idea to try to reschedule, as it is important that everyone tries to be there.
 If you have separate space for each family member write it across everybody's schedule, so that they cannot schedule anything over it by accident.
 A whiteboard is a good idea for this as people can add and remove things as they wish. Stick it up on a wall and leave a pen nearby. This way everyone can add to the agenda and all take part in shaping the meeting.
 Wait for all the family members and then discussing the things that are on the agenda.


Make sure to listen to every family member who wants to share their opinion, and ask anyone who hasn't given theirs what they think. Don't force a family member into speaking, though; they may prefer to stay silent when some things are discussed, but encourage them all the same.
Try to come to a good conclusion about everything on the agenda. Make sure that there are no negative feelings left in the air, and offer solutions to any problem that may arise. Being able to resolve problems like this will encourage family members that table time is a great time to find solutions to things.
 If not table time is over and you may all go back to your previous activities, hopefully feeling a lot closer and positive about family life. Make sure that you let your family know when the next meeting will be and ensure that this is alright with them. Communication is key.
