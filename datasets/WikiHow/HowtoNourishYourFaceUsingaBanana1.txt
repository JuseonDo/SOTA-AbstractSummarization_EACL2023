 This will make enough banana facial to last you a few days.;
, Take care to avoid the sensitive area around the eyes. If you have any leftovers, place them into a jar, and refrigerate them.
 During this time, the nutrients in the banana will soothe and nourish your skin. While you wait, try to keep your head upright, so that the mask doesn't slide off.
 If necessary, use a gentle face cleaner. When you are done, splash your face with cool water, to seal the pores. Pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel.
 As you continue to use the facial, your face will start to feel softer. You may also notice dark marks and other blemishes disappearing as well.
