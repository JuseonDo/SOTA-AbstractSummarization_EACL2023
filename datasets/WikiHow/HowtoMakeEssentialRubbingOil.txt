 So in a 50ml bottle use up to 20 drops in total of essential oil, in a 100ml bottle use up to 40 drops. For a massage oil for children or anyone whose health is frail or who has sensitive skin, halve this number. Remember you can use 2 or 3 different essential oils in your blend but the total number of drops should together not exceed that stated.;
, Put on the cap and shake gently or tip the bottle back and forth to mix the oils together.
 Information to note includes the date, the name of the person the oil is for and the purpose of the oil, together with the ingredients. This way you can easily reproduce your blend.
 Use for massages as needed. The product should be used within 6 months of making it.
