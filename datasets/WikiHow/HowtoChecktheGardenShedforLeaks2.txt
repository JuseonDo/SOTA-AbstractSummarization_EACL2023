 Examine the shed both inside and out for visible signs of damage. Examples may include torn waterproof felt on the roof, and damaged shingles or tiles.


There may also be cracks in the structure of the shed caused by damaged or warped wood.
 Water can also penetrate the shed from the ground. To combat this, you should put your shed on top of a concrete base, or suspend it with breeze blocks and pressure treated timber. If the shed was not raised off the ground when it was constructed, you are more vulnerable to water coming in from below.
 Ideally you should cast a concrete base slightly larger than your shed base. To do this:


Use wooden planks to define the area and contain the concrete. Lay about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of hardcore and then 6 inches (15.2 cm) of concrete on top of that.
You can anchor your shed to the concrete base using bolts. It’s important that the water drains away from the shed and doesn’t pool against the edges.
 If you don’t want to lay a concrete base, you can sink some paving slabs or breeze blocks so the top edge is slightly above ground level by about an inch. Lay wooden planks above these as a base for your shed. This keeps the shed above the damp ground and lets air circulate underneath., It’s important that any timber in contact with the ground is pressure-treated and painted with or soaked in wood preservative to make it resistant to damp.
