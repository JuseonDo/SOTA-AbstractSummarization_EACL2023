 The grits doesn't take up much space. The amount of water determines how runny your grits will be. For "Georgia Ice Cream", we want it to be a bit soupy, the consistency of soft ice cream.;
, Turn the heat all the way up to get the water boiling as fast as you can.
 Use your judgment. The salt causes the water to boil at a higher temperature, as well as stratifying your personal taste.
 If serving to several people with different sweetener preference, stir in the sweetener when served.
 The butter gives it a creamy flavor. Adding it to the water at this time will permit it to inundate the grits and keep it from getting lumpy.
, The grits try to pop out of the pot. Use a long handled spoon.
 For a gas stove, wait about 30 seconds and put it on medium to low.
, This depends on the type of grits (Quick, 5-Minute, or the real thing).
