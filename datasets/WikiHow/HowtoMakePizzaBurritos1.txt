, After you've picked the ingredients, cut them into standard pizza topping sizes. Then put them on the burrito tortilla.
 Do this in just the same way as you'd wrap a standard burrito. Place on a baking sheet or tray, ready for baking.
 Bake the pizza burrito with the contents inside for as long as you like and as hot as you like, or just until the cheese is melted.
