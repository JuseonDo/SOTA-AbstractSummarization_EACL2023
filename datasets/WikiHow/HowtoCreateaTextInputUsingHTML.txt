@summary
create an html page.

@summary
put in the code.

@summary
now that you have the base code, you're ready to make a form to hold the text box and then make the text box.

@summary
save the page.

@summary
open up the window and see your new text box!
@article
 To do that, open up Notepad or any other plain text editor. On Windows, you can access Notepad via the Start Menu, at: "Accessories", then "Notepad". Or, use the Windows key + R, then type notepad and press enter.
 Write the normal tags (<html><head></head><body></body></html>), and it should look like:

,

Between the two body tags, (<body> and </body>), type: <form name="test">.






Next the actual input element, type: <input type="text" name="textie">.






Finally, close the form tag, type: </form>.
 Click "File", "Save As", and then save it as test.html. Or, save it as anything.html.



Using JavaScript, now you could make the text box do something in conjunction with a button!
If you want to put some text before the input box to explain what it is, do so before the <input> tag.
