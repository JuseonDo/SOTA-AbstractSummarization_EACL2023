 You can perform this method using any browser, but not all websites allow you to find the file this way.
 Most browsers also allow you to press Ctrl+U or ⌘ Cmd+U to open the webpage's source code.
,,, The Flash file will usually have a filename that's similar to the title of the movie or video. Sometimes this address will be obvious, but other times it will be obfuscated by the website creator.


The URL may be changed by the website owner to appear invalid. For example, Newgrounds often adds additional slashes to make the URL invalid. You can remove the extra slashes to make a working URL. http:\/\/uploads.ungrounded.net\/643000\/645362_examplegame.swf would be turned into http://uploads.ungrounded.net/643000/645362_examplegame.swf.
Some Flash videos will have an .mp4 version that you can download instead. This will be easier to open, as it will work in on most devices and video players.
 Make sure that you've fixed the URL if it requires fixing. Press ↵ Enter and the Flash file should load in the new tab without the website that was hosting it.
 Select "Save as" or "Save page as". This will download the .swf file to the location of your choosing.


If you can't see the File menu, press Alt.
 Once you've saved the Flash file to your computer, you can open it by dragging it into an open web browser window. Click here for more details on playing .swf files.
