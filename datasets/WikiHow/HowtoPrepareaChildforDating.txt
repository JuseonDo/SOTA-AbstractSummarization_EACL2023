 The time to offer sound advice, and to let the young person know what to expect during a date is before the event.;
, You might go into details such as what is appropriate clothing for different activities, depending on how well the young person already deals with those things.
 There may be specific issues for you to deal with such as choosing from a menu at an eating establishment if someone has always helped them deal with that previously.
 If you have taught them the difference between right and wrong, and how to resist peer pressure and other influences, you should be able to trust them to make good choices.
 Talk to his parents, as well, to see what upbringing he has had.
 Make sure the ground rules are established such as whether the child should call home at intervals, what time the date will be over, and exactly where they will be going.
 Never push the young person to go out just to follow social requirements; the young person should be the one to decide if they are ready for a date.
