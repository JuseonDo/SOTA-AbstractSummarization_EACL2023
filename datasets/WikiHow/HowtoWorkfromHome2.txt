 Choose an area in your home that has good natural light and is well ventilated. Working in the basement or a closet will really start to close in on you after a few hours at work and will not encourage you to ‘go to work’ each day.


Think about the furniture in the space too. A desk and chair are essential. Although you may not be in an office environment, you are still doing an income producing activity and therefore you should set yourself up as professionally as possible. Working at the dining room table is a viable option if you do not have a separate study or office area in your home, so long as you are preparing your work area daily and it’s not cluttered with household items., Getting organized is the first step to a really productive day. The main steps are decluttering, strategically organizing forms and information, and maintaining that organization. First, get rid of anything you don't need while you're at work. Knick knacks and family photos are ok, but anything else should be put in another room. You need to create a clean space free of distractions. Second, determine what forms or information (e.g. business cards, standard forms, email lists, payroll logs, or data reports) you need to have readily available. Purchase folders and place each kind of information in the same place. This way you'll know where to find it in the future. Third, at the end of everyday, do some basic maintenance to your organization system. Make sure all forms are put away properly. This way when you arrive in the morning, you won't be confronted with a mess.Arrange your work area with all the "office" tools you need (e.g. printer, PC/laptop, stationery). A carafe of water, phone chargers, and a great filing system are other essential things you'll need., Make to-do lists with the most important tasks at the top. As the day progresses, you’ll have fewer and perhaps easier tasks to complete. It will keep you motivated during the day.


In your day planner/diary, write down all the things that need to be done – everything from doing the laundry to making those important calls. Block out times for them as accurately as possible. Try a weekly/monthly planner to see your tasks at a glance. Alternatively, you can put a number next to each task in order of importance. For example, the top priorities of the day would get a number 1, the lowest priorities would get a number 5. This will assist you in ensuring you have great time management and are productive., Decide what your office hours are and stick to them. Take into account your household chores, kids (if you have any), personal commitments, and plan your office hours accordingly. Your business/work-from-home job is your main priority, so make sure you set your office hours and commit to working within this time frame. It's best to keep your office hours as consistent as possible., The sooner you get into your routine, the better and more productive you will become. Work at times when you have the most energy. Work everyday at those times.You will be surprised at how your creativity and concentration increases after having set specific working hours and routines when you need it most, and in the evenings when it is time to wind down, your mind will be more relaxed.
 Social media in the workplace can be a big time-waster. Not only does it take time to post, chat, and tag, it also disrupts your work flow. You'll find yourself stopping and starting repeatedly.If you have problems with this, there are various software programs that will block access to such sites. Look up programs like Freedom and Anti-Social.
