Once you find it, press the A button to open it in the Snap screen.,, Go down to the text field and hit the A button. A keyboard will pop up and you can name your broadcast. If you want more viewers, try to use a name that will catch people’s attention, like “Minecraft Map Mansion.” As long as it is catchy, people will view your broadcasts., Scroll down to the bottom of the Twitch screen and hit A on “Start Broadcasting.” Tap the center button on your Xbox controller one more time, and Twitch will unsnap, putting your focus back on the game, but you will still be broadcasting. Your number of viewers will be at the bottom of the screen., The more interesting your world, the more viewers you will get!

You can edit two settings if you double-tap the center button and hit right on the D-pad. Twitch will snap back to your screen, and right next to the “End Broadcast” button will be a gear box. Highlight the gear box, and you can check or uncheck the mic icon so people can hear you talk as you play. You can also change the quality by hitting the A button on the quality box. Three different quality boxes will pop up, from highest to lowest. Pick the one that best supports your Internet connection.
In order to end the broadcast, double-tap the center button and hit the right button on the D-pad. Twitch will snap back to your screen, and you just need to hit A on the “End Broadcast” button at the top of the Twitch Screen.
