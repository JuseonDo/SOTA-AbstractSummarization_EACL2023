, If you know where the secret base is, Fort Carson is the small town just south of the base. Go there and look for a Freeway bike. They are lower than an NRG-500 or a PCJ-600.
 Turn off the road before the corner on the dirt road leading to the base (it looks like one of those long things you use in science lessons to pick up small bits of food)

, If you keep on the road, you'll go through an open gate. Keep on going into the outdoor area of the base.
 Go towards the vent and put the bike (with CJ still on it) parallel with the vent. Get off the bike on top of the vent. You should end up inside the base. If not, then keep trying.
