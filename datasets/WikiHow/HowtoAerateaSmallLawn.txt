 This task just needs to be completed twice a year and it is best done in early Spring and early Autumn.;
, All you need is a simple garden fork and with that you are going to make a set of holes by pushing down through the lawn and into the soil below.
 This is best done after a shower of rain as this makes the ground much softer and easier to push through.
, Some people prefer to purchase and use what are called garden aerator shoes. These are simply shoes with a set of spikes that attach to your own shoes and you simply walk backwards and forwards across your garden until the task is completed. This is a much faster way of doing the aeration.
 However when you have a larger garden this would be very time consuming. In these cases there are different machines available that will help make the task much easier to do.
