Exit codes vary depending on which country you're dialing out from. Although 011 is the exit code for the United States, Canada and a few other countries, 00 is the most common exit code in Europe.;

The country code remains the same, no matter where you're dialing from.
Czechoslovakia used to have the country code 42. When the country split into the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, the country code was divided: 420 for the Czech Republic and 421 for the Slovak Republic.
 Leave off the leading zero, if any.


All Czech cellular phones have a 3-digit prefix, which begins with a 6 or 7. The prefix identifies the cell-phone provider--usually either T-Mobile, Vodafone or O2.
 Non-emergency and non-information Czech numbers total 9 digits.
