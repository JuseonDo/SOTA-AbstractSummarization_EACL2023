 If your blinds have too much built up dirt, a simple dusting may not totally clean them. A deeper clean for wood blinds requires you to use water. Do not mix any cleaners or chemicals with the water.


The chemicals in traditional cleaners can create stains and streaks that can ruin your blinds., Wood blinds that make prolonged contact with water can cause your blinds to spot and warp.To avoid this, lightly dab your cloth and wring it out before you use it.


You only need a little bit of water to dampen your cloth, not totally saturate it.
 Positioning your wooden slats to an almost closed position will make wiping each individual slat easier., Using your damp rag, wipe each slat from left to right. Once you are done wiping one side, make sure that also wipe the other side.


Make sure to scrub harder on areas with stains, using a circular motion.
 Water can warp, discolor, or create spotting on wood blinds. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you get all of the water off the blinds with a dry rag.You can dry each slat with a microfiber cloth, dry sock, or a soft cotton rag.
 Clean the other side of your wooden slats by angling them onto the other side and repeat the process of wiping them down and drying them.
