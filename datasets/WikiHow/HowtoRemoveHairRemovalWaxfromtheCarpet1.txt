 Water will only make it worse. It will keep the wax from drying and allow it to sink deeper into the carpet fibers.;
, You will use these to cool the ice but you want to make sure you don’t get the wax wet. Using a plastic bag will keep moisture from leaking into the wax which can prevent it from drying., Do this until the wax is cooled completely and no longer soft.If you need a little extra strength you can use wart freezing spray. This can be found at most local drug stores. Simply spray it over the wax and let it harden.
 Be careful not to saw at the carpet fibers as they may fray. Do this a few times to ensure you've gotten rid of as much wax as possible with the knife.


Using a dull blade lessens the chance of permanent damage (such as fraying) to your carpet

, Wax will flake away under the butter knife. To ensure the wax flakes don't stray and become a problem again, vacuum them immediately.
