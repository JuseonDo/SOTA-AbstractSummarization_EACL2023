 Have the gas tank filled and the oil changed.;
, It can be with a hotel, with a relative, or even with a friend.
 If you have limited car space, use strict limitations. It's a good idea to include change for a laundromat, should you get stranded at your destination. Or, you could have everyone pack half the amount of outfits as they'd need, and do the laundry on the day they run out.
 A road map from your last road trip to your destination in 1990 will be outdated. Highlight your planned route.
 This should include a cellular phone, matches, flares and a car starter.
 If you are driving with kids, give them plenty of activities to do, especially if your destination is a long ways from your home. One possibility would be purchasing a dual screen portable DVD player so the kids can watch movies.
 If you need, stop at rest stops or the side of the road to stretch your legs or take a power nap. Coffee will not help you stay awake.
