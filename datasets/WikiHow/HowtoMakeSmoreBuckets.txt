 Avoid over-crushing because you don't want to end up with powder.;
,, Divide the pudding equally among the ramekins. Gently tap the cups on the counter to release any air bubbles from the pudding.
 Turn the bag into a piping bag by cutting a small corner of the bag. Pipe the fluff onto the pudding. It helps if you start in the center of the cup, and pipe your way outward in a spiral.
 This allows the marshmallow to settle.
 Use a cooking torch to lightly toast the marshmallows or place the cups in the oven on a baking sheet. Put it under your broiler as close as possible to the top on a high temperature setting (around 370 degrees) with the oven door slightly ajar until the marshmallow browns.
