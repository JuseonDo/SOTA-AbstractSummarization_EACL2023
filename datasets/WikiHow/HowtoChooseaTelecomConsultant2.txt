 Talk to your professional network about your telecom needs. Your peers might be able to recommend consultants they have worked with.
 Nearly every company and consultant now has an online reputation. Look for testimonials, reviews and other information online.
 The BBB website, www.bbb.org, keeps track of consumer and business reviews and also lists any lawsuits or complaints.
 A consultant who wants your business should be willing to offer the contact information for current or former clients.
 Case studies provide telecom consultants with an opportunity to publish and promote their expertise.
