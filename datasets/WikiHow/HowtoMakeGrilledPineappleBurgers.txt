 This can be accomplished before or after grilling the burgers.;
, Combine the teriyaki sauce and reserved pineapple juice in a small bowl. Add about 2-3 tablespoons of the mixture into a plastic freezer bag and set the remaining aside.
 Add the sliced pineapple to the freezer bag. Carefully cover them with the marinade and set the bag aside.
 Create four patties and season if needed. Add the patties to a square baking dish and drizzle the unused teriyaki marinade over the patties. Turn the patties over, so that both sides are "juiced" evenly.
 Allow the burgers to cook until well done on both sides (at least 160°F or 71°C).
 Allow the pineapple to heat through and remove from the heat. You want the fruit to be juicy, never dried out.
