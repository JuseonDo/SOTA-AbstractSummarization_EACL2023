 This will make you get used to the bullet drop and you will always know where to aim at certain distances.;
, Each Scope is different, they all have different distance positions and crosshair, get used to one and your a step closer.
,, If you are on a crane or building, use a Spawn Beacon so the rest of your squad can help you out. Or use a motion sensor so you know if somebody is behind you

, Your squad can help you very much in these ways Medic: Revives you so you don't use up your Beacon. Assault: If you run out of ammo, just hit the select button and your Assault member will be there. Engineer: Just in case you break down in a quick getaway

, If you stay in prone your enemy will have a little more difficulty getting a good shot and if you use a bipod, it will be better for aiming.
, If you get a nice shot on your enemy but no kill, remember to double click the mouse/right trigger/ Right 1
