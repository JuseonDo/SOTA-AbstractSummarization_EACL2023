 The bamboo basket is sturdy, but will allow the water below to permeate the basket. It is a kitchen essential and can be purchased at relatively low cost.;
, Chefs recommend organic, free-range chicken, since the flavor of the bird is more prevalent in this recipe. Save the battery chicken dishes for dish that is covered in sauce.
 Leave it in the refrigerator for one day to ensure the cavity is completely defrosted. Then, use it as soon as possible once it is ready.
 Sprinkle salt on the outside and inside of the cavity. Repeat with pepper to taste.
 Shred the ginger and dice the garlic.
 Stuff two-thirds of the garlic, ginger and chicken into the bird. Save the rest for the steamer basket.
 Arrange the green onions, ginger and garlic in the bottom.
 It should fit snugly but completely with the Dutch oven lid on. You will not need to use the top of the steamer basket.
 Add more if your Dutch oven is larger and you don’t think there is enough liquid to create steam for more than one hour. Keep the ratio the same.
 Once it is a roiling boil, reduce the heat to low.
 Then, allow it to simmer for about one hour.
 Then, make several slits in the breast. If the juices run clear, it is ready.
 Cover it in foil.
