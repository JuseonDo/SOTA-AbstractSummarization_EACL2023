 It is also known as the horse's "blind side". The horse doesn't kick mostly when you stand on the left side for saddling or patting a new horse.
 Whether it be on a saddle stand or a nearby fence, have it ready to be put straight on the horse so you do not have to make the horse wait any longer than necessary., Also make sure the top of the saddle pad is covering the horses withers. (Note: When saddling a horse English style, there may be two saddle pads. Put on the first one, and then the second.), You don't want more saddle pad on one side than the other!, The front of the saddle should be about 2 1/2 inches away from the front of the saddle pad. Make sure that the saddle in even on both sides of the horse and not lopsided., (If you are unfamiliar with the saddle, the billet straps are what the girth attaches to and they are located under the flaps on the side of the saddle.), Tighten accordingly making sure you can fit your hand above the girth. Do not tighten the girth too quickly because this tends to lead to a horse learning how to 'bloat' himself to make the girth loose when being saddled.,,
