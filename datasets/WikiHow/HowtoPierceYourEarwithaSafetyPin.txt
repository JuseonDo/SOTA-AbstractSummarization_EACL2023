 Remember whatever you put your pin down on will contaminate it, as will your fingers, so be careful.;
, This will be the most painful part of the the piercing process. Hold the ice to your ear for as long as you can stand, or at least say, 3-5 minutes.
,, The hardest thing here is keeping the pin straight so you get a straight hole. It's easy to end up with a piercing at an angle - so be careful. If you are piercing your upper ear or through cartilage, be prepared for a weird crunching sound as you break through. Wonky piercings are the most common problem from DIY jobs - so really - be careful! If you don't have the stomach to do it properly, take it out and get a professional to do it for you. You don't want weird sideways holes through your ears. Note in the picture the model has holes that slant upwards. Also you will want the closure of the pin to be at the front of the ear since this will the the easiest part of the pin for bacteria to collect and you will want to keep an eye on it.
 Remember not to double dip if using a container!

, Leave it alone, only twisting it once or twice a day and disinfecting it. Don't touch it with your grotty fingers all the time.
 This means if you put a stud or sleeper in straight away or after it has healed, it will be a lot less painful then if you DIY pierce with a needle.
