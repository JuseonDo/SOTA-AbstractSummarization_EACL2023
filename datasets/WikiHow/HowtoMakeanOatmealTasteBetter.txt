 Whether stove-top cooked or microwaveable, oatmeal is usually available in several flavors. For this particular recipe, try to stick with something that is sweet but not overly sweet-like Maple or Cinnamon flavored oatmeal.;
, Walnuts and almonds work well. It depends on your taste.
 Blackberries may be too sour-try blueberries or raspberries. This will add great nutrition to the oatmeal as well.
 Then, add them to the mix. This will make the oatmeal even look more appetizing and will enrapture you.
 Make sure the banana is ripe, it must be sweet. Add the pieces to the oatmeal.
 These can normally be purchased in small sizes. Sprinkling them onto the breakfast once will suffice.
