@summary
go on the first 50cc cup, and try to get the highest possible score.

@summary
if you get gold trophies on all of the cups, you unlock r.o.b.

 This might take a day or two.


For the first cup, use a car that focuses on speed, handling, and items. Once you have mastered these three things, you're basically ready to go.;
, Try out some more races with the character and the car on time trials.
 If you get a bad score on any race, which people will often do, don't restart, because you'll start in a bad place in the next race, and the game turns down the skill level when you start off in a bad place, and you get good items when you're in 6th, 7th or 8th place such as the Bullet Bill, a giant cannon which you hop onto and you don't have to touch your DS, because a giant rocket is streaming through the air, going the right way, and knocking people out its way. Even if you come in 3rd overall, it's a good start, and later on, try to improve that.


When you'd say you're an intermediate racer, you're ready to take on all the cups in 100cc and 150cc. But first complete 50cc.
 and you can use all of the karts with every character.
