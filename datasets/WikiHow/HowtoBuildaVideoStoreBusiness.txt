 You will need a building to rent or lease that is convenient for consumers. Most people will not go out of their way to a remote location. Business will be better if the location is easily accessible;
, Be certain to factor in utilities.
 Rent or lease one, once you find a prime location.
 Most video stores do well if they offer a wide selection of items. DVD, VHS, and Blu-Ray should all be an option. You may also want to consider renting video games such as those for PS3, Xbox and Wii.


Consider purchasing inventory from stores that are going out of business. Also look for shelving and other fixtures.
Get quotes from several suppliers and compare prices for inventory. You will need to find a supplier that offers up-to-date movies and games at the best price.
Offer consumers the option to rent gaming consoles and equipment.



Store memberships with discounted rates are one way to appeal to more people.
Standard video businesses rent per night. In addition to this method, rent movies and games by the week or for several days at a discounted rate.
Most stores offer specials or sales to draw in customers. Have weekday specials, old video sell-outs and other gimmick attractions such as "girls' night in" or "free child's rental with adult rental" specials.
 Reserve movies to purchase before they ever are released. New arrivals will be your best rentals.


Purchase several copies of movies that were hits at the box office.
 While you are putting money out, you are also drawing in another form of business.

Video store businesses must compete with each other as well as with online downloading and mail rentals.
Build your business by advertising and making people notice your store.
Specialize in a particular type of movie.
Keep new movies as well as older classics available.
Do not throw away all of your VHS. Most stores will only keep the latest movies and equipment.
Keeping a part of history alive may keep your business running.
