 Get dressed to play the air banjo like you think musicians would - think country attire. Leather boots and a large brimmed hat are always recommended.;
, Put on an album that has some real banjo music and play along. This will help develop a rhythm because you are dancing and strumming your fingers to the beat of an actual banjo song.
 Rock the neck of the banjo up and down constantly while playing. Keep in tune with the music, exaggerating you finger's movements when the music builds up and vice versa.

 Try spinning around on one foot during the banjo solo if the song has one. Lip sync the words if you know them.
