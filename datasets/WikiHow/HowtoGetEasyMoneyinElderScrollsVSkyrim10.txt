,, Sell to anybody willing to buy your stuff., If you own a house or have a secure location to keep your valuables, make a stash of items of significant value that you would be willing to sell. That way if you need money fast, you can grab some of those items and sell them to get money quickly., If you have money in your pocket, you are more likely to spend it than if it is resting comfortably in a chest in your house.
