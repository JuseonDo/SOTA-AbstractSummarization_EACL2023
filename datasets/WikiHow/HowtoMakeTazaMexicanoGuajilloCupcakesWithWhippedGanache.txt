,, Place a bowl with a lip wider than the saucepan over the steaming water. Add coarsely chopped Mexicano Guajillo to the bowl and stir gently until fully melted. Note that the Mexicano discs will not melt as smoothly as some other chocolates and may seem slightly grainy. Remove from heat and set aside, taking care not to allow any water to enter the bowl.
 Whisk in the masa harina or cornflour, cinnamon and chili powder, if using.
 Add the piloncillo or brown sugar, oil, vanilla extract and sea salt. Whisk vigorously for about one minute.
 Add melted Mexicano Guajillo to the batter and whisk until well combined. Scoop into a prepared cupcake pan or pour into prepared cake pan. For cupcakes, bake 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. For cake, bake 35-40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5-10 minutes before turning cake out of the pan or removing cupcakes. Allow cake to finish cooling completely before frosting with whipped ganache and sprinkling with cocoa nibs or chopped cacao bean.

, Stir in the agave syrup and vanilla and immediately pour over the chopped chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds. Add cinnamon and sea salt, stirring until mixture is smooth and consistent in color and texture. Scrape down sides as needed to fully incorporate all ingredients. Let stand at room temperature until mixture has thickened.
 Use frosting promptly or it will become stiff and hard to work with. If making ahead of time, the frosting can be stored and beaten until soft just prior to use.
