The Electric Flux through a surface A is equal to the dot product of the electric field and area vectors E and A.The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their respective magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.;
,

In most cases of this type, it is already given in the problem.


Note that the surface area vector is always perpendicular and outward from the surface.



The cosine of the angle between the two vectors multiplied by the electric field vector is equal to the component of electric field that is perpendicular to the surface area vector.



Electric flux is the product of Newtons per Coulomb (E) and meters squared.
Proper units for electric flux are Newtons meters squared per coulomb.
