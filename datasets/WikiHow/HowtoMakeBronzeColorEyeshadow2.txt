, They are often cheaper in stores that online, and most of them are plenty good quality.
 Don't test shades on your hand, test them on your eyes, because the 'perfect' shade may suit your skin, but not your eyes.
 If there's no testers, it's also an opportunity to assess the other qualities such as how long lasting it is, if it's waterproof etc, instead of just trying to find the perfect colour.
 Shopping online is a lot quicker and easier, and you'll spot things you didn't spot in the store.
 Search for/ go to all the different stores or brands, the cheap ones, the expensive ones. It doesn't occur to a lot of people that the perfect eyeshadow may be outside of their ideal store.
