 It may be the most uncomfortable thing ever but in the long run, it is helping you. The back brace is not meant to make your spine straight. It is only for pushing your spine as straight as possible while you are growing. That way, all your growth can go into your height, making you taller, not to your curves, making you shorter and hurting you.
 Think of it this way: when someone breaks their leg or twists their ankle, they wear a cast to help them. Even though they don't want to, they still wear it because it is for their own good. In a way, your back brace is doing the same thing., You are not the only one going through this. Think of the positive things. You get a whole new wardrobe. More clothes for your parents to buy and for a good reason., And it will all be because of your hard work and dedication. You will be proud at the end of it all and it's only temporary.,, Being in the brace is just as important as being out of the brace, so be ready to stretch when you are out to release the tension.
