 It's not as different as you're expecting. High school isn't some foreign place where everything you do is judged by the whole school. For the most part, what you do won't even be noticed. Sure, if you trip and drop your lunch tray you'll be embarrassed, but just laugh at yourself and ignore the stupid people in situations like that, and your good.;
, Now. Don't sit and wait for opportunities to come to you- be the one to go talk to people. Others aren't really all that different from you. In fact, in the beginning of the year people will be looking for friendships just as much as you will. Later in the year, however, it could get a little tougher. Groups of friends will start form, so it will seem more intimidating to just walk up and talk to them and start talking.
 The number one struggle with being social is always being totally paranoid and worried about what people think of you and always thinking of the worst case scenarios. So just chill out. They're thinking the exact same thing.
 If you're in a class or at lunch and there's an interesting discussion going, join in! Throw in a good point or even better a little humor! It'll make you seem confident and like an interesting guy (or girl) to be around.
 Seems stupid, but many people freak out when they start because they don't understand it, but it's very simple. Bell 1: go to class. Bell 2: You're late for class. Bell 3: go to your next class. Bell 4: You're late for class. Bell 5: go to your next class, etc.
 It's different in different schools, but most the time you just ask the teacher to use the hall pass, and you get a little plank that says hall pass on it. Some teachers will dock grade points for using it, and others give you a certain number of hall pass uses every quarter. Your teacher will explain all this on the first day of school, so don't worry about it.
 Again, there isn't some law of what you HAVE to do at lunch. Most people buy it from the cafeteria, which costs somewhere from $1.50 - $2.00. A lot of people bring sack lunches. Some who have cars even go out to eat if the school allows it (but make sure to be quick if you do this.) Some people walk around with their friends, some sit at the tables, lots of people even sit on the floors just for fun. It's really not a big deal- at all.
 Usually the teachers will tell you what they want you to have, so just have a backpack to put textbooks and papers in, a pen and pencil, and a notebook just in case. Bring a planner to write down all your assignments. The most common thing you hear when a teacher says to pass something in is, "Oh, crap."

, You should have gotten a schedule when you registered that tells all your classes and their room number, and on the first day there will be staff everywhere to help you out. You should also have a map of some sort somewhere; just relax, you'll figure it out.
 This is completely and totally without exception. Many people will remember you from their first impressions, and smelling bad with yucky teeth is not the way you want to go with that. If you can, always have deodorant with you. Cologne's always a good thing too.
 This will help you make friends faster and make people feel more comfortable around you. The classic moaning of, 'I'm tired," "I hate this class," "This teacher is so stupid" are no fun. It'll also make your teachers like you more which is always a plus. Don't take this too far though, or you'll just come off as a dork.
 After a day or two you'll have the whole thing down. Just remember to get out and talk to people NOW. It'll be awesome once you understand it all, so just take a deep breath, and relax.
