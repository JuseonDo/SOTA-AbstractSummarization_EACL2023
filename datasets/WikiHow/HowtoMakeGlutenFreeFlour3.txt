 Make sure that you are using potato starch and not potato flour. If you can't find any tapioca starch, however, you can use tapioca flour; it's the same thing.
 This is the secret ingredient that will help improve the structure of your gluten-free cakes, breads, cookies, muffins, etc. The added sugars will also create a browning reaction and lend your baked goods a more complex flavor., Don't get lazy on the mixing! If you don't mix things well enough, your baked goods will have poor results. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes of good mixing.
