 A spec (speculation) script does not contain any scene numbers or camera directions and very few cues for sounds or music. It usually undergoes considerable revision before the film is made.;
, It will include scene numbers, camera directions, and cues for sound effects and music. It may include scenes that were cut in post-production.
 A continuity script is one that was written after watching the movie, and it is formatted in a different manner from other scripts. These are usually the only kind of script still available for older movies.
 These are the revisions made by the writer at the request of the director or the studio to bring the spec script closer to the movie the studio wants to make. The later the draft, the closer the script is to the movie.
