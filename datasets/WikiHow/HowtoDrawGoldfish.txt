 Create a pointed egg shape as a rough guide for the whole body. Inside this, draw a small oval for the head, a large circle for the body, and a small curved triangle for the tail part (as shown in the illustration to the right).;
, Add a curved line for the mouth. Your fish at this point should look a little sad--if you'd rather have a cheerful fish, go ahead and draw the mouth curving upwards rather than downwards.
 Draw a quarter circle just a few spaces from the eyes. Put in a few more if you wish.
 The fins are fairly large in comparison to the body, taking up essentially half of the fish's total mass, so don't be afraid to go big or go home.
 These fins are small, so draw them with more reserve than the fins in step 4.
 They can be as large or as small as you want, or even differently shaped, but keep them within the lines of the body and spaced evenly.
 This will effectively add more life to the drawing. In fact, the more details you add, the better your fish will look, so use as many as you like.
 Donâ€™t mistake any of the scales or gills for extraneous lines!

, Goldfish are, of course, known for their bright orange coloring, but you can easily make yours into another kind of fish by changing the hues and patterns.
