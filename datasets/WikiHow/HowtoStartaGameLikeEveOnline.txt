 For the first few days, it can't be helped to feel being overwhelmed. Just stick with it, and be patient. Sooner or later you will get accustomed to the rules of space;
, Make use of this free time in understanding and exploring the game.
 In other online RPGs tutorials are dispensable; in Eve online they are mandatory. Eve online has a steep learning curve, made even steeper by skipping tutorials. As a bonus, you can gain a decent amount of money and get a better ship by doing the tutorial.
 Eve online has a different leveling structure. Learning skills are based on real-time, and not on experience gained or game-time like other online RPGs. Basically, you have to queue the skills you want to learn. These skills will finish learning even though you are not logged in, and doing other stuff such as work, sleep or school.
 Being a jack of trades is not advisable

, It can either be a trustworthy ally, a helpful Corporation or a friend. Getting help from an experienced player is invaluable especially during your early stages. It can save you a lot of time if someone teaches you, rather than figuring it out yourself.

 Maybe it will not happen today or tomorrow. But the truth is, it will eventually happen. It is simply the nature of the game.

 Only risk losing a ship if you can replace it at least five times over.
 If you're not having fun with the game, then you are stressed out or you're playing the game in a wrong way.
