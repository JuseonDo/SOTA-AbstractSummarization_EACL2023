@summary
sport a retro ponytail to the office, out for a picnic at the park, or for a daytime date for a playful, flirty look.

@summary
begin by parting your hair from ear to ear, tracing the top of your head to create a front section of hair that would cover your face if you let it fall.

@summary
tease the hair you did not just section off with a narrow-toothed comb starting at the crown of your head just back from the part you just created.

@summary
work your way down the back of your head, teasing about a three-inch section of hair from your part toward your neck.

@summary
pull all of the hair in the back section into a high ponytail, smoothing the underside with a smoothing brush as you go.

@summary
next, take your front section down and divide it into two smaller sections.

@summary
take one section of the front hair and sweep it back to your ponytail, creating a loose wave on the side of your head.

@summary
repeat for the second side.

@summary
spray your head with hair spray.

@summary

@summary
for a fancier feel, you can curl the hair in the ponytail with a curling iron.

@summary
add a wow factor to your ponytail by creating a swirl in the front of your head just above your forehead instead of the sweeping side pieces you created in steps 6 through 8.
@article
 You can dress it up for a nighttime feel by trying the different variations in steps 10 and 11.
 Swirl the hair into a little roll just above your forehead and clip it down using any clip you have handy. You'll use this section later on in the steps.
 Start about two inches up from the roots and back-comb your hair down to the roots, creating volume.
 Make sure to leave a small section of non-teased hair at the base of your head to smooth over the teased section.
 Secure the Ponytail with a hair tie as close to the root of the hair as possible.
 Create the part that you want in the front. It can either be a middle part or a side part.
 Drape the end of the section over the top of the hair tie and wrap it around the hair tie as many times as necessary for the length of your hair. Secure with a bobby pin underneath the Ponytail.
 Try to hide the bobby pins as much as possible. You may need to pin on top of the Ponytail as well, but be sure not to disturb the subtle swirl you created.
, If you choose to do so, refrain from using hair spray until after you have curled your hair.
 Before creating the Ponytail, section off about a three-inch wide section directly above your forehead.


Tease the section by back-combing it with a narrow toothed comb. Spray with hair spray as you go.
Use a smoothing comb to smooth down the fly-aways but make sure not to compromise the volume you created by teasing.
Make a loop at the end of the section and carefully roll it up on itself, down to the roots.
Finally, fasten the roll in place on top of your head directly above your forehead with bobby pins in the middle of the roll.
Spray with hair spray and then create your Ponytail.
