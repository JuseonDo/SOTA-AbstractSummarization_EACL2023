@summary
understand that real estate costs increase with each purchase of a particular type.

@summary
besides understanding that costs increase, you need to know that income for each stays the same.

@summary
to maximize your income, find the properties available that have the highest roi.

@summary
search online for 'imobsters calculator' to find examples.

@summary
either way, once you learn to buy your real estate using roi, you will see your income climb much faster than just buying random real estate.

@summary
after buying real estate, don't increase your levels as equipment upkeep keeps on increasing.

@summary
wait for about 10-15 days.

@summary
your balance will have become very large.

@summary
keep on repeating this method until you have enough cash.

 The increase is 10% of the original price, so, for example, your first Street Vendor will cost you $2000. Each subsequent purchase costs 10% more than 2000, or $200. So, the second costs you $2200, the third $2400, etc.;
, Income for your first Street Vendor gives you an additional $50. When you buy your next Street Vendor, it adds another $50 in income, etc.  What happens over time is something all players need to understand and that is Return on Investment or ROI. As real estate gets more expensive, it's ROI will drop, which we will demonstrate below. The formula for ROI is:


ROI = income / cost
For your first Street Vendor, the ROI = 50/2000 = 0.025
For your 10th Street Vendor, the ROI = 50/3800 = 0.013
This is nearly a drop in half of what the original ROI was. 

, To do this manually, calculate the ROI for each available piece of real estate and determine which one has the highest ROI and purchase it. Then do it again until you have spent all your available money. This can be very time consuming, so many players either create their own spreadsheets or use websites that have been already created.
 Then decide if one is right for you. Or, using the calculations and concept for ROI, you can create your own.
 Also, you will climb the leader-board of mob bosses, possibly becoming the Mafia Don!

, Instead, just be stable and let your income accumulate.
 It's a long time, but results are amazing. After this time, check your balance.
 Once this happens, invest again in Real Estate.
 Keep on upgrading your income.
