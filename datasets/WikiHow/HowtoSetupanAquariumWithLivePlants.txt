put a small plate or container lid on top of the gravel and pour water into the tank.

 It must be able to support the weight of the aquarium. Each gallon weighs about 8 lbs, so a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank with gravel and decor will be almost 100 lbs. Do not put the tank in direct sunlight, also don't place the tank where there is a lot of activity and the tank might get bumped or jiggled. This can put the fish or plants inside in danger!;
,, Layer it at least 1.5 thick.
 Do not use course gravel as this will make it hard for the plants roots to become established in the substrate.
 Only fill it about 1/4 to 1/3 full of water. Try to keep the water between 70–80 °F (21–27 °C). Very cold or very hot water will shock the plants and possibly kill them.
 If they are root bound use a toothpick to gently pull apart the roots and untangle them.
 Keep in mind positioning of the plant. Taller plants should be rooted in the background, and shorter plants should be rooted in the foreground. Do not place the plants too near the filter or the heater, because this will not be good for the plants.
 Some plants will die if you cover the crown of the plant so keep this in mind when planting.
 Again, keep the water temperature between 70–80 °F (21–27 °C).
,, The tank needs time to build up beneficial bacteria in the gravel and the filter pad. This beneficial bacteria stabilizes the tank and prevents ammonia and nitrate swings which are harmful to fish. Add onion or bumblebee snails to keep the algae level down. You can also use Flying Foxes or Otto Cats instead. Lighting should be given in accordance to the plants that you have.
