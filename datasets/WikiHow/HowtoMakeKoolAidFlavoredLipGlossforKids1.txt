 Place in the microwave . Heat on high to melt, for about 30 to 60 seconds.;
, In a bowl, mix in the drink powder to remove lumps.
 Don't put the lid on yet, for if you do so, it will take longer for it to set. Set aside.
 The setting time depends on how deep your container is. Check now and then by tipping the container to see whether it stops running and has solidified.
 Keep stored in a cool place, even in the refrigerator if it's hot indoors.
