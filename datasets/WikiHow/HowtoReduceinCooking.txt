 The larger the surface of the pan, the easier the reduction will be because there is more room for the water molecules to move around. The overall reduction will not take as long with a pan with a large surface area.;
,, Many recipes call for you to reduce the liquid by half. You do not have to know exactly; just use your best guess.
 If you are using a pan with a heavy bottom, you may be able to add more heat without scalding the sauce. The thicker metal keeps the pan's contents from burning too quickly.
, If it is high in sugar, it is best stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. If your reduction contains any meat drippings or products, it needs to be frozen and must be brought to a boil before using. Don't worry about thawing before bringing to a boil.
