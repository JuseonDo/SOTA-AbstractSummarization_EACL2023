go to the room that neville dwells in.

@summary
neville should be sitting in a rocking chair reading a book.

@summary
after you suck up all of his hp, a treasure chest will appear.
@article
 To get to this room, first go to the main room, The Foyer. Go up the stairs and go left. His room is the first door to Luigi's right. You must have the key in order to do this.;
, When he yawns, he will expose his heart. This is the time to start sucking him in through your Poltergeist 3000. Neville has 100 HP, as many other ghosts do.
 Open it to receive a key to Lydia's room.
