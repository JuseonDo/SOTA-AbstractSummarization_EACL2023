stop thinking that "debt is the normal way of thinking.",

@summary
think about using "other people's money" (opm), only if it will be paid by someone else, which means paid by profits or positive cash flow, example business or rental property.

 So how, exactly, do you live without a car payment?;
, Buy a cheap $2,000 car just to get around for about a year. 12 months @ $475—using the average car payment—save it every month, and pay for a newer car (with the cash!), instead of giving it to the new car payment.


Pay cash for a better car. You see that after 10 months of doing that, you'd have $4,750 to use for that newer car, and two more months is another $950. Also use the $1,500–2,000 you can get for your old beat up car, and you have about $7,000.
