 Here's Bella's room in the movie "Twilight": Light green walls, bright blue translucent curtains, twin-sized bed with purple bedding, a cork/bulletin board, an oak desk, an oak dresser, and various strings of white lights hung about the walls. In a nutshell, Bella's movie bedroom is very different from the one mentioned in the book.
,, Again, it does not matter what size bed you have, as long as you have some purple bedding. The exact bedding used for the movies is either sold out or discontinued but you may be able to find the charcoal colored version of the bedding used in the movie. However, any purple flowery bedding will work and keep your eyes peeled for bedding that looks similar to Bella's.


Look on trading and auction sites for old bedding being sold in used but great condition.
 This will allow you to add your awards, pictures, magazine/newspaper clippings, ribbons, etc. Anything that means a lot to you and is shown on paper should be pinned up here for a nice accent to your room.
 Bella's desk is large and oak. She has a black Apple Macbook laptop, as well as an old-style lamp. Macbooks can be very expensive if you are looking for a modern style, so check out other retailers and computer companies for a cheaper laptop if you'd like!

, In the movies Bella has white lace curtains with light blue sheer curtains as well. The colors are perfect considering that blue is one of Bella's favorite colors.
 These extra lights will make your room look great!
