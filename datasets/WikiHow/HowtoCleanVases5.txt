 This step is less likely to work on very hard stains, therefore loosening is very important to do beforehand., Crush about four with a spoon or fork in a bowl to sizes slightly smaller than an inch., Add one or two tablespoons depending on size., Check regularly to see if the stains have started to go away. Be sure to dispose of all eggshells before using the vase again.
