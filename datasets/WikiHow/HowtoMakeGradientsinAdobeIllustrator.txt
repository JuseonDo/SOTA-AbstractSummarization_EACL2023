 Go to File > New (or Ctrl + N), and set the size of the document to a vertical-letter sized canvas. Add guides by creating a rectangle using the rectangle tool (W:8.5in, H:11in). Then drag the guides onto each center of the bounding box. Finish by right clicking over your ruler to change your document measurements to pixels.;
, Create the shapes by following these measurements: Square: Width=25px, Height=25px ; Rounded Square: Width=25px, Height=25px, Corner Radius=5px ; Circle: Width=25px, Height=25px ; Polygon: Radius=15px, Sides=6 ; Star: Radius 1=15px, Radius 2=7px, Points=5px.


Make sure the shape’s fills are set to white and their stroke to black.
 You can do this by clicking on your swatches and then clicking the upper right corner of your gradient panel in your panel menu. When the dialog box appears, simply click on new swatch and then okay.
 Set the colors to the following combinations: Lilac: C=50, M=53, Y=0, K=0 ; Green: C=80.57, M=3.08, Y=83.71, K=0.08.
, On the gradient panel, drag the lilac swatch to the color stop in order to change the black color. Then select the square and click on the gradient fill box. To change the direction of the gradient, click “G” on your keyboard, hold down the shift key and drag your pointer upward. A gradient of white-to-lilac will appear on the square.
 Select your rounded square and click again your gradient fill box. Once again change the direction of the gradient from green to lilac.
 Select the circle and click again the gradient fill box, change again also the direction of the gradient from green, white to lilac.
 Then change the type of gradient from linear to radial. Next, select the polygon shape and click the gradient fill box.
 Select the star shape and click the gradient fill box.


You now have different kinds of shapes with different kinds and blends of gradients.
