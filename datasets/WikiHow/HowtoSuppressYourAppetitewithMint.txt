 The scent of mint acts as an appetite suppressant.;
, It will give your body a temporary fill-up. It's also good for you! Stick with plain water, or add some mint flavor to it for that bonus appetite suppressant.
 Not only will the mint scent/taste help suppress your appetite, but simply chewing gum can help reduce cravings.
, The calories are negligible (unless you eat them in volume) and the mint flavor can help tide you over to the next meal.
 Again the mint will help, plus getting any other food flavors out of your mouth will help. And since most people brush their teeth after eating, we associate that "just-brushed" feeling with feeling full.
