 Uzbekistan was once known as a country with the worst telephone connection. It is much better now, but it is still very expensive.;

If you call a home or office phone, dial the city code. That means that if you are calling to Tashkent (with a code of 971) you should dial 998971.
If you are calling to a cell phone, find out the mobile phone company. For example, the Perfectum Mobile code would be 90, but the MTS code is 98. Enter the mobile or city phone code right after the country code. For example, for Perfectum Mobile, dial 99890. For MTS, dial 99898.
