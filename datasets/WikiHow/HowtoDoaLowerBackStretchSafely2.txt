This stretch is great for people who already have lower back pain. It stretches the lower back along with supporting muscles in the hips and glutes.
 Grasp the leg with both hands under the knee. Gently pull the leg in towards your body.









You should feel a gentle stretch in your lower back, glute, and or hip. The lower back is a complex structure comprised of many intertwined muscles and nerves - improving hip and glute flexibility can have a positive effect on back pain.
 Keep your other leg in a comfortable position - usually against the floor, either straight or bent at the knee.


To add hip-flexing element to the stretch, use your hands to rotate your leg by gently pulling your shin across your body.
 Repeat 2-3 times per leg for a thorough, even stretch.
