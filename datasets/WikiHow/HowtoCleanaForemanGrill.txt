 That means that the grill will still be extremely hot.;
, Don’t soak them but make sure they are damp enough to get the grill surface wet.


Don’t add soap or any other cleaning chemical.
 Press down (like you are actually cooking the paper towels) and allow the towels to steam between the grates.


Hold in place a few seconds, allowing the water to steam the grates, lifting debris off the grill.
 Take care during this step to avoid getting burned.


Discard paper towels.
 You may want to wait a few seconds to allow the grill to cool completely before drying.
