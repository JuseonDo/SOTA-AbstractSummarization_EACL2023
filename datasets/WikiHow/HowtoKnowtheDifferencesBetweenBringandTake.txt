 An easy distinction between take and bring, is when you compare them in terms of the speaker's perspective. "Take" associates with "going" from the speaker's perspective and "bring" associates with "coming." in the speaker's perspective. For example, if two people are standing together and one says "I'm taking this to John," he is going to John.;
, Someone else brings something to where the speaker is currently, and takes something to where he plans to go in the future. For example:


"I am taking a book to school tomorrow." The speaker is at home, and she wants to carry the book to another place (in the future).
"I will bring my mother's journal tomorrow." The speaker is at school, and is talking to a teacher about bringing the journal to where she is now (the current location).
"Can you bring a bottle of wine when you come over?" The speaker is asking the listener to bring wine to where the speaker is now. The listener would then reply "sure, I will bring a bottle of wine with me," because the listener is not there yet.



"Bring the form 'here' to me to sign, then you can take it 'there' to the manager's office. The manager can take it to the courthouse with the other forms." follows the same pattern.
