 This seed puts you near a village at the foot of an impressive mountain. Start to climb the mountain and you'll eventually find an interesting network of ravines, canyons and caves. Channel your inner Indiana Jones and start exploring!

, This seed has you start out in a fairly standard village. Once you gather some resources, however, you'll be able to make the journey across the water to a nearby mushroom biome. In addition, there is temple near a second village in the opposite direction.
 Be careful with this seed â€” you start next to not one, but two different mob spawners in the middle of a desert. Luckily, you're not completely trapped: there are hills nearby you can escape into, plus a town with a blacksmith.
