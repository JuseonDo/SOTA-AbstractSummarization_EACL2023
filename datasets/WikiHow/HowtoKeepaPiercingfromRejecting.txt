 Check their portfolios for healed piercings in addition to fresh ones. Ask about their experience and qualifications.;
, Eyebrows, navels, lip frenulums, some genital piercings, and surface piercings all have a higher risk of rejection. Piercings through cartilage have a very low risk.
 Piercings that travel through a lot of flesh, like a rook or tragus, should be done with a straight or slightly curved barbell. Surface piercings should be done with surface bars. Navels and eyebrows need curved barbells, or surface bars. Most piercers agree that titanium or glass is less likely to reject than steel, because your body accepts it more easily.
 Most piercers use 14 or 16 gauge as the standard, smaller gauges are more likely to reject. Choose the largest gauge that is suitable. Many piercers believe certain places, like tongues and inner labia, do best with 12g or larger.
, To make a sea salt soak use non iodized sea salt that can be purchased at any drug or grocery. Use 1/4 - 1/8th teaspoon salt to 8 oz of warm distilled or bottled water. Using more salt can cause irritation to your piercing. Don't bump or hit your piercing, and keep hair products and tight clothing away from it.
, See a qualified piercer to remove jewelry. Removing jewelry from an infected site can seal the infection inside the skin, causing cyst.
