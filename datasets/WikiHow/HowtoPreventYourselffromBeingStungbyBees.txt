 Sugary drinks and fruits attract bees. Try to bring foods with low sugar content in an area were you think there may be bees. Cola and other types of sugar-syrup drinks will attract bees. If you're not sure whether the drink you have is alright, stick to water.;
, Some scents will attract bees and force you into contact with them.
 The more you're covered, the less able they are to sting you. Saturated colors have less of a chance of attracting them.
 Some types of bees burrow in the ground rather than the trees. When vibrations occur near the nesting, they can be disturbed and attack the most nearby animal, or come straight up and sting the soles of your feet.
 Use precautions when mowing or removing vegetation or doing any type of yard work. If you find any nests, have them removed by a professional.
 Old cans, leftovers, or any type of garbage will most likely attract bees. If you're able to, remove the objects away from where you'll be.
 Do not try to swat or hit the bees or it may lead to being stung. If you're stung anyway, cover your nose and mouth and leave the area. When a bee has stung, it releases a chemical to attract more bees to the area. Evacuate to a closed structure like a car or building.
