 Facebook does not support deleting multiple friends at once, so you'll need to use a browser extension to mass delete. The extension Friend Remover PRO for Chrome is the most functional of the options. This extension will not have access to your Facebook login email or password.


It is not possible to do this from a mobile device. You must use the desktop version of Chrome that supports browser extensions.;
,


You can also click ⋮ → More tools → Extensions.
,,,, This will install the extension.
 Make sure to close all windows and tabs.
 You'll see the Friend Remover PRO icon to the right of the address bar.
, You do not need to give Friend Remover PRO your Facebook login details, just log into the Facebook website like you normally would.
 This will open your profile page.
 You'll find this beneath your cover image.
 This will open a new tab with the Friend Remover PRO interface.
 This can take a while if you have several hundred or more friends.
 This will highlight the person.


You can type a search term into the "Filter friends" field. This can help you find specific friends quickly.
 You'll see a summary of all of the friends you'll be deleting.
 All of the selected friends will be permanently deleted from your Facebook friends list. This may take a while to process for large numbers.
