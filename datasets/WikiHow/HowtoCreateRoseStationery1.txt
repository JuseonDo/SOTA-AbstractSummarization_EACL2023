 The base of this crunchy veggie will become a blossoming rose when cut just right. Buy said salad vegetable.;
, The size of your radicchio may end up dictating the size of the stationery. A larger vegetable may mean that you go for the larger notecards. Or you may want to only stamp the front of the envelope.


Select stationery that is heavy and can withstand an ink stamp. You don’t want the ink to bleed through to the back of the paper either.
 Pink or red may be the obvious choice for your rose, however you can get creative by selecting a variety of colors. Make sure your veggie base fits completely inside the ink pad so the entire bottom can be inked.


Choose ink that can be painted on the vegetable bottom if you can’t find a pad that fits the bill.
