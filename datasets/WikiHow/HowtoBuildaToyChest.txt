@summary
cut the mdf or plywood down to size using a circular saw.

@summary
begin assembly by putting glue along the front and back edges of the bottom piece.

@summary
,

@summary
clamp each piece with 2, 24-inch (70 cm) bar clamps to hold the pieces in place while you screw them together.

@summary
,

@summary
apply glue to each side and the bottom of the 2 end pieces.

@summary

@summary
slide these into place using the clamps to hold them while screwing the front, back and bottom to the ends.

@summary

@summary
wipe all off the glue that has squeezed out from the joints with a soft cloth.

@summary
,

@summary
make sure you sink all of the screw heads below the surface of the panels.

@summary
round off, or ease, all sharp exposed corners while sanding gently.

@summary
paint the exterior and interior of the box, as well as the lid and bottom with the color of paint you chose.

@summary
attach the top to the toy chest using a 30-inch (76.2 cm) piano hinge centered on the lid's back edge.

@summary
connect casters on swivels at each corner to make the toy chest easy to move when it's loaded.

@article
 Make note of the shape and size of the chest you want to build. Include the hardware and a cutting list for the parts to the toy chest on the sketch.;
,

The materials list will be 3/4-inch (19 mm) MDF or plywood, applicable hinges, and (if using MDF #8 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) MDF) torx flat head screws or (for plywood) 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) deck screws.






Have the home improvement store use their panel saw to cut the sheet down to the approximate sizes you need for the top, bottom, front, back and ends.
,


This will be 2 pieces of 18 x 36 inches (45.7 x 91.44 cm) for the front and back.






You need 1 piece of 16.5 x 34.5 inches (41.9 x 87.6 cm) for the bottom.






A single piece of 19 x 37 inches (48.3 x 94 cm) will be for the top.






The ends will be made from 2 pieces cut to 17.25 X 16.5 inches (44.5 X 41.9 cm).






Mark the pieces lightly with a pencil as you cut them to show where each part goes.
,,,,,


Fill all the countersunk screw holes and joints with paintable wood putty.






Sand down the toy box after drying, readying it for paint.
 Start with 120 grit and finish with 240 grit sandpaper.
 Follow manufacturer's recommendations.



Make certain the hinge is flush to the back of the box.
It also needs to be centered so that it is 1/2 inch (13 mm) off each side of the box, corresponding to the each end of the top.
An easy way to center the hinge is to mark the center of the hinge on top and back of the box. The center would be 15 inches for a 30-inch (76.2 cm) piano hinge. Then mark the center on the lid and back of the box. Align the marks and attach the hinge.
This should give you a 1-inch (26 cm) lip at the front to make it easy to open.
