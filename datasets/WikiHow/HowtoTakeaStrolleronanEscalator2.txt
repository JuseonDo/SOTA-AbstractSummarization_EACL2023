 Lift your child out to be carried.








This maneuver only works if you have another adult with you.
 Make sure all the straps are tucked inside the folds and not dangling. Also, carry bags in the same hand as a stroller if possible, so you have a hand to grab the rail.
 Try holding it with one hand only so you have a hand to hold on to the handrail. Balance it on one step if possible, pulling it behind you.








If you need to balance it on more than one step, push it in front of you. Be sure to lift the wheels over the comb-plate.
 Also, be sure to hold onto the handrail while carrying your child. Stand in the middle of the escalator, and make sure the kid doesn't stick his or her hands out, as they can get caught.
 At the end, make sure you lift the wheels over the comb-plate to make exiting easier.
 Once you exit the escalator, unfold the stroller, and place your child back in the stroller.
