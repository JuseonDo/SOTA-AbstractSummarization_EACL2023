 Your calves don't need over a day's worth of rest. Every day, work out your calves by walking, jumping or running.;
, Your thighs get sore easy and need 2+ days to heal after a workout. As such, don't make working out your thighs a daily thing.
 Your abs help a lot with endurance and if your abs aren't worked out, your side or stomach or side may start hurting when you're running.
, Before you start training, do some stretching.
, By regularly running one more lap than necessary, when the time comes to run your four laps, it will be easier and your time will improve.
, Interval training is a great way to prepare and train for the mile.
 Don't run it as fast as you can, but run it at your time you need for one lap. say you are trying to run a 5 minute mile, you would need to run at least 75 seconds per lap to do just that. Try to run at that pace so you try to do that on your five laps next time.
 For a cool down you can run an easy jog a lap or walk 1/2 a lap.
 By taking deep breaths, your back remains a little straighter.
 Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Doing this can help you to maintain your energy.


Try putting your hands on your head after you run or do a workout. This opens your lungs and helps you to breathe better.
 At the end of your mile when you want to run your "kick", pull your elbows back. This has the power to help you to go faster.
 When you are actually running the mile, you don't look at your opponents, behind you, below or to the side of you. Train yourself at all times to look ahead.
