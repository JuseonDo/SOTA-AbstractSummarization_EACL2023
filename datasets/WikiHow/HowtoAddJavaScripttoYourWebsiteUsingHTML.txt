alert("Hi there, and welcome.")
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>




, Add it a src (stands for "src") property to the script tag and include the complete web address of the file. Make sure to link directly to the Javascript file and not the page's URL where the script is being called from by the other page's creator.





<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http:

</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>




, Following the </body> tag, include the </html> tag.
