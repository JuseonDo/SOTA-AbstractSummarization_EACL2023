 Changing the color is helpful. Each outfit you buy should have its own theme. if your theme is mix and matching, go for it!

, That's most recommended. If you're VIP, choose the 200 SC ones. Just don't choose the cat eyes at the salon, or the cartoon eyes in the beginning.
 Any of them are super stylish and cute; choose the one you think looks best.
 Try the ones that don't have any teeth showing. Try a light peach or pink for the lips.
 Nobody likes unnatural skin color, such as: green, pink, blue etc. Skin color doesn't matter much.
 It's a waste of money since you can go shopping anytime and they have accessories like the eyewear.
