stretching: before you engage in any activity/sport, e.g.

@summary
get into position: stand upright, feet shoulder-width apart, and face the basket.

@summary
shooting hand/arm positioning: hold the ball in your shooting hand.

@summary
off-hand positioning: place your off-hand on the side of the ball; the thumb of that hand pointed toward the centre of your forehead.

@summary
performing the set-shot: extend your arm with force, and when it is fully extended, flick your wrist to create backspin.

 basketball, you should stretch to ensure that you do not strain any muscles during the exercise.;
, Bend your knees so that they are 45Â° from their original position and lean back slightly.
 Your forearm should be vertically positioned; your elbow bent in an acute angle. Your fingertips should be facing you and your hand should be facing upward, in line with your eyes. Only hold the ball with your fingertips, making flicking your wrist much easier.
 Your off-hand guides the ball and supports your shooting hand.
 Your off-hand should remain in its position. As you extend your arm, straighten your knees, lift onto your toes and then balance on them. Straightening your knees from a bent position provides your arm with pressure, therefore you do not need as much force from your arm to shoot. This should all be done simultaneously and with speed.
