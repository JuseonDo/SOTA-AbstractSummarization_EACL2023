 Fold it in half. You can use colored or white paper â€” it doesn't matter.
 Other designs, such as hearts, can work too. Cut these shapes out. Inside, draw some balloons or flowers under the holes on the right side. When you look at the closed card, you should see the color of the design underneath.
, You can also add fancy decorations like glitter, rhinestones, etc. if you have them.
 Sprinkle with gold glitter for a "glowing" effect! Let it dry for a few minutes. When it's done, you'll have a beautiful birthday card!
