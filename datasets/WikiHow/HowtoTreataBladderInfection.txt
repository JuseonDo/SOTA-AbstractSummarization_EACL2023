 Doctors prescribe a variety of antibiotics for bladder infections including amoxicillin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin.


Your doctor may place you on a short regimen of antibiotics or on a longer regimen depending on the severity of the infection.
Take all of your medication even if your symptoms disappear. Doing this will help ensure that the infection is completely eradicated. If you don't take all of your medication, you run the risk of getting a more serious infection.;
, Analgesics help to numb your bladder and urethra to lessen pain that you may feel when urinating.
 Cranberry juice may have infection-fighting properties to relieve your bladder infection. Just make sure to count your calories, and stop drinking the juice if you experience stomach discomfort or diarrhea.
 Drinking large quantities of water will help to dilute your urine and to flush bacteria from your urinary tract.
 Skip alcohol, caffeine and citrus juices until your infection clears up.
 Apply a warm heating pad to your abdomen to ease bladder discomfort.
, Douches, deodorant sprays and powders can all irritate your urinary tract.
 Some doctors believe that tampons make bladder infections more likely. Change the pad every time you go to the bathroom.
 Also, drink a glass of water to help flush your urinary tract.
 Doing this will keep you from dragging rectal germs toward your urethra.
 Emptying your bladder frequently will prevent bacterial growth.
 Sitting in a tub filled with bubbles or with excessive soap or shampoo suds can wash away your urethra's protective mucus layer and invite infection.
 Tight pants or underwear may irritate your urethra. Cotton underwear is the best choice if you have frequent bladder infections.
