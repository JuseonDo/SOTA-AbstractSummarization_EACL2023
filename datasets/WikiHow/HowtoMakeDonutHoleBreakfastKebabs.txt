 For each kebab, you'll need approximately 3 donut holes, 3 large strawberries and 3 blackberries, give or take a few.
 The spray will prevent the ingredients from sticking to the skewer and allows for easy release.
 String 1 donut hole, 1 strawberry, followed by 1 blackberry onto the skewer. Repeat this step until the entire skewer has been filled. Repeat until all of the kebabs you'd like to make are completed.
 Pile the completed skewers onto the prepared platter, in readiness for dipping.
 Pour the salted caramel and chocolate sauces into individual small bowls.
, Diners can help themselves to a skewer and dip as pleased.,
