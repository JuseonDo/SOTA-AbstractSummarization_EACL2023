 If they are truly non-believers, then you can try your best to prove that spirits exist. If it doesn't really matter to them, then this shouldn't be a problem.
 It may not do anything, depending on how skeptical they already are, but they may be willing to try.
 Your persistence and refusal to accept them as they are will only push them away.
 Neither of you is obligated to change your beliefs, but it doesn't hurt to see things from a new perspective. Just as believing in spirits may be essential to you, having a clear sense of what they believe in could be just as important to them.
