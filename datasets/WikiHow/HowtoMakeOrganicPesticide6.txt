 Chrysanthemums contain a chemical component called pyrethrum, which is capable of paralyzing many garden insects.
 Boiling the mixture releases the pyrethrum into the water.
 Remove the dried flowers and save the infused water.
 Focus on the most damaged areas before moving onto less damaged areas. Cover the entire plant, including the undersides of leaves.
 After that period, it may no longer be effective.
