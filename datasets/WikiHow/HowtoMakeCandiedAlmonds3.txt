 Whisk this mixture together to break up any clumps and make sure that it is all blended evenly

, The egg white will create a light, solid coating for the sugar to bind onto the almonds. Get this mixture nice and frothy by rapidly whisking it until bubbles form

, Toss the almonds in the egg and vanilla briefly to coat them, then add everything to the large sugar mixture. Again, toss and mix up everything so the almonds are uniformly coated in sugar., Cover the pot and let the almonds cook for 3 hours, stirring regularly.


Try to stir the almonds every 20 minutes or so to keep them all well coated.
 The water will help the sugar crystalize, giving you the wonderfully crispy exterior you want., Once the almonds have a crunchy, crispy sugar coating, remove them and break up any large chunks. Let them cook on a baking sheet and serve either warm or room-temperature.
