 It is no longer needed! If you leave it on, you'll get a papery mess in the water.;
, Put the holes on opposite sides. Do not skip this step. Without these holes, the can may bulge and there is the danger of it exploding.
 You will need to add more water during the cooking process to make sure water doesn't go below this level as it evaporates. Don't let the water come higher than 1/2 inch (1.25cm) from the top of can, though, as you don't want any getting on the top of the can and going into the holes you pierced.


To prevent the can from rattling in the water (which can be annoying when you consider that it'll need to be in there for several hours) put a rag under the can.
,, Some of the condensed milk might escape through the holes. If this happens, scoop it off with a spoon. Try not to let any spill over into the water.
 How long you wait depends on the type of dulce de leche you want.


A soft Dulce de leche takes about three hours.
A firm Dulce de leche will take up to four hours.
 Be careful when emptying the contents, as you can get burned.
 The top will be more fluid, and there will be thicker, darker chunks at the bottom which will need to be scraped out. When everything is in the bowl, whisk together to make it homogeneous.
