 (Mixing baking soda with dirt won't be very effective). You want to start with a carpet that's as clean as possible. Vacuum your carpet to pick up any of the big particles of dirt or loose fibers. The bottom of your shoes contains oil and dirt and the constant contact with your carpet can grind away the surface of your carpet and leave dirt deep in the fibers.;
,,, Plan to use up at least one, and maybe two, boxes of baking soda. You want to completely cover your carpet so you can hardly tell what color it is. Since baking soda is not harmful to humans or pets, don't skimp.
 This will help you distribute it more evenly.
 A fresh, unopened box will be able to absorb more smells.
 Use a dry scrub brush or sponge to scrub the baking soda deep into the fibers of the carpet, so it gets all the way to the bottom. This is especially necessary if your carpet is shaggy and long; you want to make sure every part gets coated with soda.
,, If you can let it sit for 24 hours, that's even better. The longer it sits, the better your results will be. Baking soda naturally neutralizes and absorbs odors rather than covering them up.
, It won't work unless it's actually touching the parts of the carpet that smell.
 Work slowly, since that much baking soda is going to take awhile to vacuum up. You'll need to go over each section of the carpet several times to get the job done.As long as it didn't get wet, the baking soda should come right up.
