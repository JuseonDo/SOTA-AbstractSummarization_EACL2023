There are 6 screws in this step, one of them is tying the center piece to ground cable.
After unscrew all of them and disconnecting the data cable, lift the center piece up and flip it over. (You can disconnect the thumb key if you like)

, Led should just fall off right away
Before putting the new led in, make sure the polarity is correct (use multimeter or just touch the terminal with led pins).
Put the led in the slot and solder them (make sure the gap between led and button is tight, you can just put a piece of tissue paper under the board to push the led towards the board)

Desolder old ones, put the new one in. You can just melt both solder simultaneously then throw the led on it. Also, don't forget the polarity first!
