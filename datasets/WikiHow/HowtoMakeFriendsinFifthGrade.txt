@article
 Be polite and smile when you talk to others, if you are rude nobody will want to be around you. Much less your friend. Nod, and smile when you pass your classmates in the hall.;
, For instance a sport that you both play, or a hobby. While it can be scary just to walk up to somebody, it will be worth it. Begin to have small conversations with your classmates, chances are one of them will start talking to you more too.
 Play kickball, wall ball, soccer, tetherball, or another popular game, it's a great way to get to know names and peers.
 If they include you in their conversations great! If not, you might not even want to be friends with them. You could try to get into their conversation but you don't want to seem like an eavesdropper.
