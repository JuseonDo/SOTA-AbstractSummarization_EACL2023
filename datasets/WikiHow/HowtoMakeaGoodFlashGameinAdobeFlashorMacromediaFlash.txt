, Try copying pictures from the internet first then try making your own pictures. This will mean that when you start making your game the art will be near first class. If you can't draw at all team up with someone who can draw extremely well.
 This will help you for mini movies in the game

, Search around Google, Bing or youtube.
 Make all the changes to it now, as once you start making it, you have to stick with the storyboard or your game's topics are going to be messed up.
 Use inspiration from other games and stuff. Remember to stick with the storyboard!

, This means nobody can pass your game off as theirs. They can be either at the start or finish of your game.
 Edit them to what you need and what files you need made, press ok and go into file, Publish. Wait a few seconds and your first flash game will be made.
