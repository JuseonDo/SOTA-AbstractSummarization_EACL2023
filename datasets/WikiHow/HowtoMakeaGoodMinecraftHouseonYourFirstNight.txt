 A good seed for this build is in a forest, next to a lake.
, This is where the river/lake is needed. Gather 6 sand, make a furnace and start smelting the sand while you continue the build.

If you want extra effect, collect some clay from the riverbed. This will be used for a flower pot or 2 later.
 Next, jump on top of the box and place a slab on the planks then extend the slabs around the box., Fill the floor of the box in with birch planks. Then place an oak door in the hole., Make those glass you smelted into panes and fill the 2 wide hole with them. Then make a hole on the back right corner, 3 long 1 wide 1 high so you can see through the corner into the room. Fill the space with panes., On the front extend the slabs to the end of the window and go 2 blocks back on the left side., Then just make any tweaks you feel necessary to the exterior, but don't detail just yet.,,, The house is done!
