 In Massachusetts, you must be at least sixteen years old and a Massachusetts resident when you apply for a learner's permit.;
, A copy is available at most RMV branches for $5. You must pass a written test to earn your permit. It is based on the Driver's Manual, so make sure you study it. You can also view the official Driver's Manual online.
 Try to arrive at least half an hour to 45 minutes before the Registry stops permit testing. Be patient and alert for your turn.
 Be sure to check that you are applying for a learner's permit, and that you want either a class D or a class M permit.
 Present the required documents for your application. Pay the $30 test fee, take a vision test, and have your picture taken.
 Most of the time, the test is taken on a touchscreen kiosk. Basic rules of the road and driving skills are common questions. Answer 18 out of 25 questions correctly in order to pass.
 If you passed the test, you will receive your permit here.
