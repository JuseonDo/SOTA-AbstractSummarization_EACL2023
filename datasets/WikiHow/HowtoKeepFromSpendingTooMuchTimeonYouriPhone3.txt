@summary
have your child, or spouse create a password for parental controls so you don't have more than 2 hours a day to be on it.

@summary
if you don't comply and you run out of time before you get home from work, then have them shorten the time by 10 minutes every week.
@article
 Have them write down the password and keep it in a safe place where you DON'T know where it is.
 Until you are under the time, it will shorten and will stop as late as 15 minutes per day. After a week of perfect under the time, you can recover 15 minutes. This will stop at 2 hours. Then after 2 weeks, will go up one hour. Your goal is to stay under 2 hours with the hour wiggle room. After 2-4 months of having a close to perfect record, (1-3 times) you can get rid of the parental controls for good. This should keep you under 2 hours of phone time now.
