 Process until the ingredients are combined but not too much.;
,, Reserve the egg white. Add one whole egg and the extra egg yolk to the processor. Process quickly.
 Wash your hands and prepare to roll the sausages.
 This is best done on a non-stick surface such as baking paper or greaseproof paper laid over a wooden board. Adjust until you are happy with the shapes.
 Roll each sausage in the whisked egg white. Follow by rolling in the flour to coat.
 Cook the sausages in the oil until browned. Attend to them at all times, turning regularly.
 These are best served immediately with a suitable sauce or a gravy. Fried onion pieces are also an ideal addition and mashed potatoes.
