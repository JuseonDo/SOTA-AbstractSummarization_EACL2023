 The ideal points to shift the car into neutral and then into the higher or lower gear varies depending on the car, but the main method is the same. The main thing to remember is that you have to find the right RPM to shift into the next gear.
, When the RPMs get low enough (around 1500-2000), it should go into gear easily.
 It takes time to find the right time to shift in your car.
