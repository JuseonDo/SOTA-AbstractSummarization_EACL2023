when you get a good starter, get a large glass, glazed ceramic, or plastic bowl, and with a wooden or plastic (non-metal) spoon, mix 2 cups of water with enough flour to make a gooey mix.

check your sourdough daily.

add more water if necessary to make it a good consistency for pancakes.

 If it's too stiff to stir easily, add more water. Then stir in a tablespoon or more of your sourdough starter (adding all of it is OK too). Leave this in a warm but not hot place.
 When it smells good and sour, and gets more gooey in consistency, you're ready. This will happen overnight in warm areas, and it takes up to 3 days in a cold house.
 If you've never made pancakes before, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it after a few tries and you can't really go wrong.
