 The kanji for "Kurenai" can also be read as "beni" which is a word used for red makeup used traditionally in Japan to color the lips red. The red she wears is somewhat dark, so look for darker shades. For the eye makeup, you should can wear lavender eyeshadow and apply black/dark mascara with thin, dark eyeliner. For the face, try to apply a thin layer of usually light colored foundation, and use cover-up for blemishes/scars.;
, (Or, if on a really small budget, just wear a regular headband, preferably a dark blue.) Be sure to wear it covering most (but not all) of your forehead. That's just the style. The "bangs" should go over the headband.
 Bangs should be grown out, and parted in the middle. They should also stick up over the headband, and then fall flat. (See photos of Kurenai for reference)

, If you really want to act like her, you also have to keep up with your personal hygiene.
 Wigs should be styled slightly wavy in certain spots, with curls at the ends of strands.
 Athletic tape can work well. Or just you can just wear a really long or tight wrist band if you want to give it that Kurenai touch.
