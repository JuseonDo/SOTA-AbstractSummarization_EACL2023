 You are welcome to use other colors, but white works best for snowmen.


Avoid using ankle socks, they won't work.;
, You may need to adjust this later. When the sock is filled, tamp the sock to compact the rice.
, This creates the bottom section of the snowman. Repeat to create a slightly smaller middle section of snowman.
 Leave 4-5 inches (10-12.5cm) of space on the top.
 Make sure the sock snowman can "stand". Shape the head on three quarters with your hand.
, Use the tip of the sock which you previously cut off to make the cap. To color the snowman, you can use pen and chalk., Glue buttons on the snowman using a hot glue gun. Use one type of buttons for the eyes and other buttons for the "shirt" down the front of the snowman.
 Use a permanent marker to draw a mouth of the snowman or cut out a piece of felt to glue on as a mouth.
 Try to use holiday-themed fabric if you can. Tie the felt around the bottom rubber band as the snowman's scarf.
 Place two small sticks in the holes as arms. Try to push the sticks in further so they don't fall out. You may want to secure the sticks with hot glue.
, Use more cotton as snow and wrap up sugar cubes or dice with wrapping paper to use as presents.
