 Take four or five ice cubes, put them in a plastic bag, and cover the wax until it is suitably frozen.
,, A match is suitable, but a lighter is easier to use, and you don't risk burning yourself or dropping any spent embers.
 Make sure the back of your spoon gets placed directly where the wax is. Notice how the blotting paper soaks up the wax.
, Use rubbing alcohol (method explained above) or carpet detergent to lift any remaining dye from the wax from the carpet.









Mix one 1/2 tablespoon of carpet detergent with 2 cups of warm water.
Soak a cloth in the mixture, wring out, and cover the stain with the cloth.
Move from the outside in, gently working the cloth into the carpet and being careful not to spread the stain elsewhere on the carpet.
Repeat until as much dye as possible has been removed.
