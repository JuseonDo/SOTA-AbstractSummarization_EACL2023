 Once you get your wig wet, you will not be able to brush it again until the fibers dry. Brushing a wet wig can lead to frizz and damaged fibers.
 You will need to boil your water to a specific temperature range. Also, try to use the largest pot you can find so that you will have enough water to pour over your wig. The longer your wig is, the larger pot you will need.
 This is very important. If the water is not hot enough, the wig won't straighten. If the water is too hot, the fibers may melt.



If you have a very long wig, consider dipping the entire wig (still on the wig head) into the pot for 10 to 15 seconds, then pulling the wig out. Place the wig head back onto its stand.
 If you see some tangles, you can gently smooth them out with your fingers.Brushing a wet wig will damage the fibers.
 If you are in a hurry, you can place the wig in front of a fan. You can also blow a hairdryer over the wig, just make sure to use the "cool" setting.
 This method will usually straighten wavy wigs the first time. If your wig is very curly, you may need to repeat the whole process one or two more times. It also depends on how straight you want your wig to be. Let the wig dry completely before straightening it again.
