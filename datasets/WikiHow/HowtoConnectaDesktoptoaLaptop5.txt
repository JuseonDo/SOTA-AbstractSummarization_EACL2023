 Newer computers can use a standard Ethernet cable, as the network adapter will automatically detect that you are connecting two computers. Older computers may need to use a crossover cable, which is a standard Ethernet cable with the connection reversed on one end.


You can use internet connection sharing to share your internet connection with any computer that can connect via Ethernet, regardless of operating system.
 Select "Sharing" from the System Preferences menu.
 Do not check the box yet.
 If you are connecting two computer's via Ethernet, you'll usually be sharing your Wi-Fi connection


Older Macs will display "Airport" instead of "Wi-Fi".
 This will share the connection with any computer connected via Ethernet.
 Click Start if prompted.
 Once internet connection sharing has been activated on the first computer, the second computer should immediately have access to the internet.


It may take a moment for the second computer to retrieve a new IP address.
