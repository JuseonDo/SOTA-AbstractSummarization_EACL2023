 A good database for fanmail addresses is Fanmail.biz. If their address isn't on Fanmail, try Googling the celebrity's address. Or check their Twitter. A lot of celebrities give out their fanmail address via Twitter.;
, Make sure you say why you are writing and politely request an autograph from them. As a general guideline, handwritten is best, your letter should be no more than a page long, and its best to keep it semi professional. Some celebrities are a little put off by letters that are overly 'fan girly.' Make sure you sign the letter with your name, some celebrities will look at how you sign it to personalize their autograph to you.
 Make sure everything lays flat. If you are sending the request from another country, to the US, put in several IRC's (International Reply Coupons), which will allow the celebrity to get the correct postage to return your photo after they have signed it. You can only get IRC's at your post office/FedEx/etc.
 Do not seal the larger envelope.
 Then put the already stamped smaller envelope inside the larger one. Seal the larger envelope with the smaller inside it. Have them weigh and stamp the larger envelope now.
