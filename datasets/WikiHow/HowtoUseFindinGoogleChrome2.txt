 The search bar will protrude down from Chrome's navigation bar, cutting into the top right corner of the webpage.



It is not necessary to press ↵ Enter when you are done typing, because Chrome will automatically search for the term as you type.
 Once the term is typed, Chrome will highlight every instance that it is used on that webpage. For example, the search function will put “1 of 20” in the right side of the search box, telling you how many times the term was found.

As you press the arrows, the current instance that it is showing you will change from being highlighted in yellow to being highlighted in orange.
 When you are done using the tool, you can use either of these methods to close it. The highlights of your search term will disappear when it is closed.
