okay, first say to them, "stop instant messaging me!,

@summary
still instant messaging you?,

@summary
this is the fun part -they keep im-ing you write something like "who is this?,

@summary
if they continue, go to their name on your buddy list, right click and select block.

, Sign off, then sign back on. They should try to IM you. If not, you're free but go to last step.
 Who is this?" Over and over again. If they keep it up write something like "I know who you are! You're trying to take me back there! I'm not going back! I already lost a leg and an arm! You won't take me there alive! Never! NEVER!" Or something like that. They will think that you are weird and not IM you anymore and leave you alone. This is just an idea so make it your own!

, After you block them, set yourself invisible. They will then think that you are offline. These are all ideas but in the end if they won't block them and invisible.
