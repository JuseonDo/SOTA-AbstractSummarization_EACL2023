 A number is written in scientific notation when it is expressed in the form of a*10^n, where the absolute value of a is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and n is an integer.
 Here is the example number: 62,000,000.,

62,000,000. ---> 6.2000000

,

62,000,000 --->Â 6.2000000 The decimal point moved from the last 0 to 2.
 Therefore the scientific notation form of this number is 6.2*10^7.
