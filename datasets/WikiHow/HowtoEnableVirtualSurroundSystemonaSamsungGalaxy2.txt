 The icon usually looks like a video film with a play (triangle) symbol on it.
 Do this by simply tapping on it.
 Tap the menu button of your phone, and tap “Settings.” On doing this, the video will be paused and a new menu will appear on the screen.
 Another menu will appear, with the options “Normal,” “Voice,” “Music,” and “Virtual 7.1 ch.”

, Do this by tapping on the circle adjacent to “Virtual 7.1 ch” (or Virtual 5.1), and tap “Done.” Now, you can enjoy virtual surround sound on your device while watching a video.
