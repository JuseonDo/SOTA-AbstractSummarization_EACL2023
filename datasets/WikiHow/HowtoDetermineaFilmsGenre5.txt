 These movies typically take place in the American Midwest, and have a 95% chance of having Clint Eastwood in them.


If you see the name Clint Eastwood in the credits anywhere, prepare yourself for either a western movie or a film with terrible music.
 If so, it's known as a spaghetti western. Movies like For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly are spaghetti westerns.


Although "spaghetti western" is a slightly derogatory term, remember that some of the most famous movies of all time were directed by Italian people.
 If it's a pretty vast movie, it's probably an epic western. Use movies like The Magnificent Seven and Once Upon A Time In The West as a reference.
 This is an outlaw film. Look to films like The Last Outlaw and Tombstone for an idea.
 If so, it's most likely a marshall western. Movies like True Grit and Hang 'Em High fall into this sub-genre.
 This is a revenge western. Look to films like Unforgiven, Django, and Django Unchained for help.
