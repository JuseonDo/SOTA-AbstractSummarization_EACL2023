 Separate lettuce from the cluster. If the lettuce is from the garden, then you will need to soak it in salt water or use a drop of bleach to make sure it is properly clean.






;
, Cut the lettuce in whatever size you want, but preferable large cuts on a tray or bowl.
, If you are using lemon, then squeeze the lemons into a cup. If you are using vinegar, then pour a reasonable amount into a cup.
 The amount of sugar should be enough to have a thick syrup-like consistency. Mix it very well that the sugar crystals are not visible.
 Mix well.
 Mix lightly.
 This is optional.
