 Generally speaking, incidents are more likely to occur if you go to a gas station after dark or especially in the middle of the night, when there are few others around. If you're on the road early in the morning and run out of gas, call a roadside assistance service for help or ask a friend/family member to pick you up instead.;
, Sometimes you may not have a choice, but you shouldn't have to feel nervous when stopping for gas in a dark area or an unsafe part of town if you have other options.
 Never leave your car running idle or your doors unlocked as you get gas, even for a few moments or if there is someone inside it.
 Do not leave your purse, wallet, phone, etc. in the car.
 After you've filled up and paid, close up the gas tank and return to your vehicle promptly. Don't dawdle.
