 Hull them (remove the green stem) by using a knife or a tube huller. To hull with a knife, simply insert the knife on the top of the strawberry and gently press the stem with your thumb. Now move the knife in a circular manner to remove the stem. The removed part will look like a cone with the base containing the stem. Make sure you do not hull too much of the strawberry. After hulling, look for any solid matter inside the strawberry by inserting the knife and checking the tenderness of the strawberry. Remove any solid parts if present inside the strawberry.;
