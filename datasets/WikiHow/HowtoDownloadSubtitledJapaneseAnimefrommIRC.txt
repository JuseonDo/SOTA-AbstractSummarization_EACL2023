Once the option menu is up, you will notice 7 categories. They are Connect, IRC, Sounds, Mouse, DCC, Display and Other. Only 2 of them are important for this.
 Putting down your actual e-mail may result in receiving spam. mIRC has really grown in popularity and so be creative with your nickname because it may or may not be taken already.
 They are Server, Options, Local Info, Identd and Firewall.
 It’s recommended that you refer to the Help Section for an explanation on each sub-category.
 Why enable Identd? Many IRC servers require Identd in order to identify who you are and what operating system you’re running. Under User ID, you’ll type in the nickname you used in step 3; all other settings should be left on their default values.
 In this section, you’ll see “On Send Request? and “On Chat Request?. The settings for this section are more of a personal preference. For those that wish to request a download and let it download on it’s own you’ll change “On Send Request? to Auto-get file, “If file exists? to Resume. For those that wish to request a download and wait on it, you’ll select “Show get dialog?. It’s recommended that you leave the “On Chat Request? on Show chat dialog because IRC is filled with many spammer and this may cause your IRC client to be filled with extra windows filled with spamming messages from those uses.Note: Leaving Auto-get file on can be very risky depending on what room you’re in. Certain rooms may have users that’ll attempt to send other users viruses but most room Admins will usually kick those users out.
 and under Type select default.


Once you’ve selected default, click on edit and under “Into this folder�? change it to the location where you want your downloads to go.
 On the bottom, uncheck “Turn ignore back on in.?


If you feel this is going to end up having bots sent you all sorts of things then try this. Switch the method to “Accept only? and add the following extensions: *.avi, *.mkv, *.mp4, and *.ogm.Commonly known extensions for subbed Anime video files.Note: This is done in order to avoid having mIRC decline an anime download request because of its extension.
