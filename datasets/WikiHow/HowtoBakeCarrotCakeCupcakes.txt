 Be sure to adjust baking racks to the middle of the oven, to ensure an even baking throughout the cupcakes.;
, This will allow you to visualize all the ingredients before adding to the mixture, as well as keep the process organized.
 In a large stand mixer bowl combine sugars, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Be sure that the baking powder as well as baking soda is thoroughly incorporated into the dry mixture because this will allow the cake to rise evenly when baking.
 Beat this mixture with the paddle attachment for 2 to 3 minutes at a medium to high speed.
 Allow the mixer to thoroughly incorporate nuts before turning off the mixer.
 Fill each cup about 3/4 full with batter. You may wish to use an ice cream scoop for no-mess pouring.
,, Be sure that each of these ingredients are at room temperature so that they are soften, and combine more easily. Beat at a low speed until smooth and creamy, about 3-4 minutes. Add confectioner's sugar gradually, beating until smooth. Add more sugar to thicken or milk and/or water to thin the frosting, as needed.
 At this point, cupcakes should be cool enough to frost. Choose piping bag with your desired decorative tip and fill with the cream cheese frosting. Starting in the middle of the cake, push down slightly and swirl out to the sides. Garnish the top of the frosting with whole pecans or orange sprinkles.
