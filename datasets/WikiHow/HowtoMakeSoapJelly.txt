 Under the kitchen sink is a nice, out of the way place. When you have about 1 US-pint (473Â ml) or 2 cups of soap pieces, you are ready to make soap jelly.;
, For the pieces that get too small, simply throw them in to melt down but make sure they as small as possible.
 Stir in one tablespoon of borax. Make sure that the soap pieces dissolve completely.
, It is economical because every part of the soap gets used up.
