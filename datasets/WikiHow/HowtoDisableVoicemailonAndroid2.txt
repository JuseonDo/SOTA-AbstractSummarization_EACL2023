 Do so by tapping the multicolored triangle icon on one of your home screens.
,,,, This will be in the top right section of your screen.
 Once you do so, your app download will commence.
 You should see this appear in the Google Play store after your download finishes.,,,,, These include opening your Dialer app, pasting the number you copied, and calling it.


Make sure you don't kill the No More Voicemail app while doing this.
 Your No More Voicemail app is now set up--you should no longer receive voicemails from incoming calls.If your setup somehow fails during your first attempt, try setting up NMV a couple more times. Several users have reported that the first attempt doesn't work, but repeat attempts do.
