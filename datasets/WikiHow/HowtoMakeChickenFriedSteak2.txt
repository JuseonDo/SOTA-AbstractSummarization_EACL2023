 Steaks are done when they are golden brown on both sides. Note that thinner steaks will require less time than thicker steaks. Put them in a warm oven for the following steps.
 Make sure you start the roux off at a low-enough temperature so that the flour doesn't burn.
 Whisk until the mixture can coat the back of a spoon, about 4 to 7 minutes. Now you have gravy!








, Serve with mashed potatoes and veggies, or any other combination you desire.
