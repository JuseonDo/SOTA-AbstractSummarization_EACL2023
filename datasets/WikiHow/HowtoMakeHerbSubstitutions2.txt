 Caraway and cumin are related, since they are both in the parsley family. They also have a similar taste, although cumin has a nutty and smoky flavor whereas caraway has sweet and earthy tones.Start with a little less caraway than the recipe lists for cumin and then build it up to get the flavor profile you desire.You can also replace the cumin with ground coriander but you should be aware that it wonâ€™t be as smoky and nutty in flavor.The coriander will give it more of a lemony flavor., If you need a substitute for fresh cilantro, you can use an equivalent amount of fresh parsley, tarragon, or dill. Alternately, combine a bit of all three to replace an equal amount of cilantro. The substitute works best for garnishes., If you need to replace coriander seed or ground coriander, you can use an equivalent amount of cumin, fennel or caraway seeds. You can also use a combination of all three., For example, you could use any of the following substitutions:


Substitute marjoram for sage. It is savory like sage but has more citrus tones.
Substitute rosemary for sage. Rosemary has more pine and citrus tones than sage but can work fine.
Substitute thyme for sage. It has more mint notes than sage but will work nicely.
Substitute savory for sage. It has a similar peppery flavor to sage so use it if you want to really bring out the peppery side of a dish., Winter savory has a bit of a stronger taste so keep that in mind when adding the summer savory. You can also use any of the following substitutions:


Replace summer savory with thyme and a little bit of mint.
Replace summer savory with a mix of half parsley and half celery leaves.
