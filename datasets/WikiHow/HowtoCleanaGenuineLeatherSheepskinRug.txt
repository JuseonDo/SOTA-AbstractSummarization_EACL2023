@summary
give the sheepskin a good brush with a proper sheepskin carding brush while it is still dry to get out as many knots as you can before the sheepskin gets wet.

@summary
handwash or gently machine wash.

@summary
don’t agitate or massage the sheepskin wool too much while washing; you just want a gentle swishing action of water moving through the wool to dislodge dirt particles.

@summary
drain the dirty water and refill the bath with fresh warm water to rinse the last soap and dirt away.

@summary
roll the sheepskin rug up and squeeze out as much water as you can, then let it drain for about 20 minutes.

@summary
dry the sheepskin rug (after spinning out excess water).

@summary
take care not to place the sheepskin on a radiator, steam pipe or in front of a fan heater as this may damage the sheepskin rug.

@summary
use a metal bristle wool carding brush to brush the wool lightly while it is still damp.

@summary
dyed sheepskins should be dry cleaned because washing will most likely remove too much dye coloring.

 That way, the wool will not mat up more during the washing process.;
, Larger sheepskins can be washed in a bath using luke warm water (38°C/100°F) and using a small amount of sheepskin woolskin wash. Single sheepskins can be washed on a gentle wool cycle in a washing machine if you don't want to hand wash.
 But not so much movement that the wool mattes up like felt. Swish the water gently for three to five minutes.
 Repeat the rinse until the water stays mostly clear.
 After this, transfer the rug to a washing machine (if it fits) and a pin out most of the excess water gently. You could use a laundromat to spin out the excess water for larger sheepskins. You may also let it drip dry, but this will take a lot longer.
 Use a clean towel to lay it on and pull the leather into shape making sure it is laying flat, leave it this way for 24 hours. It is important that the leather dries slowly away from high heat like direct sunlight and high artificial heat or the leather could shrink or harden. A low heat setting is OK in a tumble dryer for a single sheepskin. For larger sheepskins a dehumidifier can help speed up the drying time without damaging the leather.
 Don’t be tempted to speed up the drying process.
 If it is a warm day the wool will dry very fast. Give the sheepskin wool another good brush as it dries and a final brush once completely dry. The end result should be fluffy and knot free. Don't worry if some wool comes out in the carding brush, this is normal.
 If you do wash a dyed sheepskin rug use table salt in the water to help fix the dye and to stop too much washing out.
