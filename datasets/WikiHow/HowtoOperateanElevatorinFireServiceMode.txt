know that fire service mode can be activated automatically (whenever smoke is detected within the building) or manually (using a key switch located on the ground floor).

@summary
understand that when fire service mode is activated, each elevator will automatically return to the ground floor.

@summary
at this point, the elevators will remain inoperable.

@summary
you may now select a floor (or group of floors) to go to.

@summary
the elevator will not leave the floor until the "door close" button is held down.

@summary
the elevator will travel to the desired floor.

@summary

, If smoke has been detected on the ground floor, the elevators will return to an alternate floor. Once the elevators have arrived at the recall floor, the doors will open.
 In order to use them, you must set the fire service key switch (located in each elevator) to one of the following positions:


On: Permits usage of the elevator in fire service mode
Bypass: Returns the elevator to normal operation

, Pressing the "Call Cancel" button will clear your selection(s).
 You must hold this button until the doors are fully closed; otherwise, they will reopen.
 When it stops, the doors will remain closed. This is a safety feature. You must hold the "Door Open" button until the doors are fully open. If smoke or flames enter the elevator, release the button immediately. The doors will close.
 This prevents others from using the elevator. To continue using fire service mode, reinsert the key and turn it to "On".
, To return them to normal operation, turn the fire recall switch (located in the hallway) to "Reset".




It should be noted that each elevator manufacturer uses their own fire service key. That's why you often see a Knox- box for firefighters to obtain the proper key for a building's specific model elevator. For example, a Dover (Thyssen-Krupp) elevator uses a different key than an Otis.
