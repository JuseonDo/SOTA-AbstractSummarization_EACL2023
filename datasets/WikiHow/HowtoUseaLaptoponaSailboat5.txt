 Things happen at sea and the laptop could stop working, fall overboard, get dropped one too many times, etc. Ensure that your precious information has been backed up and kept elsewhere and not just on the laptop. You could use cloud computing methods, email your information, or use a hardy external drive kept safely somewhere else onboard.
 Use a calendar or a phone reminder if needed.
