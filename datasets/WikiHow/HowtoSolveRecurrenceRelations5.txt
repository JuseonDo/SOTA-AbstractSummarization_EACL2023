 This cannot be solved by any of the above methods, but a formula can be found by using generating functions.
 A generating function is simply a formal power series where the coefficient of xn is the nth term of the sequence.
 The objective in this step is to find an equation that will allow us to solve for the generating function A(x). Extract the initial term. Apply the recurrence relation to the remaining terms. Split the sum. Extract constant terms. Use the definition of A(x). Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.
, The methods for doing this will vary depending on exactly what A(x) looks like, but the method of partial fractions, combined with knowing the generating function of a geometric sequence, works here as shown.
