 Green vegetables contain chlorophyll, when chlorophyll is cooked, it produces carbon dioxide. Since you have to cover the vegetables to steam them, the chlorophyll turns a drab, grayish color. You can prevent this by boiling the greens, in salted water.;
, The recipe calls for one ounce for every four cups of water. The salt provides a "barrier" against the carbon dioxide, and keeps the chlorophyll green.
 This will ensure the pores on the vegetables will be quickly blocked, and prevent vitamins and minerals from leaching out into the water.
 You do not want to overcook, or undercook them. For broccoli, about 5-7 minutes, green beans, 10-12. Just keep testing them with a fork.
 The best way to do this is a quick ice bath. Strain the vegetables into a colander, then dip them into a bowl, or sink, of ice cold water. This prevents accidental overcooking.
