@article
 Make a figure of 8 with your first rubber band and poke your index finger through one hole and your middle finger through the other.
 This time, don't twist them to make a figure 8. Instead, simply slide them over your fingers in an 0 shape.
 Take one side of the bottom band and bring it up and over your finger, and then drop it so that it rests on top of the other two rubber bands, in between your fingers. Do the same with the other side.
 Place it on top of the last one, spread between your fingers. Make sure you do this after each step, so that there are always three rubber bands on your fingers.
 Pull one end up over your finger and drop it over the rubber bands in the middle, and repeat with the other side. Then add another rubber band to your fingers.
 You will quickly see a fishtail pattern forming between your fingers; this will be your bracelet. Keep weaving the rubber bands until the bracelet is big enough to fit around your wrist.
 Take the two bottom bands and pull them over so that you only have one around your fingers. Then slip the loose ends onto a C or S clip, and do the same with the loose end on the bottom of the bracelet.
