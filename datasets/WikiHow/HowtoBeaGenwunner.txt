@article
 Genwunners must have pride in themselves, and have no fear in saying that Gen 1 is their favourite generation.;
, If someone that likes later generations such as Gen 5 says that all 649 Pokémon are good, you must take part in a dangerous duel of buzzwords and arguments.
 Most people that hate Gen 1 always list it's flaws, such as "having too much bugs" or "being clunky overall". Remember, even by having recognized those flaws, you can ignore them and go on with your life.
 If you end up angered at someone in the internet, you always lose.
