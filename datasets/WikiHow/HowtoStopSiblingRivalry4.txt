 Some squabbles are so small that they will easily pass in a moment. Children will benefit tremendously from learning how to work through disagreements on their own. Teach kids some basic negotiation skills.
 Separate the kids if they are physically fighting. Avoid waiting until things escalate. This sends a message to the children that they have already gone far enough.
 Focus on problem-solving and finding win-win solutions, where actions and consequences apply to everyone involved.
 They need to feel that they have been given a chance to explain themselves. Set up a rule of allowing one child to speak at a time uninterrupted by the others. Be their interpreter instead of a referee.
, This will help teach children that they have choices in which to handle matters.
