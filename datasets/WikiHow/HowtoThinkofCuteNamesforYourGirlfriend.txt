 Some girlfriends like cute names, others don't, so know your girlfriend's preferences before trying this out on her!;
, For example, Baby girl.
 For example, if their name's Sally, saying something like Sally Wally is just sad.
 That's too gross.
 For example: "Jennifer" she probably gets Jen, Jenny or J from other people, so call her something cute like Jinny, or FerFer, or play off her last name. Anything that other people she knows aren't doing.
 For example, "Hey fairycakes". It's a sweet food, sweet fairy, and a sweet name.
 It's really romantic and it will make her feel special (plus not embarrassed).


Don't go crazy and make loads of different names for her, a few is fine.
 Its very important your girlfriend approves of it and likes being call by that name.
