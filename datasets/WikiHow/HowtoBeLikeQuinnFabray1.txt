gather your hair into a tight ponytail at the top of your head (either brushing it back of securing your bangs in a hairgrip) and secure.

@summary

 Remember: Quality is not always Quantity, and while Quinn has more of the latter, it's preferable that you have loyal friends! Aim for more quality friends. They always "make it easier, when life gets hard". (pun intended.)[[;
, Show that you're confident, in charge and to be respected. Also, try to improve your sense of humor-witty comebacks are a must. Speak with confidence.

Split this into 4-6 (Depending on your hair type) sections, and curl each of the sections in turn to get either spiraling curls of tight waves. Use hairspray to fix.
 Make sure your skin is clear and smooth (Wash your face twice a day and keep care of it!)


Use concealer and foundation for this if you like. Stick to mineral or powder foundations- these are better for your skin and look more natural. Don't apply too much!
Apply a rosy blusher on the apples of the cheeks, giving yourself a natural flush. Smile as you apply it to hit the cheekbones.
Curl your eyelashes than apply some voluminous mascara; Quinn has very long, curly lashes. Line the top lid of your eyes, winging it slightly.
Finally, apply some rosy pink lipstick/stain and perhaps use clear gloss on top.
 Try to get involved in the cheer-leading team at your school if you have one. Not sporty? Choose a hobby that your good at, and work hard at it! Be proud of it, and don't be afraid to brag about it at school.
