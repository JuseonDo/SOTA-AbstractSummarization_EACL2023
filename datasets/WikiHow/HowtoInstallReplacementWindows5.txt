 Sill flashing for a vinyl window is an “L” shaped piece of vinyl that is the same width as the replacement window unit. The vertical part of the “L” shape is slotted, allowing it to clip onto the bottom, outer edge of the window unit and shed water away from the bottom of the window.
 Mark both sides where it hits the exterior window stops. Remove the lower part of the “L” shape on both sides as marked to allow the sill flashing to fit into place. Once trimmed, lay the sill flashing back in place and trace the outside edge with a pencil.
 Make sure you get both sides and the top. Then, apply a 1/4″ bead directly to the wood sill on the inside of your pencil line.
, The bottom should be angled away and in to the opening. Once the bottom of the unit has cleared the sill and is against the exterior stops, press down on the window and swing the top into the frame.


Press the window firmly and evenly against the stops to ensure a good seal.
 (These are usually located about four inches from the top and bottom on both sides.
 Be sure the window is centered in the window opening. (Keep in mind that vinyl is much softer, and more flexible than wood. Over-tightening the screws can damage the frame of the window.)
