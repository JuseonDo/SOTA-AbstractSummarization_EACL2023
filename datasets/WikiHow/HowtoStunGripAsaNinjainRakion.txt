,, To do that create a new stage game (1st stage). When you enter do not go through the door. Stay where you are. You have 9mins to practise before game ends. Do the following thing: Left click (wait one second) left+right click. This will produce a slash and invincible jump attack if done right. When you do the same fluently on an opponent you will stun grip him/her.
