, Line the cupcake tins with baking cups or spray the inside of each cup with non-stick spray.
 Before adding the flour, sift it into a separate bowl to ensure a smooth texture.
 For best results, use an electric mixer or combine ingredients using a wire whisk. Keep the jalapenos and cheese to the side.
 Don’t over use the mixer––just combine until the mixture is slightly moistened.
 Mix until the cheese and jalapenos are evenly disseminated into the batter.
, Since each oven bakes at a different rate, test the cupcakes by sticking a toothpick into the middle of one cupcake after they have been baking for approximately 11 minutes. Then quickly remove it and see if any of the batter sticks to the toothpick. If batter remains on the toothpick return the cupcakes to the oven and continue baking for one or two more minutes. Try the toothpick test again to see if they are baked.



Assemble the ingredients listed above.
Mash the avocado using a fork or potato masher. Add lime juice to create a smooth green paste.
Add the remaining ingredients to the avocado and lime mixture and combine well.
, Top with a slice of jalapeno or candied jalapeno. Serve immediately.
