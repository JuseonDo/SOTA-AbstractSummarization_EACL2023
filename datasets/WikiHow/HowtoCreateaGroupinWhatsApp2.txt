 If you don't have WhatsApp for Android yet, it's free to download from the Google Play Store.


If you can't locate WhatsApp on your phone, try searching for it using Google's "In App" feature.
 You'll find this at the bottom of your screen in WhatsApp's toolbar.


If WhatsApp opens to your last-used chat, tap the "Chats" option in the top left corner to view the Chats menu.
 Doing so will prompt a menu from within the Chats page.
 This will prompt you to select members for your group.
 You can also search for specific contacts from within the search bar at the top of your screen.


You cannot add people who aren't currently in your contacts.
Tap the "OK" button in the top right corner of your screen when you're ready to continue.
 You'll do this in the field at the top of the screen.
 You can do this by tapping the empty box next to the group name, then selecting a photo from your photo library.


You can also take a photo from within WhatsApp if you like.
 This is in the top right corner of your screen. You now have a group on WhatsApp!
