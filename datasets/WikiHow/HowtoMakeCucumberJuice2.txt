 Use a peeler to remove the waxy skin and a knife to chop off the ends. Cube the cucumbers with a knife to make them easier to work with.
 You can either use a hand grater or a box grater, depending one whichever is easiest for you to work with. Grate the cucumbers into a bowl to avoid losing any shreds.
 Bring the water and sugar to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Once it boils, the sugar should break down into the water, making it a little thicker.
 Turn the heat down to medium-low or medium and simmer the mixture for approximately 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Heating the cucumbers together with the water and sugar combines the flavors more thoroughly than mixing them cold.
 Allow it to cool slightly, at least until it stops bubbling and steaming.
 Blend it on a high speed until it resembles a puree with very few noticeable chunks of cucumber remaining. Blending releases more of the juice trapped inside the cucumber.
 The cheesecloth should be large enough to drape over the sides of the bowl.
 Go slowly to prevent the sides of the cheesecloth from slipping down into the puree.
 Knot the cloth or tie it to secure the ends in place.
 Once the juice stops dripping out on its own, squeeze the cheesecloth pouch to wring out any excess. When squeezing the pouch no longer produces juice, remove the cheesecloth and discard or save as desired.
 Stir to combine. Salt takes off the bitter edge that cucumber juice naturally has, but the bitterness may already be less obvious due to the sweeteners.
 Save any extra inside the refrigerator up to a week.
