 These are called diphthongs. Here are the combinations:


aoi - Pronounced "ee" - Example: Aoife
ao - Pronounced "ay" - Example: Caol치n
eo - Pronounced "oh" - Example: Eoin
io - Pronounced "ih" - Example: Siobh치n
ia - Pronounced "ee" - Example: Niamh
e치 - Pronounced "awe" - Example: Se치n;
,


Example: Eoin contains Eo paired with i. Eo is pronounced "oh". If you pronounce them separately, it becomes "Oh-in", which has been Anglicized into Owen.
