 Many child care centers have long waiting lists, so it is never too early to start looking. If you are pregnant, start looking for child care for after your baby is born.;
, Often there is a waiting period for these funds, and they are only accepted by certain child care providers. You can find information about child care subsidies at the Administration for Children and Families website at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ccb/parents/index.htm.
 How many children need care? How old are they? What hours do you need care? Where should the child care provider be located? When does your child need to start?

, What are the most important features of a child care provider? Does your child have special needs, like nutritional concerns or disabilities? Do you want a child care provider that implements an educational curriculum? Do you prefer a larger playground? Do you prefer mixed-age classes or same-age classes? Do you prefer a center that provides meals or do you want to provide all of your child's food? Is it important for a center to be close to your home or work?

,,, Most states have searchable lists of providers that give information such as hours of operation, age of children accepted, total number of children allowed in the center, and whether they accept state child care subsidies.
, Take good notes while you are on the phone so that you can keep the information straight.
, Bring a list of questions to ask the staff members.
 You should check in with a staff member as soon as you arrive and try not to disturb the children or caregivers. Good providers have an open door policy for parents that allows you to observe caregivers without making an appointment or calling ahead.
 If possible, make arrangements for you child to play with the other children or sit in on a lesson.
 Try to make extra time when you drop-off and pick-up your child to chat with the caregivers and observe your child's interaction with them and the other children.
