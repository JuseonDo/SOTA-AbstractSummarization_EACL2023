 Vitamin D deficiency affects your muscle strength. Feeling weak, especially for no particular reason, can be a sign that your vitamin D levels are low., Because vitamin D is necessary for a healthy bone structure, its deficiency can cause malformations in children and a decreased bone density in adults., Children who do not get enough vitamin D may show bone deformities and develop rickets. Rickets is the term for the softening of bones that occurs when bone mineralization is defective due to vitamin D, calcium or phosphate deficiencies.


If left untreated rickets can lead to a curved spine, skeletal deformities, dental problems, and seizures.You should talk to your pediatrician if your child is not growing at a consistent rate, and check if this might be due to vitamin D deficiency.
 These could be a sign of osteomalacia, a defective bone mineralization in adults linked to low levels of vitamin D.Low levels of vitamin D can also be the reason behind pain or a slow recovery after a work out session.
 This could also be a sign of low vitamin D levels, especially if you sweat in conditions in which your normally wouldnâ€™t, such as mild temperatures or during a period of inactivity.


Although this might be too vague a symptom for adults, a sweaty forehead in newborns is one of the most evident symptoms of vitamin D deficiency., Low levels of vitamin D can also impact the hormones affecting our mood, such as serotonin. For this reason, some cases of vitamin D deficiency can be misdiagnosed as depression.
