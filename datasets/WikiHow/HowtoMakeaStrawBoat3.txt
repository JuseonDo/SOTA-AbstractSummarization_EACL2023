, Gather more straws, paper, and scissors., This will be the base of your deck., This is your door.,, Castles are like passenger seats. Cut a cube, but leave off one side.,, If you want to do it before you tape it down, that's fine, too., Cut a small length of straw and tape it to the side of your raft. Repeat about 3 times, then repeat it on the other side., If it floats, you're good! If it doesn't float, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tin foil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges.
