 Take out the mattress. Next, take one side out, and keep it for another kid or throw it out. Measure the size of the mattress, then find a chalkboard that fits. Add any hooks for supplies you want.
 Tie a rubber band over the latch. Make an eight shape, then hook it over each knob.
 Cut each pool noodle into quarters, then cut down one side of the noodle. It doesn't have to be straight, but it helps if it is.This method also adds some bling to the trampoline!

, This also provides a backrest your child can lean against, and sides to hold onto.
 Buy a roll of oilcloth or plastic, and duct tape it to the table. You could also simply cover it with duct tape.
 Fold the sheet in half, and loop it over the top of the hula hoop. Tie it to a tree to keep it standing up.
 The baby will want to suck on it, and will not realize it is medicine. Make sure to completely clean the pacifier before giving it back to the baby.
 Turn the sheet diagonally, then tie the ends over the table. Tie the other ends over the baby to help avoid falling babies.
 Whenever you go out in public with your child, have them wear the bracelet. If they ever get lost they can use the number on the bracelet to call for help.
 Place each pool noodle at the edge of the bed. Cover and tighten their bed with a sheet. Whenever you child is close to falling down they won't, because of the protection of the pool noodle(s).
 Cover it with a blanket, and fill it with toys and pillows. The best type to buy is one with an inflatable bottom as to provide a soft space even when the baby walks.
