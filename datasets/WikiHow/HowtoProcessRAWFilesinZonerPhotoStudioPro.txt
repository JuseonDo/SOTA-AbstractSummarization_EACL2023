 Navigate your way to the location of the file you want to edit and click on it.;
, This will open up the RAW module for you to make your changes in. This image is a little dark and had the wrong white balance selected.
 You will find this on the top toolbar.
 Cropping in the RAW module is rather tedious, so unless there is a pressing reason to crop it there, don't do it. It is much easier to crop it in the Editor module.
 If you only see the words, but no tools, click on the arrow that you see there.
 This will open up the various options that you have for adjusting the white balance.
 Did you use a flash, were you inside, outside, in the shade, etc. Look at it and decide if that looks 'right' to you. If not, click the white balance undo arrow. If you follow one wrong selection with another one, it's still wrong.
 The example here was done this way.
 Here is where experimentation will be the most helpful. Basically, if you want to lighten it, you can use the exposure or lights slider bars.
 The one that can be the most fun (and potentially insanity producing) is the Tone Curve. However, learning this tool will make the RAW module just that much more effective.
