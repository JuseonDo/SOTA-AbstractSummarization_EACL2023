 If at all possible, start with an organic orange, lemon, or other citrus fruit. While some authorities recommend the use of organic citrus fruit, it is difficult to find. Thoroughly washing and drying the fruit should make the fruit safe to eat. If there is a concern, shop for organic citrus fruit.;
, Cut out any discolorations or bad spots.
 Pull the the zester across the surface and the zest will appear.
 A microplane is like a grater. Pull it across the fruit to separate the zest.
 If you do not have a zester or microplane, take a vegetable peeler and peel the citrus rind. Once the peel is removed, finely mince the zest using a knife. The food processor can also mince the peel, if a food processor is available.
 Once the citrus fruit peel has been zested, freeze it in small freezer storage bags or containers. The zest is available for later cooking.
 Spread it in a single layer on a plate or waxed paper and leave it exposed to the air until it is dry enough to be brittle (a couple of days).
