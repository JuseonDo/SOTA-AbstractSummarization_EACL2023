 If you're the sort to allow clothes, books and electronic gizmos to pile up on the bed, remove them before the shoot. A messy bed will be very distracting to anyone looking at the images.;
, This part is pretty important––as with a messy bed, rumpled and multi-layered bed linen will distract viewers from the subject of your photo.
 While your pet will possibly wrinkle it, do your best to start out as smooth as possible; you can always pull at the edges again while the pet is seated or lying in place.
, Drape the remaining section of it over the bed a good ways. This forms the seating or lying area for your pet, so take care that it's not so taut that the pet's weight will pull the pins from the wall. Simple is better. Make sure the sheet or quilt doesn't have to many complicated patterns.
 Encourage him or her to sit or lie in place. This might take some time, so be patient and be prepared to stroke your pet or use treats. When the pet is finally comfortable, start taking pictures and practicing with lighting, reflectors, and diffusers.
