 Tobacco was once thought to make acid reflux symptoms worse. However, three studies so far have shown no improvement after patients quit smoking., There is no evidence that mustard helps with this problem.
 Doctors do not recommend this treatment., The "heel drop" treatment is a chiropractic technique not based on scientific evidence, though there is some anecdotal evidence that it can help. Discuss all exercises with your physician first.
