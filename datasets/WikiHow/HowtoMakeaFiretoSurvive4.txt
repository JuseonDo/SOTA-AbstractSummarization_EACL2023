@summary
collect the equipment you will need for the bow drill:

@summary
a short spindle should be used due to the downward pressure that will be applied, so that it does not bend or break.

@summary
set up the bow drill.

@summary
move the bow back and forth while pushing downward on the spindle to create friction and make an ember.

A top handle that has another bowl carved out of it will be held in your left hand for stability.
A bow with the string wrapped once around the spindle will be used to do the back and forth motions.
A string. A boot's shoelace works very well for this application, due to the standard sizes being very long.
 The setup should not differ very much from the one in this image. Wrap the string around the spindle once. Tie the ends of the shoelace to the ends of the bow. Place the spindle on the piece of wood which you will make the ember on, and place a piece of small wood on top of the spindle for stabilization.
