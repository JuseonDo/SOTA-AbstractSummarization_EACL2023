,, That includes people you may not like or get along with. Do not hate.
 Not to have a bigger treasure in heaven, but because you want to do good/right. You glorify God every time you do a good deed or perform an act of kindness, since you are one of his children.
 It's the only REAL "How To" about Christianity! Seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit because it is a promise given to everybody not only to guide but also to teach us.
 Many people have trouble with that one. Judging is for God to do, not us. As Christians, we are called to love each other, and that means leaving the judging to God. Rebuking others (preferably as compassionately as possible) is fine, but first you must do as Jesus says, and "Take the plank out of your eye before you try to remove the speck from another's eye", otherwise you will only be a hypocrite.
 Just like eating and drinking to sustain your soul and body.
 That means give up your right to hate, judge or even get revenge. Set it right--if you can--but that is not revenge.
 That will help you spread the word of God.
