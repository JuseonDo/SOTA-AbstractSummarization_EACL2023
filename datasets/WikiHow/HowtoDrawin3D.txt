 This will make it easier to create your 3D drawing.;
, Draw lightly at first so you can erase any unnecessary pencil marks later.
 At this point don't worry if they are completely visible in real life. They will help finish your drawing.
 Move to a different angle if you need to see where some lines should go. Once you have finished the basic outline, erase any line you cannot actually see from the angle in which you are drawing.
 Begin drawing the details in pencil, then retrace with ink. Once the ink is finished add the coloring and shading for the object.
