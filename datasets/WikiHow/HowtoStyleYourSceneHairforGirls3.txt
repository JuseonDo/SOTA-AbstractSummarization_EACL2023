Follow all directions on any manuals or packaging for the iron for safety and to avoid damaging your hair.
Clamp the iron down on a section of hair and gently but smoothly run the iron down to the tip.
Section your straightened hair into several small pieces and clip them in place.



Start by taking one section of hair near your crown, removing the clip, and combing it towards your scalp. This is also known as backcombing or teasing. The technique creates extra volume and makes it easier to shape your style.
Don't worry about the pieces that look too wild. You will tame them later.
Spray with a backcomb or finishing spray after teasing it.
