, Select the "Trade-in" link for the game.
 UPC's are generally located on the back of a game's case in one of the lower corners. Online retailers ask for these to confirm that you have a legal copy of the game.
 An 8.5 inch (203 mm) by 11 inch (279 mm) padded envelope fits most games.



Some online retailers do not provide pre-paid shipping. If this is the case, you need to purchase the proper postage or shipping label (from a courier of your choice) and obtain the retailer's shipping address.
 Once they receive the game and find it to be in working order they will credit you with a trade-in value.


Sometimes money is credited through a service such as PayPal, but most online retailers offer credit on store-specific gift cards (as with Amazon) and fee reductions on services (as with GameFly).
