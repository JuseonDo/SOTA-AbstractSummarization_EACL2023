 Leaves that are dried will not work, as they'll snap and crumble when pressed or worked on.


Make sure that the leaves are dry before using.;
,, Squeeze a little paint onto a small plate or palette.
 This is best done by placing the leaf on kitchen paper towel and painting over using a small paint roller suitable for craft projects. Make sure the entire leaf is covered.
 Carefully but firmly press on the leaf to ensure that the entire leaf comes into contact with the paper.
, The same leaf can be used up to six times before it ceases to leave an acceptable imprint. And by adding different sorts of leaves, you can build a pretty pattern or design for gift paper, cards, a painting, or any other paper craft project.


Add more leaves of different sizes and in different colors.
 Then frame or use your masterpiece for whatever purpose intended.
