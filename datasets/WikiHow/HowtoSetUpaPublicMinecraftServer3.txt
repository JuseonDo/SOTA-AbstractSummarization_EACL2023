However you will need a username and password for this so go to:http://portforward.com/default_username_password/and find your routers default username and password and then type it in. When done you will have access now, so look for something called "port forwarding" or "port triggering" and click onto it. Then now we can add our own custom service so click something like "add custom service" and name the service whatever you want to, change the service type to TCP/UDP, and change the start and finish port to "25565".Now look for something called "firewall rules" or "internal IP address" or "outbound services" and "inbound services" once found change the "internal IP address" to your IPv4 address., So now your in you may ask " how do my friends join?" well go into your browser and type "IP" and this number is what you give to people you trust not strangers ).So give the public IP to your friends.
