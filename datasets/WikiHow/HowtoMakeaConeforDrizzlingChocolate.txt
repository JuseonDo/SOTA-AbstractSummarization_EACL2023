See Things You'll Need for paper variation suggestions.;
,, This will make two pieces in the shapes of triangles. Both can be turned into cones, the second one only needs to be made up if the first one starts to sag during use.
 Staple together. If you're really clever, you can actually avoid stapling it by tucking the tail of the cone into the side seam. If you're not certain how to do that, stay safe and use the staples.
, Fold down again to close.
 Be careful, as the chocolate will start oozing out as soon as the hole is created.


How large the opening is made will determine how much chocolate drizzles out, which will affect the thickness of the lines and shapes drizzled.
 Keep the pointed end over the item to be drizzled on and squeeze gently. Work your way gradually over the item and drizzle away.
