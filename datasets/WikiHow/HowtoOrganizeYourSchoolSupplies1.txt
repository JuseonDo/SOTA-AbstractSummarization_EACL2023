;
, Keep your papers in there. Don't be lazy––organize them whenever they get a little untidy. When you get to class, all you've got to do is to pull your folder up, and there you have everything you need. You should keep your old notes in a box, you may need them later.
 Don't mix your notes up or you will make it harder to find what you're looking for. Write nicely, to make it easier to understand what you've written later. Another good thing to do is have folders with holes on the inside to put notes in.
 That way you can keep all of your pencils, pens, etc. in the pencil case. You'll know where they are, and you won't have to look for that one pencil. The case can get quite messy, so you should throw away broken pencils and everything you don't need.
