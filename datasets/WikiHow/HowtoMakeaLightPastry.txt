 Wrap the butter in foil and put it in the freezer for 30-45 minutes until firm.;
,, Remove the butter from the freezer and partially unwrap. Using the coarse grate of a cheese grater, grate the butter into the bowl of flour.
 Using a wooden spoon or a palette knife, disperse the butter throughout the flour. Do not use your hands just yet, as the warmth from your hands will melt the butter.
 When the butter is evenly distributed, add two tablespoons of cold water.
 Still using the wooden spoon or palette knife, mix in the water.
 If you need more liquid add cold water one tablespoon at a time.
 Mixing is complete when the pastry comes away without sticking or leaving any bits of butter or loose flour behind.
 Put the dough into a sealable bag and freeze for at least 30 minutes.
