, If you are installing a full card and not just a USB adapter, this is a job that needs to be done with the machine off and unplugged.



For some older PCs, this requires unscrewing connector pins on the back of the case. For most Macs and PCs, it will only require pulling on a switch that will allow you to either pull down the side or fully remove part of the case.



Find an empty PCI slot on a PC computer. Make sure to remove the faceplate for that port before trying to install the card. This will expose the new card from the back of your PC when you close the case.
For a Mac, locate the Airport card slot. On most G5 Power Macs, it is generally part of the metal wall that separates the logic board. On the iMac G4, the card slot is in the rounded base. And in the iMac G5, it's right in the middle when you've unscrewed the whole back plate.



On a PC, insert the card until it is firmly seated in the port. Attach any screws associated with the card using a Phillips-head screwdriver. Attach the antenna to the outside of the card, and close your case.
On a Mac, connect the antenna cable to the back of the card and plug the card into the board. It will only connect one way, so if it doesn't work the first time just turn it around. Generally you'll turn the label face down so you can see the serial number and other written details on the card.
, This is not necessary, but it's a good practice to make sure that your laptop is safe.
, Make sure to connect the antenna to the wireless card. Then close your laptop.
