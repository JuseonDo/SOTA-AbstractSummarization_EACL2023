, You can do this either online or directly on the phone following directions in the box. You will have to get a new number first; make sure the new number is from the same zipcode as your skype number.
 You need this because AT&T will not port your number unless the phone is active with credit and Google Voice calls your phone as part of the porting process so you need prepaid time on your account or you won't receive the call.
 When they ask you for your account number, give them your skype number. The porting process takes much longer for skype numbers, usually between 3-7 days.
 You will need this as part of the Google Voice port process.
 You will provide your GoPhone number and account number and receive a call on your GoPhone asking you to verify the code Google shows you online. This costs $20.00.
