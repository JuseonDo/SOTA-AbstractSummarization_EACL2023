 Keep in mind that you'll be playing every part.
 From here, you could either plan your game or improvise.
 Once again, it doesn't matter how you start- just start. It will get the creativity flowing.



Surprise yourself! Half of the fun when playing with Barbies is the surprise and unexpectedness of what another person that you're playing with will say. If you play with yourself, you'll be in complete control, but don't let that stop you! Don't think about what you'll reply to yourself with, just reply!
