This section of hair is normally taken from the front and center of the head and should be in a horizontal line (i.e. from the same row of hair, rather than lower or higher).
The section can also be taken from the side of the head if you are choosing to create a side French braid or a French braid that runs diagonally across the back of your head.;
,


Repeat this two more times, crossing the left section over the new middle section, and then the right section over the middle again.
This is a basic Braid, which will form the beginning of your French braid.
 Cross this left section over the middle.
 Cross this right section over the middle section.



If your hair is long enough, then continue to braid normally until you come to the end.
