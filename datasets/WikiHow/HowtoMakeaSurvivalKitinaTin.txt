 As well as its main storage space its lid is highly reflective.;
, This can be fashioned into a small pan to collect water to boil or drink, for cooking or washing out of.
 Preferably your loudest whistle.
 Containing domestic bleach for water purification.
 Dipping them in wax keeps them dry. If you're at a loose end you can eat the wax scrapings. Scrape the wax off when you need the match.
 A combination of uses: a waterproof lighter, lubricant and food stuff.
 Amazing water-proof firelighters.
 Another combo use tool: An effective firelighter, first-aid swab and lubricant.
 This a good a message-writer, obviously, but its lead will also provide an excellent lubricant. An added bonus is its shavings can be used as dry tinder. The notebook is optional

, In addition to its first aid uses it can make essential repairs and can be used as a trap for insects -perfect bait.
 Use in combination with the tape to get insects for dinner. Bee soup is quite nourishing.
 You can use these for obvious clothing repairs or as a fishing hook. Grab a long stick, your caught insects, attach a pin and some foil for the lure and you're on your way.
 Will improve the taste of any of the ghastly things you may have to eat.
 I bet you knew I would include this. For gutting, skinning, sawing and so forth. Preferably get a high end model with as many attachments as you can.
 In addition to its uses as shelter suspension, strung between trees, it can be used for hang food or clothes. Plus its inner filaments are perfect for sewing, snare-manufacture, tying off your water container and, especially fishing. Also ideal dental floss.
 Use it to find water and nearest civilisation.
