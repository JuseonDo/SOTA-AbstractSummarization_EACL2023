 It is fun and easier to make wigs, hats or other hair accessories. It is also easier to place tabs on the doll (if you use tabs).;
, It will last longer that way.
 You can have a lot of fun making yourself a wedding dress or something like that. Use your imagination.
 If you chose not to cut out your doll, lay a piece of paper over your doll (make sure you can see your doll under the paper) and trace around the body to make outfits. Cut out doll when finished making clothes. If you cut out your doll right away, trace around the body again like using the doll as sort of a stencil. Make as many outfits as you want. And accessories too! You can also add tabs to the clothes if you wish. If you decide not to use tabs, try covering your clothes in contact paper like the doll. You can tape the clothes/accessories onto the doll, and reuse the tape a few times.
