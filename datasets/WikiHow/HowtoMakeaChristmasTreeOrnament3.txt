 Cut out the shape to use as a pattern template. A sample for you to trace is shown here but you can draw your own freehand or find an alternative design, as suits your needs.
 Cut out two pieces of green felt following the template pattern.
 Leave a small gap to allow you to stuff the tree shortly. Use small, neat stitches in a color that won't show up against the green felt.
 Make it nice and plump. Then finish off the stitching to keep the stuffing contained.
 Use thin cord or embroidery thread to make the hanging loop.
 Sew on "ornaments" such as sequins, artificial gems, buttons, or other craft items you have spare.
 The felt Christmas tree ornament is now ready to hang up.
