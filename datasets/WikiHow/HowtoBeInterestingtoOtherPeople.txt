, You can fake confidence by standing up straight, holding your head up high and smile a lot. Just be friendly! Once you get use to it, confidence will come naturally.
 If you are not much of a newspaper reader, then go to an online newspaper and just read the headlines, so you can at least say "I heard about that" when someone mentions something they saw or read about. Ananova offers a wonderful news section with weird and strange news tidbits you can discuss with your friends.
 Some hobby ideas are:


Photography is quite cheap these days because everyone has a digital camera somewhere. Make a Flickr or Picasa account and post them on there so you can give the link to your hobby to friends.
Biking
Painting
creative writing
Yoga/Pilate's
Collecting (something other than STAMPS!!!!)
Salsa dancing
Target shooting
Model building
Sailing
Hiking

,, They will want to be part of your life if you are interesting.
 When your friends come to you with a problem or question, maybe you can find the answers in scrapbook. You will seem well rounded.
 Be creative in conversation, think around the corners and surprise friends and family with your responses.
 Subscribe to a "word of the day" email on line and then try to use the new words in conversation daily. People will think you are well schooled, even if you've only ever finished High School.
 Even if you listen to music already, try new styles. If you never listen to Jazz, try some light Jazz. If you never listen rock music, try some!

, Tell your friends about them, rant and rave and go to live performances. Drag your friends along and open their world to new things.
,,,,!

,, Go to a Thai restaurant, or Filipino...try something new and if you like it, next time invite all your friends to go with you.
