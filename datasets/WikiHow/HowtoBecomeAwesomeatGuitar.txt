 Try to find one with a good sound. An equipped guitarist would have a supply of picks, an amp, cables, extra strings, and if you want to make cool sounds and effects, some effects pedals like Distortion or Wah. Or you can get a guitar pack that comes with all the essentials.;
, Practice. Practice. Do you think Jimi Hendrix woke up an amazing guitarist? NO! he practiced, and practiced, and practiced.HE probably practiced hours and hours every day. You practice at least half an hour a day and if you REALLY want to be really good, even more.
 Be able to read the staff, guitar tab, and chord markers well. Though, many great artists out there never did learn how to read music correctly...take Billie Joe from Green Day for an example.
 Look on the internet for some tips, if you don't already, Try to get an advanced guitar player teacher to help you with your playing and practice.
 By practicing a lot, your ability to move your fingers and hit the strings will increase. Your fingers will become stronger. You can also practice finger speed with guitar scales.
, This could help with your chord knowledge (still do it) but you want to do some exercises. Try learning the different scales and just playing through them.
 Experiment with your Amp and your pedals. See what sounds you can make. Try to get a unique sound, "your" sound. Use your whammy bar(if you have one) and use different forms of strumming and playing the notes.
, Do they think your good? Before you start looking for some sort of job as a guitarist, make sure you know and other people know that you can play REALLY well.
