 The biggest boost in regular care is feeding or giving your dogs and/or cats a drink. Feed them as soon as it says 'Normal' or 'Hungry/Thirsty' next to hunger or thirst. 'Normal' and 'Hungry/Thirsty' is the middle - it goes Full/Quenched, Normal, Hungry/Thirsty, and Famished/Parched. This gives you more chances to feed them. If you feed or give them a drink at 'Full/Quenched', they won't take it, making it a complete waste of time and money. If you do it at 'Parched/Famished', you will have to wait ages till that happens.


Note: When doing the above method, buy dry food. It's the most basic, cheapest food you can buy, and you have to admit, doing the above method is going to cost a load of money!

, Walks are a good way to get money, trainer points and getting your dog fit! Just go on walk after walk until you are fed up. (You may need to give your dog some water, food, or a bath after a while but, hey, more trainer points.)


If your dog finds a piece of plastic, rubber, wood, etc., wait until you have enough to make it into something! Then sell the item or keep it. Either way it saves you money! If your dog finds something else in a present, just sell it or keep it. Walks give you trainer points too! If a message pops up telling you that your dog and another dog have made friends and asks if you want to go somewhere to play, say yes! It makes the walk longer and hopefully gives you time to find more gifts!

, You get £50 for coming 3rd and £250 for coming 2nd in the Nintendogs Cup in the trick competition. You can enter 2 competitions of the same type (Trick, Disc and the other one) in one day but you can do more than 2 if they are different types (e.g. 2 trick comps then 1 Disc comp).

,,,,, When you finish the contests, you can do the steps again and as many times you want to do it.
