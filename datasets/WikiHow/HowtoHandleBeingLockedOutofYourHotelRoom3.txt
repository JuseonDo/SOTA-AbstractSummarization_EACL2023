stop and think.

@summary
if no one is available to help, look for a phone or use your cell phone.

@summary
if you cannot find a phone, look for anything you can use to wear.

@summary
look for something to cover yourself up with if nothing else is available.

@summary
if you can't find anything to cover yourself, and there are no other options, use the stairs to reach the front desk and poke your head around the door.

@summary
if there is no door, poke your head around the wall, or whatever is there.

@summary
as a last resort, take a deep breath, put your hands where you need them to be, and run to the receptionist.

 Are you alone on your trip? Is there anyone else staying with you? If there is, go to their room and borrow suitable clothing from them to ask for a key, or have them ask the front desk for you. If a friend or family member is sharing the same room with you, but is not present, call them to come to the hotel and use their key.
 Some hotels have guest phones or payphones in the hallways you can use to call the front desk. Explain the situation, and ask them to send someone up with a key.
 A coat hanging on a door, a bath towel, etc. Go to the front desk wearing this, remembering to return the items once you can get back in your room.
 Be prepared to draw attention when holding up a potted plant or newspaper to yourself, but if it is all you can find, it is necessary.
 Call for someone to help, and explain your situation. Do not use the elevators to get downstairs; you'll want to create as little disturbance as possible.
 Call for security if the front desk isn't nearby, or if someone bothers you.
 If it helps you, pray to God that there is no one else around to see you, and quickly ask them for a key.
