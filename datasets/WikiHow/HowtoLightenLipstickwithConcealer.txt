 The best shades on which this method will work are red, wine, burgundy, deep brown, bright pink, purple, or orange. It is not recommended to try this with black or any other extremely dark lipstick in the blue or black family.;
, It is best if it has a moisturizing texture.
 Add it your palm because this will warm up the concealer and make it easier to blend.
 Make sure it is very close to the concealer in your palm, but not overlapping.
 You can use a Q-tip or a lip brush to achieve this. Make sure it looks blended; it should become one neutral color that is lighter in shade.
 Enjoy the the new color that you have created! Its lighter tone will make for a perfect shade for the daytimeÂ and for days when you want sheer color.
