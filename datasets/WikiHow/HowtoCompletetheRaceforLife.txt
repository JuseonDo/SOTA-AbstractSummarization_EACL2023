, This can be done on the website by following a simple form. You can enter on your own or as a team.
 You can train on your own or with friends.
 You should have a good pair of trainers and loose fitting tops and trousers. Also, remember to buy safety pins so that you can attach your name tag onto your clothing.
 Ask your friends and family to sponsor you.
 If you can, share a lift with somebody else as the venues can get quite crowded and parking can be a nightmare!
