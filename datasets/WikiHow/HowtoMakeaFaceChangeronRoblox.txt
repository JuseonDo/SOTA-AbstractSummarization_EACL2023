You can color any color you'd like but it's recommended to keep it yellow to see the face image properly.
 Under "Search," there should be a grey rectangle that says "Models" with a small arrow next to it. Click the arrow and something like this should pop up. Click "Decals.", Search "Faces" to find something for your Face Changer.

If you can't find anything you like, just simply go to the Catalog and find the name of a face you like. Some people have edited the faces and made them something entirely new.
 Just save and publish to your friends or add to a set. If you make many Face Changers, you can put them together, group them,and make one big Face Changer model everyone will be sure to love.
