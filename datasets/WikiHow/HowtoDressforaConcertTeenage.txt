dress for the occasion.

shoes are important.

@summary
don't take a bag/man purse, they won't be needed and things will get broken, essentials only; money, id, phone.

@summary
now to the important bit the clothes!,

@summary
at any concert it gets really, really hot so you don't want to be wearing something that you're not going to be comfortable in.

@summary
music festivals are often a big sweat pile, it sounds gross, but it's more fun when you're there.

@summary
no makeup.

@summary
accessories are sometimes the norm at concerts, for techno/house concerts glow in the dark zinc and glow arm bands are always fun.

@summary
keep it simple.

 Example: band T's are not good for techno/house concerts.;
, Unless you are going to a concert with assigned seating never wear open toed shoes, thongs/sandals, or high heels unless you want to have a broken bone. Shoes shouldn't be worn just because they're cute. If they're hurting your feet, switch them.
, For guys jeans or denim shorts are always good with a T-shirt.. For a girl, jeans or denim shorts are awesome and can be worn anywhere. These are essential as you don't want to have permanent spill stains beer, soft drink, water, etc. on your clothes.
 For a techno/pop concert, go in a tank top or singlet or plain coloured t-shirt. For a rock concert you could were the following: definitely the band t, essential, comfy and tasteful.
 For girls wear a bikini or dark coloured bra underneath a button up t-shirt that's a bit big, this will be good to undo/tie up as needed.
 It isn't needed at concerts, people sweat and it will drip off, it's not fun. If you don't feel comfortable without it, or want to wear it make sure you go for powder foundations and light eye make up with lip gloss or plain lipstick.
 Just don't go too over the top and paint your entire face with armbands up to your elbows.. you will look like a fool.
 Up to date t-shirt styles are always great, team it with denim shorts/jeans and sneaker style shoes.
