 If you have some remaining battery power and wish to charge your PSP using a USB cord rather than an AC Adapter, you can do this by adjusting the settings on your PSP.


Even if the proper setting is already turned on, the PSP must be powered on to use USB charging.
Note: This method is NOT supported by the first generation PSP models (series 1000).Games cannot be played while using USB charging.
 Settings can be accessed by scrolling left from the opening menu.
 Scroll down in the “Settings” menu to access the system settings.
 This option appears in the System Settings menu and will activate the ability to charge by USB.
 This option is located in the same menu just below “USB Charge”., The mini USB outlet is located on the top of your device.


The PSP uses a 5 pin Mini-B USB port. Any USB cable that fits this spec will work., You can connect this end of the cable to a computer or an electrical outlet with a USB wall adapter.


If you are connecting your mini USB cord to your computer instead of an electrical outlet, then both the laptop and the PSP need to be powered on in order for the charge to take place.
 The power light will display a blinking green light at first, then turns solid orange, indicating a proper connection. If the light never turns orange, double-check that the AC adapter is plugged in correctly and that the battery pack at the back of the PSP is installed properly.
 USB charging is slower than using an AC adapter. A longer wait will fully charge your PSP, allowing for longer sessions of use.
