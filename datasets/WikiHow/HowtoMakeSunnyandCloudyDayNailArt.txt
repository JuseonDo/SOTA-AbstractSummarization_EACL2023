, First put a horizontal tape and then cover the remaining sides of nails with the help of transparent tape. Doing so will prevent the skin around nails from any nail colour.
 Take dark blue colour and apply it on the sponge & then take sky blue colour and apply on the sponge just below the dark blue colour.
 Take the sponge and gently press it on the nail in such a way that it transfers these colors onto the nail as shown in video. Once this dries up apply a transparent shimmer coat.
 Take yellow color nail paint and draw a shining sun at the corner of nail. With black color, make the eyes and mouth of sun. Now to make clouds, take white nail polish and make three clouds in a scattered fashion on the nail.
