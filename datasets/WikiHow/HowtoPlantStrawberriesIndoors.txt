 Make sure it is not too squishy and are ripe.;
, Quickly flick your wrist to get the seed out. You need to use a flicking motion because strawberry seeds move fast, and if you try to push it out, you'll just dig a hole in your strawberry.
 Collect as many as you think you'll need but a good amount is around 20-30 seeds, to ensure that at least one takes.
, It should be damp, not dripping wet. Take the tip of the toothpick and poke a couple of your seeds, they should stick onto the toothpick without falling off.
 Flick the top of the toothpick (not the seeds) with your middle or forefinger. The strawberry seeds should fall off and scatter into the cup.


Do not push the seeds down.
, Add two thirds hydrogen peroxide.
 Dip the toothpick in this solution. Then drip some of the solution over the seeds. This will help them grow, as hydrogen peroxide is a natural oxidizer.


Note: You do not need to do this every day––every other day is fine until the seeds have sprouted, then once a week is all you need.
 Don't overdo the watering or the seeds will drown and can turn moldy. Keep the soil moist but not wet, watering about once or twice a week.
, In a few days, the seeds should have sprouted. If enough plants take, you can transplant them after a few weeks, into separate pots.
 When the plants grow large enough, fruit will form and the plant should be sprouting some yummy strawberries for you to eat.
