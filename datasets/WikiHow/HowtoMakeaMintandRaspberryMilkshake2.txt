 Trickle the raspberry sauce all around the inside edge of the glass, for taste and decoration purposes. You will want to use a fair amount of sauce so that there is a puddle at the bottom of the glass.
 The raspberry sauce should still stick to the outside. Gently stir the milkshake.
 Get a straw and enjoy.
