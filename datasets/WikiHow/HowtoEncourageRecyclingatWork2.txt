encourage employees to begin recycling at work and at home for an even bigger reward.
@article



Making office recycling like a game, at least to begin with, may get those who might not have otherwise been interested involved. Everyone likes a challenge and offering an incentive just ups the ante. Gift cards, movie tickets, or even just a candy bar make great rewards. The incentive doesn't have to be outrageous in order for employees to be interested.



People who already recycle at home may be at an advantage, which may push other employees even harder to get involved.
