 To make this contraption, simply line the wok with foil.
, Lay the fresh salmon on top of it (fillets or whole fish).
 Fold more foil right over the lid to seal it to the wok.
 Cook for about 5 minutes, then lower the heat.
 Check halfway to see how the fish is going.
 Any uneaten portions must be refrigerated and eaten with a day or two. Do not leave the smoky fish sitting at room temperature for any extended period. It is not smoked, just smoky in flavor.
