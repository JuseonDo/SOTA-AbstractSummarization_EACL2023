 Patched and painted internal walls are a sure sign of a cover up, as are external walls concealed behind plants or trellis.;
, It can rise from the ground, come down from the roof or seep out through internal walls due to plumbing problems. You might smell it before you see it, or it may be hidden behind a coat of paint or furniture pushed against the walls.
 Watch out for floor damage that's been patched and concealed under carpet, crumbly skirting boards, or weather boards and window sills that have been patched and painted.
 Not many people look at their roof on a regular basis so watch for rusty metal that has been painted, tiles patched with lead or damaged roof framing propped up in the roof space.
 Check for damp that will affect timber sub-floor or stumps, or floors that are temporarily propped to prevent bouncing.
 These can be costly to replace so make sure you don't have any rust that's been painted over.
 These need to be professionally checked and replaced or repaired immediately.
