, The Taurus Demon should be waiting below by now.
,, After you finish the attack, you'll find you're stuck between the fog door and the demon himself. If you roll quickly through the Taurus Demon's legs, you'll be able to escape without taking damage. If you have time, you can also quickly slash his legs as you run by. Do not try to climb immediately back up the ladder as the Taurus Demon will hit you before you can finish climbing it.
 The Taurus Demon will be following you quickly, so when you reach the end of the bridge, you need to the again roll through his legs and run back to the first guard tower.
 It is a more difficult method overall as you will be within the reach of the demon more often than the firebomb method, but the large chunks of health you remove with plunging attacks will not only make the fight quicker, but allows you to save your firebombs for other enemies.
