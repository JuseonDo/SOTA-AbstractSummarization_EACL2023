For the second coat, use Italian breadcrumbs, or add herbs such as herbes de Provence to plain breadcrumbs.
If you have grated Parmesan cheese available, add it to the second coat.
 Using a fork, place each chop into the egg mixture, then into the flour mixture, coating well.
 This will create a thicker coating that is crunchy and lovely to eat. Kids especially like it.
 Cook until brown, around 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over and cook the other side for an additional 3 minutes, or until brown.
