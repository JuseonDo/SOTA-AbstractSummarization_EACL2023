 To begin making your breakfast tortilla, place a napkin in a bowl such as a cereal bowl. The napkin will prevent the tortilla from sticking to the bowl and potentially ripping.
 Make sure that the tortilla overlaps the edges of the bowl., Mix the eggs together, stirring carefully so that the bottom of the tortilla doesn't rip.,, Heat the food for one to two minutes in the microwave., Let the bowl stand for five minutes to allow the egg to finish cooking., The tortilla should have hardened into the shape of the bowl.,
