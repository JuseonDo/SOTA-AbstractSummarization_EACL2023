@summary
apply mulch to the area around your tree, using bark mulch or wood chips.

@summary
do not pile mulch around the base of tree; pull mulch back several inches leaving only a thin layer around the base.
@article
 The layer of mulch should be 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) thick. Mulching will reduce competition from grass, reduce weeds, hold moisture, protect the base of your tree from lawn equipment, and help maintain a constant soil temperature.
 Mulching out to the drip line of the tree is ideal, but any mulching is helpful. Of course
