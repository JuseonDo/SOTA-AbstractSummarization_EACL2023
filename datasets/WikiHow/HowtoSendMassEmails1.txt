 This method is best for small lists of 100 emails or less. You should ensure you have some personal knowledge of each of these people so that you aren’t accused of “spamming” people with email.;
, If so, copy all the emails or select them one by one to add them to the group. If not, you can copy all the email into the “BCC,” or blind copy, line.
 If you have created a group list, type the name of the list into your “CC” line or your blind copy line. Use “CC” only if you want everyone else to see the other emails and reply to the entire list.
