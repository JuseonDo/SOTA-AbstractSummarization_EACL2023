 While the "pod-" verb stem seems to indicate regular conjugation for the verb poder in future tense, the ending differs from the regular conjugation of -er verbs.If you're familiar with the conjugation of regular -er verbs, you know that the first-person singular ending is -eré. With all future forms of poder, though, you don't want to add that first "e."

, Particularly when in Spain, conjugate poder this way to use the informal second-person pronoun tú., If you are talking about a third person or an object being able in the future, use this conjugation with the appropriate pronoun. Remember objects have gender in Spanish.Use the same form for the first-person singular pronoun usted., To form the first-person plural form of the verb poder in future tense, drop the -er from the verb stem "pod-" and add the ending "-remos.", Particularly in Spain, you might use the pronoun "vosotros" to talk to a group of people informally. Only use this form if you would address every person in the group individually as "tú.""Vosotros podréis" can be roughly translated as "you will be able" or "you will have the power" in English.
 When talking about something a group will be able to do in the future, this conjugation is appropriate. Use "ellos" for a mixed-gender group.Use the same conjugation for the second-person plural pronoun ustedes.
