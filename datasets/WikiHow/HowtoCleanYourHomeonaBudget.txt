,, Choose regular microfiber cloths in different colours so you can use a different one for each room. Simply wash and re-use these cloths.
 These are the three key cleaning products you will need throughout the entire house. Use vinegar to disinfect surfaces and to clean mirrors. Use baking soda to clean surfaces, remove stains, deodorize, scrub pots and pans, and more (for a few ideas, see tips below).
 These convenient wants have disposable cleaning heads pre-filled with a cleaning solution. For a more environmentally friendly option, use a regular non-disposable toilet brush.
