@summary
long before you get up to bat, you need to study the pitcher when he is warming up, just like any other pitcher.

@summary
find out if the pitcher throws with their right or left hand.

@summary
keep in mind that while side-armers are usually very accurate, they also tend to hit more batters than other pitchers because throwing side arm is almost as tough as hitting against a side arm pitcher!,

@summary
when up to bat, always watch the first pitches to see where they will land.

@summary
after you face a side armer once, you will realize that they are just like other pitchers and that if you are not fooled by the angle, you will hit the ball.

 There are variations to side arm pitching, so watch carefully at the angle he releases the ball. Watch how fast he throws so you can time it right. Side-armers tend to throw a lot of curves and sliders, so watch for those as well.;
, If you have a right handed pitcher and a right handed batter, from the batter's perspective, it will look like the ball is heading right for you after the release. It will then move over the plate and typically land just outside the strike zone. For a righty-lefty match-up, it will look like the ball is very far outside just after he releases it. It will move in towards you at the end. Lefty versus lefty basically is the same as a righty-righty match-up, explained above. Hitting against a pitcher with the same dominant hand is harder because the ball looks as if it will hit you.
 Almost every side arm pitch looks as if it will hit you at one time or another, but if one really looks like it will hit you, turn around and stand your ground, letting the pitch hit your back. This will not hurt as much, if it hurts at all, as getting hit by an overhand pitcher because side arm pitchers do not throw as fast.
 Side arm pitchers are deceptive, yet usually very, very, accurate. Chances are the second pitch will be thrown to the exact same spot as the first. Now you want to swing at the third pitch, especially if the first two were strikes. Even though the ball will look wild, aim for the same spot that the first two landed. With the best precision (and lots of practice), you will hit the ball.
