 It doesn't have to be too fancy, though. A regular personal organizer is clean, neat and always has a title.;
, It looks very mature.
 Repeat it everyday or make a new one for each day. It is your decision. Make sure it's very neat. Use rulers if you want to make the schedule in a table or a chart. If it includes diagrams or anything complicated, do it in pencil.
, You can't glue the calculators, so try stapling them with a sharped-front stapler.
 Then you can bring the organizer to school and see which lessons you have next and at what time.
 It always comes in useful. Take a different piece of paper and write down a list of what snack and what time. Also write down the time when you have breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you want to make diagrams, flow-charts, tables or anything else, then you can. It's best if you make a checklist.
 It's the most important thing to do when you have an organizer.
 For example, you can make a special page of "friendship" and glue pictures of your friends and their names underneath. Be creative.
 If there is a mistake, rub it in white ink if its in pen, if not, then rub it with an eraser. Try not to get the organizer too fat. If the book is filled up, get another book. Staple them together or just have them separate.
