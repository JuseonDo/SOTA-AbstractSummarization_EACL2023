@summary
begin by installing all of the packages required for compilation.

@summary
accept the yes/no prompt.

@summary
navigate to your home folder, cd /home/yourusername.

@summary
now you must download the source code for the trinity server.

@summary
go to the new directory named "trinitycore" with cd trinitycore and create a new folder named "build" with mkdir build.

@summary
configure the build process with the cmake command.

@summary
begin the build process with the make command.

@summary
when the process is done, it should look like the image on the right.

@summary
,

@summary
type the command make install.

@summary
now that you have built the server program, you must retrieve the game data from world of warcraft itself.

@summary
go to the "extractor" directory and find "ad.exe".

@summary
go to the "vmap_extract_assembler_bin" directory and copy all the present files to the wow root directory.

@summary
now that you have the server and the data, you need a database to store the players and creatures.

@summary
go to the /home/yourusername/db/trunk directory.

@summary
create three new databases, "world", "characters" and "realmd".extract the "full_database/tdb0.0.2.rar(tc1) or tdb0.0.3(tc2)" and execute the "tdblatestversion.sql" to the world database.

@summary
go to the /home/yourusername/src/trinitycore/sql/updates directory.

@summary
add a new row to the table "realmlist" in the realmd database.

@summary
go to the /home/yourusername/bin/etc directory.

@summary
scroll down a bit until you find the "realmid" option.

@summary
find the "databaseinfo" options, a few rows down.

@summary
find, under "performance settings" the "vmap.enablelos" and "vmap.enableheight" options.

@summary
open the "trinityrealm.conf" file.explore the different options in the files, and set them to your liking.

@summary
when you are done, open a terminal window to /home/yourusername/bin/bin and type the command ./trinity-core.

@summary
you now have a working trinity server!,now that your server is up and running, you will want to learn how to properly update it.shut down the server by pressing ctrl+c in the terminal windows.

@summary
open a terminal, and go to the /home/yourusername/src/trinitycore directory.repeat steps 5-9.

@summary
go to the /home/yourusername/src/trinitycore/sql/updates directory, and apply all new sql files to their corresponding databases.

@summary
go to the /home/yourusername/db/trunk/updates directory.

@summary
now your server and database are updated.
@article
 These are easily installed with this command: sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libace-dev libmysql++-dev subversion mercurial openssl libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libmysqlclient15-dev libtool mysql-client unrar.;
, This will install the packages to your computer.
 Make three folders, named bin, src and db. The commands are mkdir bin, mkdir src and mkdir db.
 Go to the "src" directory with CD src and type the command hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/KingPin/trinitycore/ For TC1 (2.4.3) or hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/KingPin/trinitycore2/ for TC2 (3.0.9).
 Go to the build directory with cd build.
 There are several ways to configure the process, but this guide will assume that you are using MySQL for the server's database needs and that you want the default configuration. Type the command cmake ../ -DPREFIX=/home/yourusername/bin.
 If you want the build process to go faster, you can first type make genrev and then make -j3 or make -j5. This works best on dual-core processors and quad-core processors respectively.
, This will copy the necessary executable files to the /home/yourusername/bin directory.
 There are a number of tools in the "src/trinitycore/contrib/" directory that serve this purpose.
 copy it to the WoW root directory (example: C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\) and run it. Copy the two new directories, "dbc" and "maps" to the /home/yourusername/bin/bin/ directory on the Linux computer. Check your hard drive space before running ad.exe, however. The program requires at least 1.5GB of space before running., Run the file "makevmaps_SIMPLE.bat" and copy the new directory "vmaps" to the /home/yourusername/bin/bin/ directory on the Linux computer. Remove the "buildings" directory. Remember, makevmaps takes even more hard drive space than ad.exe, it requires at least 2GB., Go to your home directory with cd /home/yourusername and type the command svn checkout http://svn.assembla.com/svn/trinitydatabase/ db.
 This directory contains SQL dumps that must be inserted into the MySQL database. This guide will not provide any examples of inserting SQL queries. You may, of course, use whatever MySQL interface you prefer.
 Execute the script "characters.sql" in the characters database and execute the script "realmd.sql" in the realmd database. Both of these can be obtained from the src/trinitycore/sql directory.,, These files are called core updates. They must be applied to their corresponding databases in the correct order from number 1098 and up(TC1) or 1733 and up(TC2).
 Make the id 1, name servername, address externalipaddress, port 8085, icon 0, color 0, timezone 8, allowedSecurityLevel 0, population 0., The two files in here act as configuration files for the server. They must be renamed to work, so remove the trailing ".dist" at the end of the filename.(If they don't have the .dist extension, you need to turn off the "hide extensions for known filetypes" option (google it) Now open the file "trinitycore.conf"., Make sure it is the same as you just put in the database.
 These must be set to the username and password of your MySQL database. Replace the ";trinity;trinity;" with ";username;password;"., These must be changed from 0 to 1., Fix the "DatabaseInfo" options as you did in the previous file.,, Do the same again except type ./trinity-realm., To connect with your WoW client, simply access the file "realmlist.wtf" in the WoW root directory (2.4.3) or World of Warcraft\Data\{locale} (enUS or enGB for example)(3.0.9) and change it's contents to "set realmlist computeripaddress". When you connect with your client, it should connect to the Trinity server!,,, Type the command hg pull and then hg update.(This can also be done in one step by using hg pull -u) This will download the latest source code.
, If you were previously on revision 1312, and a file that begins with 1313 is present, apply it and everything above. It is advisable to keep note of the latest file before doing step 31., Apply the new files named "updatepack" in ascending numerical order to the world database. Ignore the "corepatch" files.
 Simply start the binaries and enjoy.
