 Look for signs such as movement, or clusters of eggs. It may help to use a magnifying glass.;
, Check them carefully before purchasing or bringing them home.
 Provide enough space so that mites cannot easily move from plant to plant. A few inches or centimeters will be far enough.
 Also, keep the humidity high (if using a greenhouse).
, This will prevent bugs and insects from entering.
 Discard or burn these plants; do not compost them as this will spread the disease.
 Place these around your pots.
 It is important that you introduce them before there is a large infestation, so that they can adequately control it.
 Destroy them by squishing or drowning. This works with only very mild cases of infestation.
 Be careful to not spray them onto another plant.
 Repeat this application every few days. The spray will not destroy eggs so you must continue to apply to kill all the hatched mites.
 Repeat this application every 4 to 5 days.



You can make your own insecticidal soap as follows: Mix together 2 tablespoons of liquid dish soap, 4 oz. ethyl alcohol (use the cheapest vodka you can find) and 12-16 oz. water. Transfer the resulting solution to a spray bottle. Spray on the tomato plants. You'll find that it works on other insects too.
 Place 1 oz. (28.4 g) of garlic in a blender with 2 to 3 oz. (57 to 85 g) of onion, 1 oz. (28.4 g) of cloves, 1 oz. (28.4 g) of cayenne pepper and 1 cup (237 ml) of water. Blend to combine. Add this mixture to 1 gallon (3.79 l) of room-temperature water and spray 3 times over 5 days. This is a preventative measure but will also kill young mites.
 This will suffocate the mites but won't damage the plants.
 Follow the directions on the label for safety measures.
