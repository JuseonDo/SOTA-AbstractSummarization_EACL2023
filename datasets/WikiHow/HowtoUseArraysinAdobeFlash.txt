, Once you have initialised your array you will want to add some items to it. As this is a collection of items you need to add a number to your array to specifically pick the item to access Like in other languages you append square brackets with a number in side them.
 To use the items you just added to your array just call the array name with the index of the item you want to access.
 Push is another way of saying add items to your array each item will be added to the end of your array. You can push one item at a time or multiple items.
