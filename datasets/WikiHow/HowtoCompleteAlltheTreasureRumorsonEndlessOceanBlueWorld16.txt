 (You need to complete the 7th part of the "The Best Trainer"-request, and befriend the Amazon River Dolphin to move the branches out of the way and complete this map.), You will have to dive at night. Go to the area of all the mangroves, near the part where to go to the upstream part of the river. Look here, it's a little difficult to find, but it should come up as a sphere.,
