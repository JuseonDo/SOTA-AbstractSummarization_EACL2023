 This method is best used when there are a few individual bent pins. You will want a mechanical pencil with a .5 or .7 millimeter opening. These sizes should fit comfortably around a CPU pin.
 You need the opening to be free of obstructions.
 Carefully maneuver the tip to bend the pin back into place. You can use the angle of the pencil as a guide to track how straight the pin is.
