 An example could be to: proofread professionally for a large financial printer/publisher. And, since reliable is a synonym for infallible, then although infallibility/perfection may not be possible -- that is a necessary goal toward which to work.


Be relied upon by others such as a court, judge and jury. A jury is called the reasonable man when they attend to, deliberate and decide guilt or innocence, awards and punishments. Avoid the devastating failure of "unreliable" personnel being relied upon which may lead to errors, failures, crashes, possible deaths. The opposite of reliable is deceptive, irresponsible, unreliable, untrustworthy, unsure, uncertain, ie: unqualified.;
, Both formal and informal education are important. All successful men self-teach, but formal education is becoming more highly regarded today, and can serve as motivation.
 This requires diligence and much practise. Prepare an emergency plan, and be expert in that area as well as work and play areas.
 Planning and procedure manuals, accounting books and software or tools for productivity, computer programs and procedures in the processes of your work must be aligned or designed to fit your area of expertise.
 Bring yourself and all members of a faculty, surgery team, nurse staff, training corps, secretaries and clerk assistants, sport team coaches and team skills in line. Keep them at as high a level of competency as possible, as they must be (to be reliable).
