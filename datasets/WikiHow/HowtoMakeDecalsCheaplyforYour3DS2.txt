 Most paints are not good news if you eat them.
 This time it's a good idea to do a dry run on some paper or waste plastic when you're ready.
 If you can't make one, print out a template from the internet. This saves time and more importantly, money.
, For best results with a spray, cover as much of the room up as possible, or do it outside. Then go hell for leather. For best results with a brush, do things slowly, with care, and don't get distracted.
 It usually says how long on the can, but if you aren't convinced, leave overnight in a dry place at room temperature and return in the morning.
 The necessary equipment leaves marks, the stripper damages the electronics and the eBay value just skyrocketed on your one-of a-kind hand-painted 3DS. Not that you'd ever sell it.
