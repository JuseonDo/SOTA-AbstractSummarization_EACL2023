,, Do this by pressing and holding:





(blue),





(gold),





(red),





(green) after you select OK after choosing your Mii. Holding any of these buttons will change the ball to the colour shown.
 After your skill level reaches 1000+, you will get a special, diamond-pattern ball.
 Bowl the ball incorrectly, by releasing it when you are still swinging it backwards. The crowd will jump and spin around, and scream.
 Move as far right as you can, press the A button, and move as far right as you can with that. When you release B, your ball will be released into another alley and the crowd will be laughing.

 After you beat the champion boxer, Matt, when the screen goes black after pressing "Play Again", press 1 and you will have silver boxing gloves.
