 When you are done, place it onto a plate lined with paper towels so that the grease can drain., This will be the outside of your sandwich. It will help make your sandwich extra crispy and prevent it from sticking to the skillet.
 You can spread one thick layer onto one slice or bread, or a thin layer onto both slices. Make sure that you are putting the mayo onto the unbuttered side, and not the buttered side.
 If you don't like guacamole, you can leave it out, or you can use a few thin slices of avocado instead. At this point, you can also add some salt and pepper.


The lettuce may lose some of its crispy texture after you grill the sandwich. If you don't want this, wait until after you grill the sandwich; simply open up the sandwich, and pop the lettuce in, then close it.
 Gently press down on your sandwich to "seal" it. Again, make sure that the buttered side is on top, as this will help keep your sandwich from sticking to the skillet.
 Place a skillet on the stove, and turn the heat up to medium. When the skillet gets hot enough, put the sandwich on and grill it for 2 to 3 minutes.
 Slide a spatula under the sandwich, and carefully flip it over onto the other side. Continue cooking it until it turns golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes., This will make the sandwich easier to handle so that it doesn't fall apart.
 Put the sandwiches on a plate and serve it promptly. If you'd like to go the extra step, put a frilled sandwich or cocktail pick in the center of each one to hold it together.
