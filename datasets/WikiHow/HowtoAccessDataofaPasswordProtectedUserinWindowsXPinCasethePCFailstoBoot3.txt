 If you feel comfortable handling computer hardware and have another computer available, you can have full access to the information by connecting the hard disk to another computer. This section assumes that you have some basic knowledge of computer hardware.
 Pull out the power, monitor cables, PS/2 and USB devices, the speakers, etc. All cables and external devices must be removed.

 Copy the information you want to save.
