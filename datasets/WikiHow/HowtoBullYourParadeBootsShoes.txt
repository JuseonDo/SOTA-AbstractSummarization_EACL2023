 You will need some water, and a cloth (anything you can use to remove any dirt off of your boots without damaging the leather).;
, Use a brand new polishing cloth to dry and clean all dust off of the boots.
 After the boots are cleaned you need a good polish which is the exact same colour as the leather, and another polishing cloth, as well as a polish remover brush.
, You may wish to do your other boot while the polish is drying.
 Your aim is not to remove the polish but to give a lovely shine. Only brush in one direction.
, Use a tiny amount of water in circular motions on the toe of your boot using one finger.
 Place on the toe of the boot and move quickly from side to side.
 If the shine is not what desired repeat the polishing part of the process until desired shine is achieved.
