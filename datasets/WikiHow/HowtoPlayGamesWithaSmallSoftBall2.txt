note/s: this one can get a bit annoying after a while, so make sure you stay calm.

put your legs together while sitting down.

make sure you catch your ball quickly if it falls forwards, as someone may take it, as it rolls away from you!

 Don't do this near a surface with holes in, otherwise you may lose your ball. You must be wearing shorts or a dress for this one. Trousers are perfect too.
 Your knees should be bent and your legs should be completely straight. Roll the ball down your legs and when it reaches your knee, flick your knees backwards. When the ball hits your chest, trap it with your chin. It's really hard!

, This one takes A LOT of practice to make perfect!
