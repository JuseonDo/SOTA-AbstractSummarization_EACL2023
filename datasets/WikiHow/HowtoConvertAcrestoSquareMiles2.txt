By definition a square miles is square, but an acre can be any shape., This number will probably already be given to you, but you can also use an area calculator map to determine the acreage of a real-world tract of land.For example, you might want to convert 2,500 acres to square miles.
 To put it another way, each acre is 0.0015625 of a mile.

The decimal comes from dividing 1 by 640. So, you could also multiply by 1640{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{640}}}.

You can multiply using a calculator, or, if you’re feeling ambitions, by hand.

For example, to convert 2,500 acres into square miles, you would calculate 2500×0.0015625=3.90625mi2{\displaystyle 2500\times 0.0015625=3.90625\;mi^{2}}.
