;
,,, Roll it into a circle, leaving 1-1/2" (4 cm) between the edge of the dough and the edge of the pan so that the cookie can expand.
 Check the dough after the cooking time has elapsed. If the edges are too brown and the center is underdone, cover the edges with aluminum foil and continue baking the cookie until the center is set.
 Spread buttercream frosting over the cooled surface of the cookie using an offset spatula. Sprinkle the frosting with crushed cookie crumbs to create the "dirt" for your graveyard.
 This icing will serve as a glaze that you can use to decorate your cookies.
 Put 2/3 of the icing in one bowl and 1/3 of the icing in another bowl. The smaller quantity is icing that you will dye black for lettering and other decorations.


If you don't have black food coloring, mix 1 teaspoon of red, 1 teaspoon of yellow and 3 teaspoons of blue food coloring in a separate bowl. Then, add it to the icing that you've set aside for lettering.






Use a pastry bag with a 3/4" (2 cm) tip for decorating with the icing.
 These will serve as the gravestones and ghosts in your graveyard. Use some of these ideas for inspiration:


Cover ghost-shaped cookies with white icing. Outline the cookie with icing and let it dry. Fill in the cookie with squiggles of white icing. Use a toothpick to spread the icing squiggles flat so that they cover the surface of the cookie. Let them dry and add black dots for eyes.






Write "R.I.P." in white icing on top of chocolate-covered rectangular cookies. If your cookies are light in color, use black icing for the lettering. You can also make smaller gravestones by cutting round cookies in half.






Cover cat-shaped cookies in black icing and give them two white eyes. You can do the same with bat-shaped cookies, and you can add fangs.
 Set them upright in the buttercream frosting to create your spooky graveyard. Sprinkle Halloween candies or sprinkles over the top of the frosting, if desired.
