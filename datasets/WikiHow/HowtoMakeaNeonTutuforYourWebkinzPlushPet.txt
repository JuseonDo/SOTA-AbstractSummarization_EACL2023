 For the best results, it should be fairly short, allowing it to puff out like a tutu. However, make sure that it is long enough to be noticeable on a fluffy pet.
 When putting together the tutu, you will fold it in half, so make sure you cut it double the length., Since the elastic size and ribbon thickness will vary, you'll need to guesstimate the exact amount you'll need as you go. Keep one piece of ribbon as the original template, so that you can make more if needed.,, Make a loop, then pull the end piece through the loop. Tighten it and knot in place., Make the knots right alongside each other if you can., Test to see how the tutu looks on your Webkinz toy every once in a while.,,
