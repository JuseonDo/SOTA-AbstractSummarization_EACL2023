get some of your friends, neighbors and family to come over and take part in the fun.

 Have them wear creepy costumes and pose as decorations, then ambush the guests with ghastly acting in the walkway to your house, and inside the house.

 If the early guests are willing to scare people, jump out at them as they arrive.
