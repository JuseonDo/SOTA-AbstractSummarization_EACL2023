@summary
you can leave this hanging for a while, or you can follow the traditional process- if it's sunny, bring it a golden bell, and if it's rainy/cloudy, cut its head off.

 It should be about the size of the span of your hand, and not stiff or thick. Cotton or chiffon are great choices, since they also handle ink well compared to silk.
 Roll this in to a ball and place it in the centre of your piece of fabric. Do not use beans or rice as stuffing as you would with soft toys, because this will be hung, and you don't want it being heavy or spilling over the floor., Tie a piece of wool, ribbon, twine, fishing line or embroidery thread just under this ball, creating a shape like a ball with fabric splayed underneath. Leave plenty of string so you can hang it up later., This is traditionally a smile, but it really can be anything you like. Use a felt tipped pen or Sharpie, rather than a ballpoint., It should face a window.,
