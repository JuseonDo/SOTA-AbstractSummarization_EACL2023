, It is on the third floor of the castle, in the same type of door that the first two bowser battles were in, and on the same floor as Tick Tock Clock, Rainbow ride, and the secret level Wing Mario Over the Rainbow., You have to get behind him, grab his tail, spin him around using the control stick on your controller, and throw him into a bomb located on the side of the arena., He'll most likely spin around to keep track of you so that he can attack in your direction, but don't be alarmed., His most commonly used attack is his fire breath. When he does this attack, he faces one direction and keeps facing that direction as he breathes the fire. This is the perfect opportunity for you to maneuver around him and grab his tail with B., Remember that the more speed you gain, the farther he'll fly. However, it'll be harder to aim if you move too fast. This is perfected with practice., If he falls off, he'll come back up, and break a piece off of the side of the arena. Watch for the shockwaves that will also be on the ground, and try avoiding them by jumping over them. This is easier if you are farther away from where Bowser lands.,,, Don't worry, it's still possible to defeat him at this point.,, Mario will then be wearing a wing cap. Now, enjoy the ending sequence and celebrate beating the final boss of Super Mario 64!
