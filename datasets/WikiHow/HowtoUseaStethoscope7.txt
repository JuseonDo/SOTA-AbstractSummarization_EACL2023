@summary
wrap the blood pressure cuff around your patient’s arm, right above the elbow.

@summary
press the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the brachial artery just below the cuff's edge.

@summary
inflate the cuff to 180mmhg or 30mm above your expected systolic blood pressure.you can find the reading by looking at the sphygmomanometer, which is the gauge on the blood pressure cuff.

@summary
listen for korotkoff sounds.

@summary
release and remove the cuff.

@summary
wait a few minutes if you want to check the patient’s blood pressure again.

 Roll up your patient’s sleeve if it is in the way.Make sure that you use a blood pressure cuff that fits your patient’s arm. You should be able to wrap the cuff around your patient’s arm so that it is snug, but not too tight. If the blood pressure cuff is too small or too large, get a different size., You can also use the diaphragm if you have trouble hearing with the bell. You will be listening for Korotkoff sounds, which are low tone knocking sounds that indicate the patient’s systolic blood pressure.Find your pulse in your inner arm to help you determine where your brachial artery is located., Then, release air from the cuff at a moderate rate (3mm/sec). As yyou release the air, listen with the stethoscope and keep your eyes on the sphygmomanometer (gauge on the blood pressure cuff)., The first knocking sound that you hear is your patient’s systolic blood pressure. Note that number, but keep watching the sphygmomanometer. After the first sound stops, note the number that it stops on. That number is the diastolic pressure., Deflate and take the blood pressure cuff off of your patient right after you have gotten the second number.When you are done, you should have two numbers that make up your patient’s blood pressure. Record these numbers side by side, separated by a slash. For example, 110/70., You may want to re-measure if the patient’s blood pressure is high.A systolic blood pressure above 120 or a diastolic blood pressure above 80 indicates that your patient may have high blood pressure. In that case, your patient should seek further evaluation by a doctor.
