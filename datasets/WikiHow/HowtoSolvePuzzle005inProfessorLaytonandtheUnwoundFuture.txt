The door to the clock shop is locked.
On the other side, you hear a voice.
"Tap on the panel with a timepiece.";
,, Because the obvious clock on the right is in 4 panels, that is not what you're looking for.
 Ask yourself, "What tells time?" or "What objects show that time has passed by?". These are a few examples.


Analog clock
Astronomy
Digital clock
Hourglass
Shadow
Stopwatch
Sundial
Water clock
