 The only way to turn your Mac into a wireless hotspot is to connect it to the network via Ethernet. You cannot create a wireless network if you're using your wireless adapter to connect.


If your Mac does not have an Ethernet adapter, you'll need to use a USB Ethernet dongle.
 You'll find this in the upper-left corner of the screen.


, This is at the end of the third section in the System Preferences window.


If System Preferences does not open to the main screen, click the "Show All" button at the top of the window. This button has 12 small dots.
 The "Internet Sharing" option can be found towards the bottom of the list of "Services" on the left side of the window. Don't check the box yet, just highlight the "Internet Sharing" menu option.
 This will display the different network connections on your Mac.
 This will set Internet Sharing to share your Ethernet connection with other devices.


"Ethernet" may have a slightly different name depending on your Mac model.
"Ethernet" will not appear if you don't have an Ethernet cable connected to your computer. You cannot wirelessly share a wireless connection.
 This will enable other devices to connect to your hotspot via Wi-Fi.
 This will allow you to change your hotspot settings.
 This information will be required when other devices attempt to connect.
 This will turn on your Mac's new wireless hotspot, allowing other devices to connect to it.
 Once your wireless hotspot is active, you can connect to it from your other devices. Your new network will appear in the list of available networks on nearby devices, and the password you created will grant access to the internet.The other devices will not be able to access the files on your computer.
