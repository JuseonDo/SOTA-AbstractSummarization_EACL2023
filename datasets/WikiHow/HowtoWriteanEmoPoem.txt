 Or you can make up a topic of your own experiences if the other ones don't seem to be inspiring.;
,, Try to make it flow, like music.
 It will be shorter than the main parts of your poem. Here is an example:


So I lie in the darkness, words buzzin' in my head, buzzin' in my head, thoughts of emptiness and death, buzzin' in my head, buzzin' in my head, I draw my final breath and now...
Acid eating away my nerves, blackening them like ash. Death upon my face, as humanity takes it's place. Chaotic words screaming through my bones.
,, It should be set up so that you have two verses before every hook. Make sure you start on a double verse and end on a double chorus, and you have a chorus between each verse.
 Write how you would love to want it back. It could also be about feelings - are you feeling lonely, sad, misunderstood, happy, etc? Show your emotions in the poem and use words that reflect this.
