 You can buy this at your local hardware store. An orb lighting fixture is usually used outside your house or garden, but in this tutorial, the orb will be used as the interior base for your pendant lamp.


If you have trouble locating an orb lighting fixture, using a paper lantern will work in a pinch.
The garden orb lighting fixture is your best choice due to its durability; it can withstand the heat generated by the pendant lamp.





;
, Set aside.
,,


Insert the loop end of the wire into the holes you just made.






Join the three wires together with a twistie or plastic tie, or bind them together using a pair of pliers.
,, Face the cupcake liner outward, pressing the glued base to the orb. Repeat with more liners in a neat row.
 Allow to dry completely.
 (See the image for guidance.)


Glue the liner flowers to the center of the cupcake liners you have already adhered to the surface of the orb.
 Now you can either rest or hang the pendant lamp in an appropriate place. Stand back and admire your work of art!


Call an electrician for hanging installation; this will allow you to hang the lamp on your ceiling.






You can use colored bulbs if you prefer for a more artistic look.
