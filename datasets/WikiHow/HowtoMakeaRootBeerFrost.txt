 A plastic cup, a metal jug, etc., will work.;
, Freezers and their temperatures vary, so keep checking to know how long it takes for your freezer.
 Break up the root beer ice using a butter knife or similar item. Breaking up the ice is mandatory, as it prepares the drink for the blender, creating smaller pieces. This is why you don't want to leave the root beer in the freezer too long - it'll be extremely hard to break into pieces.
 This is another reason why you don't want to leave the root beer in the freezer too long - ice that is too hard and large can harm your blender.
 If it's not frosty enough (namely, if it doesn't have enough ice), blend some extra ice in. Don't add too much ice though, as its wateriness will lessen the strength of the root beer taste.
 If wished, add optional toppings. Serve and enjoy.
