 Then keep a record of the progress for your own sanity. Take pictures, and check off the stages of the remodel as they are completed. This way you will have an idea of how long the renovations will take and if things are not going as discussed, you can question it. Seeing a light at the end of the tunnel makes it easier to endure a kitchen renovation. Plus you will have a cool record of the transition from old to new.;
, Portion them specifically for your family size so there is no wastage. Have your fridge brought to your new kitchen location or somewhere near by so you are not maneuvering through the danger zone at meal times.
 If possible, choose a location with a sink. Whether you decide on your basement or a utility room, ask your contractor to leave you a couple of old cabinets to store a few necessary items and set up a working counter top. A microwave, toaster, coffee maker, and a few other small appliances should suffice while your regular kitchen is out of commission.
 There will be times when you don't want to deal with your limited kitchen. Make a list also of inexpensive restaurants in the area so that you don't go bust eating out. Surviving kitchen remodeling means a lot of advance preparation.
 Contact a friend or family member for the use of their kitchen. Tell them you will bring the ingredients and feed them a meal if they let you use the kitchen and utensils. You could even prepare more freezer items if you are running out. Just make sure to clean up and wash everything you used when you are done.
 This may be a calming room in your home, a friend or family member's home, a park, or a local coffee shop.
 When you feel like you are going to get frustrated, think about how great it will be when your kitchen is complete.
