 This detailing draws the eyes upward, making your bust look bigger and downplaying the weight of your bottom half.
 While you may not have to worry about the lack of support, these tops only end up emphasizing your bottom half, making it look even fuller than it actually is.
 These stripes make your chest look fuller, balancing out your hips and legs.
 These deep necklines give you the illusion of cleavage, making your small bust look fuller and drawing the attention away from your hips.
 Black has a slimming effect. When combined with the boy short design, it can help mask the thickness of your upper leg. Avoid boy shorts in brighter colors, however, since the extra material may actually make your hips look larger if worn in an eye-catching color. Also avoid skirted bottoms.
 Bottoms that show more of your leg actually help lengthen it, and this lengthening effect often makes a thicker leg look thinner.
 The extra fabric gives the upper portion of your body a longer, stronger appearance. This extra length makes your bottom half less noticeable.
