, Put the almonds into a medium-sized mixing bowl, then drizzle the olive oil on top. Toss and stir the almonds until they are evenly coated with oil., If you want something sweeter, add 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar. If you are a strict vegan, or don't have any powdered sugar at home, you can use a vegan sugar substitute—just make sure that it is powdered. The fine texture of powdered sugar (and other sweeteners) allows it to dissolve better.If you can't find any powdered sugar at all, you can try using plain sugar instead.
 Keep stirring with a rubber spatula until the almonds are evenly coated., Make sure that the almonds are in a single layer. If they are clumped or piled together, they may stick or not cook evenly., Also, make sure that you spread the almonds back out to a single, even layer., If you have any leftovers, put them into an airtight container, and store them in a cool, dry place.
