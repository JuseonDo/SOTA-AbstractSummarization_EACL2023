, Some printers have latches; some open on a hinge; and others might require a screwdriver.



Find and lift out the all-in-one toner cartridge if your laser printer is newer and relatively inexpensive.
Take out the imaging drum. It is usually a bright green or blue color. Grab each side of the drum; do not touch the surface of the drum. Carefully lift out the imaging drum and place it in an area with no light.



Toner cloth is specially designed to attract and catch toner particles that other cloths would leave behind.
Rest the cartridge on another toner cloth.



Suck out any spilled toner you see in the interior.
Move the vacuum nozzle around slowly, lingering for at least 3 seconds for each crevice.



Scrub the corners gently to loosen any built-up toner.
Vacuum out the debris the paintbrush loosens.



Dip a cotton swab into rubbing alcohol.
Find the exposed fine wires inside the printer. They are usually near the paper rollers. Their purpose is to attract toner by transferring a static charge to the paper.
Rub the swab across the wires, twisting the swab when one side becomes soiled.

Pour rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab and scrub the roller in a circular motion to remove toner that has gathered.
