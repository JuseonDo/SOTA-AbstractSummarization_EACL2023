 This means, at least for kids old enough to understand, to use the restroom, have a drink of water, and if appropriate, to eat a meal before entering the sanctuary, or not to chew gum during the service. Hungry or thirsty kids may have a hard time enduring the hour or longer service, and going to the bathroom can be a disruption for several people as you make your way between the pews or seats and down the aisles.;
, For most church-goers, the service is a solemn event, and unwanted noise or movements can distract.
 If it is cold outdoors, wear a jacket that can be removed before you are seated so you are not hot and sweaty while you listen to the liturgy or message. For hot weather, especially with no air conditioning, avoid wearing formal attire like a suit jacket and tie unless it is required by your religious faith or beliefs.
 Sitting toward the back or at least near an aisle will decrease the distraction for others if behavior does become a problem.
 If a you are interested in the events going on, you will be less noises.
 Don't tug at persons sitting near you, or bother their belongings if they are within reach.
 You may need to bring a pen or pencil, as well, if there are none available. Never draw or write in the church's publications if they are found in the seats.
 Sing with the adults, if it is appropriate, but don't sing in too loud of voice if you are not familiar with the song, or you simply cannot carry a tune.
 Some churches have children's classes or groups to keep the kids busy while adults worship.
