, Use a sharp knife to cut the "X" shape into the chestnuts. This will make them boil more easily. Boiling chestnuts won't make them quite as tasty or aromatic, but it's a great way to quickly soften them.
, Wait at least 2-3 minutes until the chestnuts are cool enough for you to handle them.
, Enjoy these chestnuts plain or with 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and one tablespoon of melted butter.
