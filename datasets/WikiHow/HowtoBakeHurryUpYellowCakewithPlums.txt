If you want only part of the cake with nuts, don't add the nuts in until specified in Step 4.
 You'll need enough to cover the bottom of the cake pan with; if you're using small plums that might mean around 40 plums.


In the pictures greengage plums were used, but you can use any type so long as they're ripe.



If you decided to only use walnuts in half the cake, add the nuts to the batter after pouring half of it into the pan.
 The cake should be a light golden shade when done.
 Both cocoa butter and lemon icing are tasty options; the cake pictured here is iced with lemon icing.


Store any leftovers in the fridge; with icing this cake keeps good for several days.
