, Most dive courses provide most of the basic equipment but require you to own your own mask, snorkel, *Swim Fins, boots, gloves, and hood. You will also need to purchase your course materials (usually a book and video) and your first dive log book. (The course materials and log book together will usually cost under $35.)

, Most facilities that offer SCUBA courses are also dive shops. Be sure to save your receipts when purchasing your equipment, since many facilities will give you a discount on either the course or on future equipment rentals and air refilling services if you bought your equipment at their shop. The basic personal equipment needed for the course can cost anywhere from $200 to $500, or even more if you buy the fanciest gear.
 The cost of the course varies from region to region, and may even vary greatly within one area. For example, in Massachusetts you can pay anywhere from $125 to $500 for a PADI open water diving course.
 Some courses may do all of the water sessions in open water.
 Keep this card safe, since most dive shops will ask to see your certification card before refilling your air tanks or allowing you to rent equipment.
