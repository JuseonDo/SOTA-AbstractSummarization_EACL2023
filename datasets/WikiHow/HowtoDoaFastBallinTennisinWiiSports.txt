 If you want to practice, play against some computer opponents. You can't use Training mode to practice.;
, You can only perform a fast strike while you are serving.
 Don't hit it the first time, since you'll just be testing the timing.
 The ball will hang in one spot for a moment. Let the ball fall back into your hand. This will let you get a feel for the timing.
 Flick your Wii remote when the ball is hanging at the top of the toss. If you time it right, the ball should catch fire and shoot off very fast.


The speed that you flick your wrist doesn't matter, you just need to flick it exactly when the ball is at its highest point.
 Getting a consistent fast serve will take practice. You'll need to know the timing by heart if you want to be able to pull off these shots regularly., Once you've mastered the power serve, don't use it every time. Your opponent will expect it and will soon eb able to counter it easily. Instead, sprinkle power serves in every few serves to keep your opponents on their toes.
