 Suggested colors are blonde, white, or an unusual pastel color (pink, green, blue).
 Keep in mind that your border and fill dyes made need to be applied to wet or damp hair. (See specific dyes/dye boxes for instruction.)

, Make sure to coat the celery end evenly.


Avoid too much dye as you do not want it to drip on your hair right as you go to press it to your head.
 You can space them however you like but remember to not have each spot facing the same way.


It looks more realistic when the ‘C’ spots that the celery creates face different ways as they would on a real leopard.
 Simply wipe away any extra border dye.
 Stamp or paint in the center of the spot until it is completely filled.
 See dye box for any specific post-dyeing instructions.
