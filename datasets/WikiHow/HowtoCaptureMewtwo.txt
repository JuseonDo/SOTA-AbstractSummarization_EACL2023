 Or where you can find him. Search on the Internet, depending on your game, and get answers. Once you find his location, depending on the game you have (different Pokémon games have different locations for Mewtwo), you may proceed to the next step.;
,,,,, Also be sure to paralyze him or put him to sleep.
 If he uses Recover to bring his health back up, keep attacking. Remember to use potions on your Pokémon to heal them!


If you ran out of Pokéballs, hit the power button and then hit it again. Start over and catch him again. That is why it is important to save the game. That way, if you're in trouble, you can start over.
