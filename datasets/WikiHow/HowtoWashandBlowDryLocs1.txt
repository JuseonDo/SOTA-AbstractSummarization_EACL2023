 Long rinses ensure that locs are completely penetrated to allow a full cleansing. Warm water opens the hair cuticle to allow shampoo to penetrate deeply.
 Squeeze shampoo into locs a few times to clean inside the loc as well. Avoid shampooing more than a few times because it can lead to over dryness., Product build-up can occur if shampoo and other products are not completely removed from locs., Use 100% all natural oils that are not cold pressed.,, Cold water closes the hair cuticle to retain moisture.
