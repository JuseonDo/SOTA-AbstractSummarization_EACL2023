 You can keep it on your computer, in a spiral notebook, in a binder, or in a journal. Many people use binders because of the ability to shuffle pages around and create sections.;
, What do you believe in? Who are your patron gods/goddesses, if any? Do you follow the Wiccan Rede or the Threefold Law? Do you believe in spell casting, or only in ritualistic worship? These questions and more can help you get a better sense of your beliefs and put them on paper. (you do not have to do this if you don't want to.)

, Date all your entries for future reference.
 You can look back on these later and see how you are progressing, or what you may be able to do differently.
 As long as it inspires you, or honors the God/Goddess, it is fair game.
 At least the basics such as the moon phases and their meanings, basic color charts.
 It makes finding the correct Ritual, Spell, charm, Etc. much faster and can help make the ritual, spell, charm, etc. run more smoothly.
