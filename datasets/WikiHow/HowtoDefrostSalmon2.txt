 You will need to allow 30 minutes of defrosting time for every 1 lb. (454 g) of fish before you plan to cook it.
 This will keep the raw fish from spreading bacteria.
 The fish should be able to be fully submerged when the bowl is filled with water.


You can also use the sink to thaw your fish; however, it should be dedicated to keeping the fish during defrosting to avoid contamination.

If you are thawing salmon that was frozen in a block of ice, run cold water over the fish until all the ice chunks are removed. Then cover the fish in plastic wrap, place it in a pan and leave it in the refrigerator for 6 to 12 hours.
