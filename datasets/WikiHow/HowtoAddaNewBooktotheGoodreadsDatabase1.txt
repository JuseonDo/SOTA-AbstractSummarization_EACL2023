 Goodreads is a popular social bookmarking tool used to share the books you're currently reading with friends.
 You can choose to search by name, author's name, ISBN (13 digit/generally starts with '978'), ISBN (10 digit-old style ISBN barcode number), as well as a slew of other items.
 Although most often this can be determined by comparing the title with titles by the same author already on the Goodreads site, since every book is different, there are exceptions.


Newspapers, magazines, and comics are not books. By definition, these are not books for Goodreads, and therefore MUST not be added to the database.
