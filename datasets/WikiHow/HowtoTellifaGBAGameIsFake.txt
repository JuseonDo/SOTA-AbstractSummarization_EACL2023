 Sometimes, the label will be a custom one different from the official one. There are many things that can be altered: the Nintendo loo, the ESRB rating icon, and the Game Boy Advance logo. Search the cartridge on Google Images and compare them.;
, Most GBA games are grey, excluding the label. Some games, like the Pokémon Games, will have a certain colour, whether it is solid orange (FireRed) or green (LeafGreen), or translucent ruby (Ruby), green (Emerald) and blue (Sapphire) colors.
 If there is a small number imprint on the label, it most likely is official. Almost all (if not all) legit games have this. If there isn't, it's a fake.
 There should be a certain copyright text there. If there isn't, it's a fake.
 Mainly check the label, for such errors as Licensed or on the back Nintendo.
 Generally, these fakes won't save properly, and come up with a message when you start it. Pokémon fakes are generally always gonna do this.
 A good example is Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3. Which on the fake says 'Licensed By', but the regular cartridge just has "Nintendo" on it.
, If your game does has a battery inside, it's a fake.
