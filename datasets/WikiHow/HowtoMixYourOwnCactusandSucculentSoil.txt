  A good soil mixture includes components of sand, grit and a composting element.


The sand component should be horticulture grade quality. Asking your local nursery for horticulture sand will get you what you need.
The grit component can be a multitude of materials. Most popular grit components are pumice, lava fines and perlite.
The compost component can be something similar to the normal potting soil you might buy in a nursery.  Try to find a compost component low on sphagnum peat moss as it can attract unwanted pests for you succulents and cacti.;
,  This will keep your garden or workshop area a little cleaner.
 It's important to mix the components as best as possible to ensure your plant will be happy once planted.
  The soil will keep longer if it isn't bleached out by direct sunlight.
