 The size and shape will determine the shape of your magnets. Glass pieces with 1 textured side and 1 smooth side are available at craft stores or online.;
, Size them up on your computer so that they are small enough to fit on your magnet shape. Print them out on your computer or order them in the correct size from a photo shop.
 Look for magnet sheets with an adhesive side. If you cannot find this, then you can also buy individual button magnets.

If you chose a magnet sheet with adhesive on 1 side, cut out the correct size according to your glass shape. Remove the tape from the adhesive side and carefully place it on the back of your photograph. Press on it firmly.
If you chose a button magnet, then apply a dot of superglue onto the back of your photograph. Place it on the center, or place 2 dots, if it is a large photograph. Press button magnets onto the points of glue. Remove excess with a toothpick. Allow it to dry.
