 Cut into strips approximately 3/4 inch x 3/4 inch (2cm x 2cm).
 Crack the eggs into a bowl and add the milk. Whisk together.
 Pour the breadcrumbs into another bowl.
 Coat thoroughly.
 Coat thoroughly.
 At this stage, it may need another dip in the egg and more breadcrumbs added––judge this as you make it.
 Repeat for all of the sticks cut.
 When the oil is hot, fry 2 to 3 sticks at a time. (Don't overcrowd it, to avoid over-frying). Fry until the sticks turn golden, about a minute each side.
 Place on kitchen paper towel to drain some of the grease off.
 Use a dipping sauce such as sweet chili, pizza or tomato-based sauces.
