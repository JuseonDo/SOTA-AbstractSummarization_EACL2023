@article
 Scan the website, find out about the people the put on the show, and watch as many seasons of it as possible.;
, Be creative! When asked with three things you'd take on the island with you, don't say, "food, water, and shelter". Stand out!

, Don't be shy about yourself. So to speak, be yourself, but an extreme version. Watch other survivor audition videos to get ideas. The video must be under three minutes or CBS will not even consider it!

, Show yourself off and let them understand who you are! They already know how much you want to be on the show.
 The only thing left to do is wait.
