@summary
about a week or so before the dance/prom, text your crush to create a good, friendly conversation.

@summary
after a few moments of exchanging texts, ask him/her to go to the dance with you at an appropriate time in the conversation while it's still good.
@article
 It's best if you get his/her number beforehand while you two have a friendship so that you won't have to scramble to find his/her number! However, make sure you didn't just get your crush's number from a friend, or else he/she might get upset or scared and it'll be awkward.;
, Simply text, "Hey, I was thinking it might be fun to go to the dance. Want to?"


If your crush agrees, you're ready to go shopping.
If your crush declines, do not freak out. It might be that your crush just isn't ready to start a relationship with you, or he/she thinks of you as a friend. Still keep maintaining that relationship with your crush and treat him/her nicely. It still has its chances of blossoming into a romantic bond! Keep in mind that if you take this calmly, your crush might change his/her mind.
