,, Don't flip your phone around, up in the air or back and forth in your hands like you're in a circus. You can't appear mature when you look like an idiot.
 After you click the little green button to answer say "Hello" as if you mean it, but not in a hurried sort of way.
 That way you seem careless about the entire thing. That's discourteous, arrogant, and disrespectful.
 You could start with the standard hello. Not "hey", "talk to me" or a "you've got Phil," that's just obnoxious.
 When you start off you should not have the slightest hint of a chuckle in your voice, as if you've just gotten done listening to a really clever joke. Again, you will be obnoxious.
 Don't shout. Keep your voice low - high voices or hellos that vary in pitches are also obnoxious.
, If you wouldn't do it in front of him/her, don't do it.
