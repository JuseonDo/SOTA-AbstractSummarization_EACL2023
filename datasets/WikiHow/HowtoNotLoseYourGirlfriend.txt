 Right, then she should be your number one life priority: you should care for her as you care for yourself. If your girlfriend is indeed Ms. Right, she'll do the same for you.;
, Do all that you ever can to never lie to your girl, and if you do, own up to it immediately. If you truly love someone, you cannot hide a lie; you will feel terribly guilty, and when (not if) she finds out, everything you have ever told her is called into question---even "I love you."

, You have to respect her thoughts, always listen to what she says. Listen to her, girls don't like it when guys don't listen.
, In real relationships saying sorry is the first step of many. It will not solve the problem alone-you need to talk to solve it, but it will help open the doors of communication.
 She should respect you and understand your emotions and not act irrational.
 Women love to feel special.
 some girls get jealous others might assume that you are cheating.
 Right. But never do whatever you like or whenever you like and forget the fact that your relationship also needs time.
 The lack of time you spend together just makes her feel like if you don´t even care anymore. After all if you don't show to her that her opinion is important to you, that she is important and you're willing to spend time with her no matter what, how do you expect her to fill loved and respected? And if you haven´t had time or opportunity to be together, tell her how special she is to you, how much you miss her, and try to make plans even though there is still one week missing. That will only show her how much you want to be with her. On the other hand, if she tries to make plans and you can´t, make sure that she understands why you can´t and realize that even if she wants it or not she will be sad, she misses you, so why not let her know that you feel the same and that you love her?
