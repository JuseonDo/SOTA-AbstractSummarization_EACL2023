 If your broadband connection is linked up to your landline phone, check if the phone is properly connected and working.;
, The dial tone should be normal, and without white noise.
 If there’s no dial tone or there’s noise on the line, there may be a problem with the phone wires, which then affects your broadband connection. Report this.
