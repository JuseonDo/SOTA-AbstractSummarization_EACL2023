 Once you have at least 41 mining, a rune pickaxe should always be used (if you are a member and have 61 mining, a dragon pickaxe should be used if you can afford it).
 The population of the world you are in will depend on it - worlds with higher populations will have ores that respawn quicker.


If you are under level 20, use tin or copper. If you are level 20 or higher, use iron ore. If you are a member, use granite ore at level 80+.
, You can also trade it to a nearby "ore runner," making it a win-win process.
, Wield a dragon pickaxe (or rune if you can't afford the dragon).;
, Without these things, your player will begin to die.
 This will increase your chance of scoring 5 kg of granite.
