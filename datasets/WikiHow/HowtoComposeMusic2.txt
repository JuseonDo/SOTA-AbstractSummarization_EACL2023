 Songs have a definite structure to them. You want to get to the foundation as soon as you can, to create a strong base for your piece.
, Note: just lay down a basic beat to act as a template. Once you go to the other sections you can return to change things up a little based on the progressive sound of the song. Quite often I find I have a vision of what I'm trying to write and it will morph into something new. You have to be able to make adjustments along the way.
 Start with a basic chord progression then build and change it from there. For example a chord progression may use I, III, and V (ex C, E, G) and fall into a: I, III, pattern for example (where I is the root of the chord and III and V are the next two higher notes in the chord).
, You may have lyrics, then tailor a song to match them, or do the lyrics after the rhythm. The thing to keep in mind to to ensure you tell a good story. Don't be afraid to change lyrics or the music to achieve the best mutual fit.
 Let the lyrics help guide you if you have lyrics.
 Choose the mood or style of the song. You'll know you're there when you can't get the phrase (known as a "lick) out of your head! Quite often a 2-8 word phrase will do it (i.e. "shoulder lean", "love shack, baby love shack", etc).
,, Would you listen to it on the radio or change the station? Let others listen to it and make suggestions.
 But remember that too many adjustments may make your song sound or "taste" terrible, so don't over correct.
