Pile up your diced onions in a mound on the board. Pin the tip of your knife to the cutting board with your free hand and rock the knife up and down through the mound. (If you ever used, or saw your teacher use, one of those big paper cutters in school, you'll have an idea of the cutting motion.) Re-pile the onion pieces as needed.
