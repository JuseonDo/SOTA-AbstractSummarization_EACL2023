 You can either have the store fill the balloon, or you can buy a helium tank and fill it yourself, if the store sells them. Refer to the video on how to fill the balloon properly.;
, Keep in mind that you don't know who will receive it or if anyone will receive it at all.
 If you want it to be less susceptible to weather, put the note in the sealable plastic bag, seal it, and hole punch the bag.
 Make sure it is tied tightly. The longer it stays attached to the balloon, the farther it will travel.
 The windier it is, the farther it will travel.
