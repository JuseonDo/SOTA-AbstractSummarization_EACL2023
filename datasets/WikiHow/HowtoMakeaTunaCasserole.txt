, Once the water is boiling, this should take around 10 minutes, give or take. Test the pasta continuously -- you'll know when it's ready by the tenderness and taste. Drain and pour into a casserole dish.
 Stir well, thoroughly coating the pasta.
 Combine until evenly spread throughout the pasta. If you went with more pasta, you may want to add more tuna and cheese.
 This gives it a crunchy, delicious texture on top of the casserole.
 Check periodically, especially if your oven bakes unevenly. Allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving.
 Keep room for seconds!
