 If you don't like vanilla ice cream, you can use chocolate instead. This will create the base for your milkshake.;
, You can use any type of milk: non-fat, 2%, or whole milk. If you'd like a thinner milkshake, you can use up to ½ cup (120 milliliters) of milk.
 Try to use the smooth, creamy kind and not the chunky kind. It will be easier to blend and give you a smoother milkshake in the end.
 There should be no streaks or swirls of unmixed ingredients. If the blender isn't blending smoothly enough, pause it, and use a rubber spatula to push any unmixed milkshake down the sides.
 If you'd like, you can garnish it with a generous swirl of whipped cream and drizzle some chocolate or caramel sauce on top.
