 Tell them it is a spa party.;
, Try small, elegant things, like brownies or dumplings in porcelain plates.
, Pretty clothing should be protected with a larger shirt.
 These can be purchased in sets at any store. Examples include cucumber, avocado, green tea, and exfoliator. Each girl should pick one pack and open it.
 Imagine how nice this feels! Old dirty skin is being shed! Remember this as you scrub.
, Wipe up the bathroom counter with a paper towel once everyone is done.
 You can do each others hair in funky styles. Have a variety of rubber bands and hair clips present along with small, disposable hair combs.
 Technically, there should be about twenty different nail polishes. Varieties should include metallic (gleaming), non-metallic (dull) and glittering nail polish. Have cool colors, including sea foam green, red, blue, orange, pink, white, purple, rose, turquoise, violet-red, etc. Imagine how nice a sparkling, rich orange would look! You can buy small tubes of these polishes cheaply at any small store. Make sure you have plenty of cotton balls and nail polish remover.
 Take turns with the polishes. Start out by applying either a dull or gleaming layer of polish. You can plan out by having different colors for each nail. Make sure to include different shades of each color.
 Whether in the same color or in white, glitter adds it all! If you want to, then trim your nails, although long nails look good with polish.
 Take turns using the stickers, just stick them onto your nails and apply a clear coat of polish to fasten it on.
 Good ideas include pizza, pasta, chicken fingers, macaroni with cheese, etc.
 You can all take turns applying tattoos to each other. If you want to, try on make-up for pictures, but remember to wash it off before sleeping to stop pimples.
