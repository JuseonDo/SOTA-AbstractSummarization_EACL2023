 Make sure you pack the essentials such as your clothes, purse, money, and cards.;
,,, Make sure to purchase cleaning supplies. You probably also want to buy some furniture, towels, bed sheets and comforters, kitchen essentials, toiletries including shampoo, conditioner, body wash, razors, toothpaste, toothbrush, and toilet paper.
, Chances are you might want to vacuum the place and scrub down the kitchen and bathrooms.
 Personalize the place with your own touches but remember to agree with your roommate before purchasing anything!

, Contact the electric, gas, water, garbage, Internet, phone, cable companies you will be using.
 Don't go full on grocery shopping, you are probably dead tired and you probably don't want to carry bags back to your apartment. Just grab some stuff for breakfast and some drinks!
