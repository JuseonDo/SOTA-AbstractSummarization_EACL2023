You will want to use 2-inch (5.1 cm) stones for herb pots and larger stones for garden-planted herbs.
 Allow them to dry completely.
 Practice using them to stamp the name of your herbs on a sheet of paper. You may need to experiment with how far apart you want the letters to be.
 Allow each stone to dry for an hour before placing it nearby your plant in a garden or pot.
