 Stall Slaking is more annoying than Scarf Slaking so it will have more effecting moves.
 Leftovers regain your HP after every single turn.
 Impish ups Defense but lowers Special Attack. Slaking is more of a Defensive/Attacker Pok√©mon, so Impish would be more beneficial.

Amnesia - Good Special Defense boost just in case.
Protect - To see what the opponent will do and let the Toxic continue.
Giga Impact - Attacking coverage.
