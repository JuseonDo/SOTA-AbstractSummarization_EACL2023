, Dampen it well but do not leave it dripping.
 Don't add too much, just a dab.
 Rub it back and forth over the area affected by the rust.


You can also try scraping off the rust using a soft toothbrush, a long fingernail or a toothpick.
 Then rinse off with warm water soaked into a sponge (wring it before use).
 Rub it with paper towel or a clean cloth to remove any water, then allow it to air dry before using again.
 You are done with cleaning the rust.
