 Leave tabs on each of the sides.


It will look like this:





;
,,  Make the holes be about 1 inch (2.5cm) apart in the center of the tab in this manner:

, Each milk jug hot cap will have 4 loop stakes, one for each tab. You can buy several packages of loop stakes at a hardware store like Lowe's or a garden store for a package of 10. You can also make your own loop stakes from used hanger wire. You will need a lot of hangers; ask your local charity store or dry cleaner for spares.
 Put a little dirt over each tab to help hold them in place. Save the lids to the milk jugs and put them on the "hot caps" at night if it is going to be especially cold, but always take them off in the day so that air movement will help prevent sunburn as well as mold growth.
 You can clean them and store them away for next year or make new ones as needed.
