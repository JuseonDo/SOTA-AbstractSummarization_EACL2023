 You can soak it in water and mild soap and then let it air dry.
 You may have to place some objects under the radiator to line it up with the fan.
, You may have to try a couple of sizes to find the right size of tubing that will fit over the copper tubing from your radiator. The tube length should be long enough to connect with the garden hose outside.
 You may need to cut a small hole in your window screen to make this work.
 Wrap pipe insulation around the exposed end to keep the water cold.



Thread the tubing upward through your window so that the water is expelled onto your roof or into your gutters.






If you expel water onto your roof, then you'll need to make sure that the overflow hitting the ground doesn't flood your basement. Try placing a large plastic garbage can beneath the stream to catch the water, and recycle the water in your garden.



Cut the plastic inlet tubing to leave a 6" (15 cm) stub attached to the copper inlet tube of the radiator.






Attach the end that releases water to the stub of inlet tube.






Connect the side that pulls in water to the tube that's connected to your garden hose.
 On the outside of your house, open the garden hose spigot to find the right water flow volume.
 When you're ready to switch off your homemade air conditioner, close the hand valve and unplug your fan.
