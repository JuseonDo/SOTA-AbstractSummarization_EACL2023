@summary
plan how wide you want your ring to be, and mark it with a sharpie or other marker.

@summary
place pipe segment on table or another edge, and using a hacksaw, cut vertically down your mark.

@summary
take a sheet of #150 grit sandpaper and place on a table or other flat surface, rough side up.

@summary
sand until desired thickness.

@summary
once the side is smoothed, hold the #150 grit sandpaper and ring in your hands.

@summary
once you have the ring in the desired size and shape, take the #220 or finer sandpaper and gently sand the entire ring, so it is very smooth.

, You may need assistance holding the rest of the pipe from moving around while cutting. You should end up with the piece that you will sand down to your final product.
 Place the side you just cut from the pipe on the sandpaper and rub in a back and forth motion, applying slight pressure. If the pipe was too tight on your finger, sand out the inside of the ring until it fits properly.
 Remember, the sandpaper is rough, and PVC is not, so it does not take much time to sand it down too far and mess up. Make sure the ring is as vertical from the surface as you can get it to ensure there are no high or low spots on the ring.
 Sand down the edges, so they are gently curved and look like a real rings' edges.
 It will not be glossy like PVC pipe unless you polish it, so don't worry if it looks dull.
