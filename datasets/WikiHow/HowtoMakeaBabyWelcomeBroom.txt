 Read that section first to understand the rest of this article.;
,, Cut at the correct length, leaving a little extra space. Cut a few longer pieces for streamers. If you would like to write something on one of the streamers (the baby's name, etc.), do so now. You can make a bow, or cut several pieces at a time to build a bow, by looping and gluing one piece at a time.
 Apply hot glue sparingly, beginning in the top center to the back of the handle of the broom. Place one of the cut ends of the ribbon on the first glue dot and press, allow to dry. Then slowly wrap the handle, leaving small gaps, so that the broom can be seen; once to the end, apply a dab of glue, press and hold. Snip any excess ribbon off.
 The goal is to place the ribbon on the broom section; thus you need to decide how you want the broom to be hung up, for that will make a big difference in what direction to place the ribbon. Before adding the streamers be sure the word (Welcome or baby's name) has been already applied; then carefully glue pieces up under the bow, by simply lifting the edges of the bow and applying dabs of glue...then follow suit...same as above. See tip below for streamers.
 These items can be glued on, or tied on by using thin ribbon. If using glue just follow the same step as for ribbon. See suggestion under Tips.
