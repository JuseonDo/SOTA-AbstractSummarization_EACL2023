 You have another option “system image”, by creating system image you can create backup of system settings, data, programs which are required to run your computer properly.

 Use a good antivirus program and update it regularly with latest virus definition. In my opinion you must use paid version as the free version antivirus has limited capability so it cannot provide full protection. The paid version offers maximum security and protects your computer from all harmful threats like virus, malware etc.
 Before installing any software or updating any existing software it is always advised to check its compatibility with your computer.
