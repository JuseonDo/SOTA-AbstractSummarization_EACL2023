 You can delete Instagram from the "Help Center" option in your Settings menu.;
, You can do this by tapping the person-shaped icon in the bottom right corner of your screen.
 This is in the top right corner of your screen.
 This is in the "Support" group of settings options toward the bottom of the Settings menu., This is near the top of your phone's screen.
 This will redirect you to a help page with information about deleting your account.
 You don't need to read the contents of this page, since Instagram provides a link to the actual "delete account" function in the first numerical step here.
 This should be under the "To permanently delete your account:" heading, next to step one.


You can also tap the "Temporarily disable your account" link here for a less permanent solution. Disabling your account will remove it from search results, but you'll be able to re-enable it at any time.
 This is to verify the account you wish to delete.


Tap "Login" to proceed to the "Delete Your Account" page.
 This is below the "Why are you deleting your account?" text; tapping it will prompt you to choose a reason you're deleting your account.
 This will unlock the rest of the account deletion option.
 This should be further down the page, beneath the "To continue...enter your password" text.
 This will erase your Instagram account and all content associated with it!

, This will exit your Instagram app.
 Depending on how many apps you have, this may be several swipes to the right of your Home screen.
 This will prepare the app for deletion; it should begin shaking, and an "X" should appear in the top left corner of the icon.
 This will indicate that you wish to delete the Instagram app from your iPhone.
 This will delete your Instagram app and all of its data!
