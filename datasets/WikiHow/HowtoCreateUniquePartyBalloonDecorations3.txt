 Look for a smaller arrangement that sits neatly in a basket or small box. You will be transforming the arrangement into a hot air balloon in a basket so you want the basket of flowers to be smaller than the balloon you use.
 You want balloons that are larger than your flower arrangement and can be blown up with helium. Both Mylar and latex balloons will work well. You will want to use one balloon per arrangement.
 You will need ribbon or string to create the hot air balloon effect, plus glue to hold it in place. Regular white glue should do the trick.
 Tie and knot the bottom or clamp in place.
 You will want ribbon to reach from one corner of the arrangement to the opposite corner and over the balloon. You will need approximately two pieces of string.
, You want the string/ribbon to end up making an “X” on top of the balloon.
