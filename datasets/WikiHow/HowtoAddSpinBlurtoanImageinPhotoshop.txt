 And an image.;
, Do this by pressing Ctrl+J in Windows or ⌘ Command+J in Mac.



The Spin Blur gallery will come up with a circle of blur already created in the middle of the image.



In this case, the desired position is Car's wheel.
 The mouse pointer will change into a four headed arrow when clicked.
 Do so by pressing Alt or ⌥ Option and clicking the middle point of the circle and dragging it.



10 to 27 degree is the most convenient.




Noise is given to add more realism to an image. Without noise an image can look totally fake(photoshop-ed).

Motion Effects can also be added. Although some motion effects are added by Photoshop by default.
 Don't click inside any already present circle of blur.



It may take time depending upon the processor and graphics card.
 If the blur is coming out of the wheel, you can add a layer mask.
