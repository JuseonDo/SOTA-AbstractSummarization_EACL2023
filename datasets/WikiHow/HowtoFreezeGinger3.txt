 Choose a reasonably large sized ginger to make it easy to form medallion shapes. Peel the ginger.
 Simply cut down along the line of the ginger to make "rounds" that look sort of like crooked medallions. Continue until all of the ginger piece or pieces are used up.
 Try to pack it as tightly as possible. Press down to expel the air out of the bag. Alternatively, arrange in layers inside a small freezer-proof container.
 This ginger will keep for up to three months.
