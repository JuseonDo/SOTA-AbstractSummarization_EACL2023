 Her head is roundish and her hair should be flipped and in a bob-like hairdo (as shown). Add an ear on the left side of her head. Don’t forget to draw vertical and horizontal lines. This will help you later when you need to draw her face.
 Start by giving her a short neck, a long skirt and circles for her gown’s puffy sleeves.


Before drawing details, draw first plain and bigger items such as Princess Daisy’s gown to help you in drawing.
 Give her a flower brooch, gloves, and put ruffles on her sleeves.
 Note: Do your best to make them flower-like.
, Make her eyes big and round. Her nose should be small and pointy.
 You can use a real flower for inspiration or simply copy the design of her brooch.
 You can use a pen or marker (or paint brush). Don't forget to erase your pencil marks. This will help your drawing look clean.


Use a fine pen-point when outlining her face. A thicker pen works best for the rest of the illustration.
 Use lots of yellow/orange and red/orange. You'll need green for her flower accessories and a hint of blue for her eyes.
 At the top, draw a circle. Add a trapezoid on the upper third of the line.;
,,, Draw four lines for arms and two ovals for eyes.
 Add a few ovals for the details in her dress.
, Erase any unnecessary guidelines.
