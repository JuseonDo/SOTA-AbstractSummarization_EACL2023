 Add the white glue to the bread crumbs, and mix with a fork until all the crumbs are moistened.
 This will vary depending on the dryness of your bread. The mix should be pliable and somewhat sticky. If it feels very wet, or too gummy to roll into a ball, tear up and mix in a little more bread.
 Knead it for a minute or two with his fingers or rolling it between his palms. Soon the dough will become elastic and satin like.


As your child models the dough, it may begin to dry out. If it does, he can dip his fingertips in water (have a small bowl at the worktable) and knead the dough until it becomes more pliable.
 Unlike many homemade doughs, this recipe has a fine, elastic texture that won't crack, even during intricate modeling projects like earrings, buttons, beads or tiny figurines. Bread dough also is a great medium for taking impressions: A small piece pressed against the outside of a favorite shell makes a beautiful pendant or faux fossil. To add a hard, semigloss finish, your child can mix equal parts water and white glue and brush on several coats.


Drying time: White bread dough air-dries in 1 to 3 days.
