,, If you do this first, then you can be sure to have all the data and forms you need at hand before you fill out the FAFSA itself. Be sure you include the code for each college you are interested in on the FAFSA.
 The Dept will process it and send a copy of the data to all the schools you listed. You will also receive a paper confirmation.
 The website www.fafsa.ed.gov lists the states and their deadlines. You apply to your state of residence, not the state where you will attend school. You should also access your state scholarship website for more information about the specific types of scholarships they offer. Google your state if you don't know the website.
 You should be sure to ask both the admissions and financial aid offices for information on these.
 You can also Google "college scholarships" or something similar to check out other opportunities. Stay away from any sites where you have to pay for their information.
