 Knowing how much you can afford to spend is definitely a must or you'll overspend.
 Knowing how much you can spend is good, but you should set up a certain amount that you want to try to spend. Then try to stay within the limits., Sometimes you already have more than enough to create to make a meal so consider checking and think about it first., Because doing so will help you save money on other things. There's no point in buying something that you will inevitably throw out.,, Such as:

Baked Potatoes with sour cream and milk/water
Eggs (Hard boiled or scrambled) with bread and water/milk/juice
Soups with chips and a side of fruit
Pasta with cheap vegetables and water
Chili with water and a side of fruit
Sandwich (cheese with chicken and tomatoes) and water or milk
Instant Noodles (without the flavor package, which contains mostly sodium) and add vegetables
Fried rice with vegetables and a cup of water
Salad with shredded cheese and juice or water
Fruits and crackers with a cup of milk
Garlic bread with tomato soup

, Generic doesn't necessarily mean the product's quality is bad. It just means the product isn't as popular as the brand name ones, thus it's cheaper to make the product., You can easily get a lot of extra food for free or at a cheap price. But be careful, they will most likely charge you the expensive one if both of the same products one weighed more than the other., Put them in a small container, just the amount you are able to eat without any bits or pieces left over. Doing so will help you make sure you don't waste anything nor overeat., Consider putting any food you haven't cooked yet in the freezer because you'll be able to use them later on instead of buying more., Or if it's clean but you feel unsafe, then consider boiling it or allowing it to go through a water filter first before consumption, or do both, to stop worrying.
