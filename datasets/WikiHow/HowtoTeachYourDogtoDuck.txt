 If you haven't already, target and clicker train your dog. The target can be a certain stick or your finger, palm or fist. Let the dog sniff at the target, and click when it does. Do this a few times to warm up.;
, Move the target down right under the dog's head. Click when the dog sniffs at the target. Repeat this step four times.
 Click when the dog lowers its head to sniff at the target. Repeat this step four times.
, Click when the dog moves its head down when the target is not there. Repeat this until the dog understands exactly how to do this.
 Only click when the dog lowers his or her head as fast as you want him or her to do. This can take time.
 The command can be "duck" or anything else you want to call it. When you see the dog is about to duck, say "duck" and click if the dog ducks. Repeat this many times.
 If it does, do not click. Just wait for a few seconds, then say "duck". If the dog ducks, click and reward. Test your dog by sometimes saying a random word, and sometimes saying the command. Only click when the dog ducks on command.
 The dog should be able to do the trick even when you are in different positions. Also sit down, then have your arms up in the air, etc.
