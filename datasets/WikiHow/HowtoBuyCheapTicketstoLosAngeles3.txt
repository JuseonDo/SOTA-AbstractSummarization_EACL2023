 In order to maximize occupancy, many airlines deliberately overbook flights or sell tickets at deeply discounted rates to ensure sales. Third parties get leftover tickets at huge discounts.
 This means that you show up for an overbooked flight and ask to get on the list of those who might take the next flight in exchange for a free ticket, which you could use to fly to Los Angeles.
 When an airline flies to a city like Los Angeles, it sometimes knows that it will have empty seating, so it offers those empty seats to a bucket shop at a deeply discounted rate.
