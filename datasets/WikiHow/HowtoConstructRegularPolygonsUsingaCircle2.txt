ℓ=2*r*sin(180/n)
180/n is in degrees, so make sure your calculator is set for degrees, not radians.
 Be ultra-accurate and triple check the measurement to ensure that it is as accurate as possible.
 Don't change the radius of your compass.
 Continue the process until the arc or line touches the first point.


Make sure your compass doesn't move!

Check to see that the sides are identical in length.
If they are, then you're finished. Rub out the construction guide lines.
