 First of all, you need a toothbrush. One for a toddler is the best.;
, Not only do ferrets love the flavor of this toothpaste, but it also helps break down the plaque on their teeth. If you can't find ferret toothpaste at your pet store, it can be ordered from online pet stores or amazon. If you cannot find ferret toothpaste at your pet store , or are to busy to go to the hassle of ordering online , then cat or kitten toothpaste Is a somewhat, albeit not completely safe, alternative to special ferret toothpastes (WARNING: all human toothpastes including toddler, are extremely toxic to ferrets as well as dog pastes.) The amount of toothpaste you should squeeze onto the brush should be about half the size of a green pea.

 If you brush too hard, their gums may bleed so be very careful!
