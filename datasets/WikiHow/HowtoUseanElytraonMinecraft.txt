, This will create a small contraption containingÂ a strange, sparkly block somewhere outside the main island.
 If the arrow does not trigger that, try throwing an ender pearl in the middle block (which is actually a block of End Portal material).


You will be teleported to a different type of End, consisting of many different-sized islands (don't fall off!) that have forests of purple plants called chorus plants.
 End cities are towers (not actually cities) that have a spiral staircase that leads up to a dock.
 Enter this ship.
 There will be a chest containing lots of iron and diamond.
 These are the elytra. Break the item frame. This will cause the elytra to drop, allowing you to get them.
, You'll need ladders or a bunch of blocks. (Ladders would be better, since you can climb down them.)

,, This will cause you to glide.
 Look up to temporarily rise, but doing so for too long will cause you to stall, which will make you fall faster. Look down to descend rapidly. Looking down long enough will raise your momentum to where you can look up suddenly and fly much higher.
