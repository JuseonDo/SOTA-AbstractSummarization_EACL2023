 When you're in the middle of nowhere, and have limited supplies of kindling, Doritos make great kindling. Cheetos, Fritos, and the others like that also burn well. The reason they burn is because it's basically pure hydrocarbons (which burn) soaked in fat (which burns). Maybe another life hack would be to stop eating them?

, This quick and easy method only requires one holder. The ones with foil on the edges work best, but any type will do.
 Tie them in a knot first, then plug in the ends. This should keep one end from pulling out.
 Use all the sunscreen, then clean out the bottle by rinsing it, putting it in the dishwasher, or soaking it to get rid of all the oils. Make sure to use an inconspicuous bottle so you don't attract attention.
 That way, the bee will not feel as threatened to sting. When being blown, bees will most likely think the wind is moving.
 Roll the foil into a line, then unravel the end, making it into a spoon shape.
 Unlock your smartphone's screen, or use a flashlight app if desired. Place the phone beneath the Gatorade bottle. Your surrounding environment should immediately become much brighter, thanks to the bottle's light-distributing qualities. The Gatorade bottle will send your phone's light beams out in a wider range, helping to illuminate a larger-than-expected sized area around itself. You can use a full bottle of Gatorade and create colored lights.
