Your rival (he or she) will give you an Absolite (the Mega Stone for Absol) and tell you to visit Professor Sycamore (he is found in Anistar City).;
,
You will find 'Medichamite', the Mega Stone for Medicham in front of the well, over the bridge in this city.
You will also find 'Gengarite', the Mega Stone for Gengar by talking to the girl with purple hair standing in front of the two blue houses. These houses are up the steps and left from where the well is.

Continue right until you have to go downwards to continue.
Here, continue downwards until you reach the water.
Follow the water, down the waterfall, get out of the water and then travel right to the 'Chamber of Emptiness'.
Within this small cave-like place you will find 'Banette', the Mega Stone for Banette.

Follow the path onwards and then into Reflection Cave.
Go forward.
Turn right.
Head downwards.
Take the second turn on the right, not the first as it is a dead end.
Follow this path and go down the steps.
Once downstairs go forward and then head downwards where the person is standing.
Turn right and follow the path as far as you can, in the wall's reflection you will see that there are small steps and you can go on them (downwards direction).
Get off the rock (to where the Karate Guy is running back and forth) and follow that path (right then upwards to where another guy is running in circles).
Turn left and go up three small steps so you're on higher ground.
Go downwards and then down the stairs.
Continue upwards and turn left. You will see a door in the cave wall's reflection. Enter it.
Head downwards, through another door and then simply follow the path.
At the end of the path you will find 'Alakazamite', the Mega Stone for Alakazam.

Travel downwards across the bridge then travel right, up the steep steps.

At the base of the middle waterfall you will find 'Gyaradosite', the Mega Stone for Gyarados.

Behind Abomasnow is 'Scizorite', the Mega Evolution stone for Scizor.

Up the steps after the first trainer in the gym, you will see two rock climbing walls beside each other, one left and one right.
Climb the wall on the right and you will find either 'Tyranitarite', the Mega Evolution stone for Tyranitar if you are playing Pokémon X or 'Aggrontite', the Mega Evolution stone for Aggron if you are playing Pokémon Y.

Travel downwards to where Strength is needed to push the boulder into the ground.
Turn left then follow the path downwards.
Rather than turning left and following the path further, continue downwards off the path and onto grass where two roller skaters are circling a huge rock, here at the bottom of the rock you will find 'Manectite', the Mega Stone for Manectric if you are playing Pokémon X, and 'Houndoomite', the Mega Stone for Houndoom if you are playing Pokémon Y.

Turn left and follow the corridor until you reach the stairs. Go up the stairs.
At the top of the stairs directly beside them you will see 'Mawilite', the Mega Evolution stone for Mawile.

Behind the sign as you first enter the forest there is long grass where wild Pokémon appear.
At the top left corner of the grass you will find 'Pinsirite' for Pincer if you are playing Pokémon X or Heracrossite for Heracross if you are playing Pokémon Y.

In Glittering Cave take the first right turn then travel to the very end of the path to where you will find 'Kangaskhanite', the Mega Stone for Kangaskhan.

Head to Lumiose City and go to the Stone Emporium on Vernal Avenue (take the taxi if you do not know the way).
