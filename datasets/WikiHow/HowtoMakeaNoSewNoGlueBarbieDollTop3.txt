, Ensure that the semi-circle is big enough to wrap around the doll's torso., The doll's arms should be just above the half circle. Take the two ends and from underneath the doll's arms, pull it over the doll's shoulders and to the doll's back., You could also use Velcro to fasten the ends to the doll's back.
