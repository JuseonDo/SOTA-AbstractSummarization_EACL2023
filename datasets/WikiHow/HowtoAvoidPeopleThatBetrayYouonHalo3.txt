 Try to stay calm whilst doing this as getting angry or giving them a reaction will only intensify their desire to annoy you.;
, Don't run or take extreme evasive action, but rather just slowly walk away. Giving them any attention will only bring more torment, probably in the form of tea-bagging or voice messages.
 Show no emotion and do not fight back (quite often they will boot you if you betray them back). These types of gamers are seeking attention and power and if you simply ignore them, they will go away.
 In Halo 3's multiplayer, team mates can, in most cases, only betray you once before the game gives you the option to boot them. If they kill you once then they will most likely not do it again in fear of getting booted. Only a determined trouble-starter will continue to betray you.
 If the person tries to betray you and there are enemies around, if he kills you it will almost certainly be attributed to the enemy and you will not receive a chance to boot the person betraying you.
 You can only boot someone in Custom Games or Forge sessions. If you are not party leader, ask someone who is to boot the player or ask to be made party leader so that you may then do it yourself.
 Again, they win if you give them a reaction. If you are no fun to betray, they will most likely move onto another member of your team which may not have a problem betraying them back and risk getting booted.
 This will lessen the chances of you meeting them ever again, but remember, it's not fool-proof.
