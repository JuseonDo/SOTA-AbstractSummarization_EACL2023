 Make a small amount of a 1 to 1 solution of the rubbing alcohol and distilled water. Note: be sure that the water is distilled, as tap or spring water can cause permanent damage to your CD.
 Alternatively, you can use a chamois.
 Gently wipe the CD, starting from the center hole and wiping straight out to the edge. This should be done all around the CD
