, Warm the pan over a high heat before adding 3 tablespoons of oil. Add 3 sticks of cinnamon, a sprinkling of cardamom pods, and a sprinkling of cloves. Cook for about a minute. The oil will help extract the flavour of the spices. Add the chopped onions and cook for a further 10 minutes until golden brown. Keep stirring occasionally.
, Stir in the ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chilli, coriander, and cumin powder. Turn the heat down a little and stir well because dry ingredients can easily stick to the bottom of the pan.
 Turn up to a high heat as there is now less risk of the ingredients sticking to the bottom and burning. Stir for a further 2-3 minutes.
 If the ingredients stick at all, add a little more water.
,, Stir until all the pieces are smothered with sauce. Turn the stove down to a low heat, add a little water, and stir. Cover and simmer for about 6-8 minutes.
