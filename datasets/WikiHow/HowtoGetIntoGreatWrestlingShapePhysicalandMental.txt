 Wake up in the morning before school/class/when everyone wakes up, and run a distance that makes you want to throw up. Do this at a fast pace. Do push-ups and sit-ups, as well as stretch, at both the halfway point and end point. Increase distance every couple of days.;
,, You can always do more, but make sure you sprint all the time.
 Do the basics over and over until you can't get them wrong. Say what you're doing as you do the technique.
 Rotate opponents after each period, after each match rotate out. Always feel free to do more according to your motivation and physical condition. Also try doing sit ups to get those "washboard abs".
