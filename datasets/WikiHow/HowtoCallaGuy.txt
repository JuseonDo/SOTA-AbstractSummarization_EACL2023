 Homework, you met him earlier, need to ask him something, etc... And find a good way to break the ice.;
, It's hard to talk and sound sweet while screaming into the phone because he can't hear you or your friends are talking too loud.
 Sometimes you can get scared and forget everything you meant to say.
 Avoid awkward silences by asking him a question when you feel like an awkward silence is going to happen. Don't ask a yes/ no question, like, do you like bowling. Ask him a question that needs a long answer, such as, what's your favorite part in -insert his favourite film- and why?If he is not a really shy person, then let him talk.
 Get him talking about this to loosen him up, and it's good to show that you're interested in him.
 Ask him about his interests. Ask him things like what his favourite football team is, or what kind of music he likes.
 Then use these similarities later on. If you want to ask him on a date and you know you both like horror films, ask him to the cinema to see the new scary film!!
