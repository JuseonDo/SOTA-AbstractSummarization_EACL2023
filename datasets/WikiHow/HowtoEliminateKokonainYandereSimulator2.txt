 This step is not required, but these are the recommended panties for this method., You must take five panty shots, use them to buy a clean uniform, and then modify it in the sewing room., You must take a picture of the kitten at the side of the school., Since Kokona is a social butterfly, she will happily pose for you., You can do this by clicking the 'Love' icon., Tell him to have slicked back hair, glasses, and piercings. These changes will not take effect until the next day., This raises your seduction level, thus making it easier to matchmake them., After some/all of this is done, you can go to her profile and see her interests by pressing R. Memorize what she likes and dislikes.

Watch Kokona cook in the cooking club after school.
Make Kokona follow you and walk past the kitten outside.
Listen to Kokona and Saki's conversation on the rooftop at lunchtime on Monday.
Write a note to Kokona to meet you on the rooftop to talk about domestic abuse, and then offer help when you see her (you do not have to do anything past that). You can write the note by going to her locker.
On Monday morning, go outside in front of the school and listen to Kokona's phone call.
Make Kokona follow you into the occult club and take her near the ritual knife.
Walk past her and the group of girls in the morning or during lunch while she is talking to them in a circle.
Make Kokona follow you and go near Pippy and/or Ryuto who are playing games in the computer lab.
Take a picture of another student, and then use the gossip option when talking to Kokona.
,,,, You have to tell Kokona first or else you can't tell Riku., If this goes successfully, the meter at the top will fill up. He can:

Comment negatively on something Kokona dislikes.
Comment positively on something she likes.
Compliment her.
Show off his wisdom.
Give her the rose from earlier.
, As she now has a boyfriend, she is no longer into Senpai, so you have successfully eliminated her.
