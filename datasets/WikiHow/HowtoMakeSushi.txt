, Then fill the rice pot with new water (how much water depends on the amount of rice of the cooker and the same goes for how long to cook it; the instructions are usually in the box).
 Repeat on the cucumber.
, If it's ready, take it out and put it in a dish.
 You can add more or less depends on your taste buds and how separated you want your grains or rice. It is better to put in less right now and add more later. Add in sugar and salt and stir until it dissolves (repeat until it tastes good).
 Add rice wine vinegar if needed to make the grains of rice separate easily.
 It should be spread out so there are no empty holes and it should fill the middle third. Dampen the end edge with rice vinegar so it sticks when you roll it. Place the strips of the veggies and the crab onto rice.
 It should look like a tube of some sort. Now remove the sushi roll from the bamboo and cut out as follows.
 Repeat by cutting both halves down the middle simultaneously, take those portions and repeat one last time. This cutting technique insures that the ingredients do not spill out of the roll.
