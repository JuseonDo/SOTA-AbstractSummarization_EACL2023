 A ten gallon tank is the norm for guppies. Anything less will likely not cycle and you will be stuck cleaning water every couple of days.;
, Ensure that the gravel is thoroughly rinsed prior to adding it to the tank. Gravel comes in a variety of colors, such as red, yellow, and green.
 Insert them and create a little hole (as if you were planting a real tree). Real plants are normally not much more expensive, give a better feel and fish generally don't eat them. Just be sure to check their living conditions before buying.
 Make sure the décor does not have any sharp or pointy objects on it. This could harm your fish by tearing their delicate fins. They can be quite fragile.



Note: Filters and heaters are nearly always necessary to keep water clean and tank heated to the correct temperature.
 Make sure that the water is about room temperature because it could kill the fish if it is way too cold or way too hot.
, If you just got back from the pet shop, allow the fish bag to float on top of the water for at least 10 to 30 minutes while slowly replacing the bag water with tank water. This will allow the fish to slowly adjust and adapt to the water temperature and pH of the tank.


Slowly release the fish into the tank.
