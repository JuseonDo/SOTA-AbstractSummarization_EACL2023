 The more mild your soap is, the less likely it is to have a harmful effect on your plants. Stay away from anti-bacterial, scented, and other specialized soaps.
 Combine the soap and water using your hands or a large spoon.
 You may not be able to fit all of the solution into a bottle, but you should use the largest bottle you can find to make use of as much of the solution as possible.
 Spray a small section of the infested plant with the solution and monitor it throughout the course of a day. If it does not wilt or change color, the solution is likely safe.
 Cover the top and undersides of leaves, focusing on the areas that seem the most overcome. This spray works by paralyzing insects, making them unable to eat.
 Since this pesticide is fairly diluted, continued application is the only way to ensure that the infestation ends.
