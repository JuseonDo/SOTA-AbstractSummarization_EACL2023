 This will be your base. If you can't find any oat or oatmeal flour, you can make your own by grinding up oatmeal to a fine powder in a blender or food processor. You can also try using another type of flour instead.
 Try to get beef gelatin powder, if you can. It is beneficial to a dog's joints.
 What dog doesn't like peanut butter? Just make sure that you get the smooth, unsalted kind. More importantly, make sure that it doesn't contain xylitol. Xylitol is a substitute sweetener commonly added to sugar-free products. It can be deadly to dogs., Coconut oil is great not just for you, but for your dog as well. It can help make your dog's coat glossy and smooth.
 You can use the store-bought kind, but make sure that it is low-sodium. If you have extra time, however, you could make your own at home. This way, you can ensure that it is as low in sodium as possible.
 Once the dry ingredients soak up all of the wet ones, switch to kneading the dough with your hands. Be careful not to over-work it, however, or the coconut oil will turn too soft.
 The balls need to be big enough to completely cover your dogs pills. How many you end up making depends on the size of the pills. The smaller the pills are, the more pill pockets you'll be able to make.


Wet your hands first. This will make the dough easier to work with.
 You can make these holes using just about anything, from a chopstick to a pencil eraser. The holes need to be wide enough to fit the pill. Also, make sure that they only go ½ to ¾ of the way through each pill.
 They will last about 1 week. If you won't use all of the pills during that time, you will need to freeze them. Line them up on a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper. Freeze them for 1 hour, then transfer them to a freezer-safe container. They will last about 3 months in the freezer.
