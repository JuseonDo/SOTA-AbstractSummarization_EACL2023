 Ideally, it should fit well in the shoulders, but be too big in the body and arms. The shoulders cannot be easily altered for a better fit.;
, Button the shirt up all the way. As this will be difficult while it is inside out if you would like you can do it before turning it inside out, if it is large enough to fit over your head.


If you usually wear button down shirts with undershirts, you should put an undershirt on when doing this.
, Pin the area where the sides of the shirt meet with the pin facing downward vertically. , Measure the amount that you have pinched in. Generally, you want to keep it to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or less, to avoid problems with pockets moving too far to the side. With men’s shirts, you should avoid darting in at the waist during fitting. With women’s shirts, you can pin an extra half inch (1.27 cm) at the waist to create a more fitted look.
 After you pinch and pin the top of the body, measure it to ensure it matches the measurement on the opposite side. You want to alter it equally on both sides.
 If the arm width fine, you can skip this step. Measure to ensure you are taking approximately the same amount off of each side.


Pin horizontally, with the pin tips facing toward the arm cuff.
Move around, sit down and move your arms to ensure you have enough space for movement in the shirt.
, Make sure your thread matches the shirt material.
 Make sure you allow the seam to go inward at the waist if you are hemming a woman’s shirt.


Use a close stitch and back stitch and the top and bottom.
, Try it on to ensure a good fit. Make sure to sit down and move your arms up and down.
 Use sharp fabric scissors.
