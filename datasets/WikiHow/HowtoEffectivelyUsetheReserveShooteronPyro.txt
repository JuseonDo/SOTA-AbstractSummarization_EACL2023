 This may seem like a given, but remember you can't use the reserve shooter if it's not equipped.;
, Hold M1 to burn your enemy for about two seconds to make sure they have taken some damage before you shoot them with the Reserve Shooter. This also causes the target to become panicked and confused.
 After your target is burning, air blast them up into the air by clicking M2.
 While they are up in the air shoot them with the reserve shooter. If done correctly the target should take mini-crit damage.
 If all steps have been correctly followed you should have killed the enemy! Good work!
