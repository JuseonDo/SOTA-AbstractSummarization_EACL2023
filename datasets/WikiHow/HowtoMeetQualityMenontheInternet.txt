 In other words, compose a mission statement and spare no detail. This really is the most important first step, for it helps you organize your thoughts. It all starts with YOU.;
, Have you decided that they're all pigs and swine and wolves? If so, why would you want one in your life? Be grateful for every good guy you see out there - whether he's married or not - for it's proof that there are still good guys in the world.
 When you see another sister getting married to a good guy, be grateful and rejoice with her! The Buddhists call this Mudita - it's the practice of finding joy in someone else's happiness and it's a good habit to establish.

 Inner beauty really does magnetize and inner beauty comes from being your real authentic self.
 Start paying attention to those whispers of the soul. Listen to your heart. If you're a proactive woman, behave like a proactive woman. Above all, don't "act." Be real.

, Men will reveal a lot about themselves by the answer they give to this question.
 If a man uses ugly words to describe his former loves - or worse - the mother of his sweet little children, this is a huge warning sign!

,,, Be honest. Be a little cheeky and sassy. Be bold. And for gosh sakes, don't start your profile with these three words, "I am a...." Start your profile with a favorite poem or quote. Be original.
 Intelligence is very attractive. An error-ridden profile is a real turn-off to smart men and women. If you don't know how to write, get some help from someone who knows the rules of grammar. This is a major point!
