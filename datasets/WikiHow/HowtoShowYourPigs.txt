 It has to have good definition but be sound. Ask the breeder about the hog if you are having trouble.


Select a pig with good muscles.;
, Keep the pig clean. Keep the pig's snout and butt clean when it is exiting the pen.
 Exercise it regularly. Start walking to help the pig lose weight and stay in good condition.


Do not allow the pig to become underweight or overweight.
 Depending on the feed, pick a high protein feed. (This does not mean feed hormones.)

, Tap only on the hogs shoulder to the underarm area on each side. Try if possible to keep your pigs head up to make the top line of your pig look more even. Not too high though.
, Pigs tend to get excited and run around their first time inside a large pen.


Note that this will excitable behavior will occasionally happen even after you work with them. The best thing to do is just to walk past the judge, maintaining eye contact. Don't get upset.
 Do this a few days before the show so that the coat will come out smooth.
, Never put the whip, cane, or pipe in between the judge and the hog.
, Judges like a hog that handles softly.


Don't hit your hog too hard. It will make your pig whine and the judges won't like that.
For showmanship, know the style the judge likes (if possible) and conform to it.
