 Do not make it wet, just moist.;
, Rub it in well, all over the tapestry covering.
, Brush it into a duster pan and have the vacuum handy to catch salt from the floor. If you have a soft brush attachment to your vacuum and a very gentle sucking mode, you might be able to use the vacuum direct on the tapestry but it is a good idea to be cautious of using such power around delicate threads.
 The salt should have removed the dust and will have refreshed the colours of the tapestry like new.
