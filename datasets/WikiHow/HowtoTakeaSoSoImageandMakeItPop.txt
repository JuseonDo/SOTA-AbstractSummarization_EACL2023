, Some of them are:



Photoshop - *.PSD
paint.NET - *.PDN

Paint Shop Pro - *.PSP

This allow you to have the original version to use for other ideas or work.
 Usually a good way to crop is to find the main focus of your picture and take out anything distracting, but feel free to experiment.
 Try changing the image's saturation and/or contrast. Blurring or sharpening also tends make pictures look nice. Don't overdo it on the effects. This one was done in Gimp.
 Use the eyedropper tool to get colors out of your picture for your brushes. Once again, don't add too many.
