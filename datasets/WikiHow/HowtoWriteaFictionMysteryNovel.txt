Grab the pen/pencil and paper and jot down any ideas you'd like for your mystery novel!
Make sure you don't stress yourself if you can't think of any straight away! You'll come up with some really good ideas eventually! You don't have to plan every single detail, just have some rough ideas and a good idea of what MIGHT happen, in your story.
Don't forget the name! Do you want a series or just a random collection of mystery novels which aren't linked? Be thoughtful and imaginative!

Make sure your ideas make sense and sound good, then you can move onto the next step!

Remember: don't do every single little detail like: He grabbed a chocolate biscuit from Manny's biscuit tin.
