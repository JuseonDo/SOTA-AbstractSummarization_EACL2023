 You only need a few simple ingredients to make a healthy and delicious broiled or grilled halibut. Here's what you need:


Halibut steaks
Olive oil or melted butter
Minced garlic
Salt and pepper
Lemon wedges;
,, If you're grilling your halibut, light your grill. Make sure it is heated evenly before proceeding.
 If you're using a grill, place them directly on the grill.
 If you wish, top the butter with a teaspoon or two of minced garlic.
, Test it with a fork for doneness. Serve garnished with a lemon wedge.


Cooked halibut will flake away from the fork easily, while undercooked halibut will still feel solid and fleshy.
Cook halibut without drying it out by watching the cooking time carefully. Grilled halibut should be cooked for no more than 10 minutes per inch thick.
