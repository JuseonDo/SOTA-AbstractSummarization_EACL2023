 Just getting together with your regular partner 1-3 times a week is not enough and may even hurt your game; it will most definitely stop you from improving. You will make the same mistakes over and over, and the game will continue to be a major challenge.


Play more than one player






Play against more than one style






Play against better players






Treat matches as tennis lessons
When practicing, practice with intent--pick specific things to work on and practice your weakest shots

, A good camp will have:


professional tennis instructors who are career tennis instructors






instruction for every level of player
low instructor-to-camper ratio






plenty of competitive match play






at least three hours of instruction per day in addition to match play
