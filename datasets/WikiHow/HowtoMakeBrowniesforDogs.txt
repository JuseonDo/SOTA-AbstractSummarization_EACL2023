 Before you bake these, the oven needs to be the correct temperature.;
, Cut a piece of baking paper with extra length on each end so you can pull them out.
 Use a sharp blade and cut meat into small pieces if your processor has low power.
 This will take approximately three minutes.
 Spread it around with a spoon so the brownies will make an even layer.
 The brownies should be very dry and piping hot.
 Cut into small pieces. Like regular brownies, they are very rich.
 They can keep for a few weeks in the refrigerator.
 These brownies provide a high source of fibre for your dog and the added garlic does wonders for flea prevention.
