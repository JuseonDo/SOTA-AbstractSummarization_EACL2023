 You may want to measure and score the bottle first so you achieve an even cut around the perimeter of the bottle.


Retain the bottle top/lid.
Remove bottle for now and set aside.;
, You want the bottle rest easily on top of the jar, so that the neck of the bottle is facing inside the mason jar.



Knot strings together, creating a loose knot that is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) from the end of the strings.



Place netting over the top of the mason jar.






Thread the strings through the hole, allowing the longer strings to dangle inside the jar.
 Fill jar approximately ¾ of the way. Rocks are only a decorative touch, so they are optional.


Replace netting and cotton wick/strings.
 Put the end of the water bottle pop top on the end of the straw. You should have a decent fit. The straw will go inside the mason jar so cut to fit if needed.


Insert the water tube through the netting hole so it is flush against the cotton wicks and the bottle pop-up top is resting above the netting.
, Fill dirt within ½ inch of the rim.
