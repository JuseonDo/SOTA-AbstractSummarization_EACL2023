 But first, lets get to the storyline;
, Story lines are the most important thing in a video game.With out the story line, the player will start to be confused on why they are on the current level.Take Kingdom Hearts for example. Sora is the wielder of the Keyblade,goes on a journey, going to other worlds finding and doing what he needs to do.
 The storyline is about the keyblade wielder,going around to other worlds and do what has to be done. But Exactly why? why does Sora need to go to these other worlds? without get specific, the player will continue to wonder why.
 A mountain range? Or a savanna?Make a water theme level closer to the beginning so the player can get used to the swimming controls,just in case if there's another water themed level.
 with the storyline and level themes fixed up, it's time for the levels.The level plays the 2nd most important role in the game. without levels, the game is just never ending, like World of Warcraft, there is no levels to play on.
 now you can add the animation of characters, put the enemies into role, and anything else you might want to add into your game. Good Luck!
