think about what other careers you may be able to do with acting skills if you don't make it as the kind of actor you wish to be.

research what you will need to do to achieve your goal.

, For example sales, publicity and marketing positions often require the same kinds of skills. Showing your parents you have sensibly considered an "escape route" if things don't work out should impress them with your mature sensible nature.
 For example:


Research and price acting schools. Each school will have its own style and, more importantly, its own placement rates in various acting careers. Find and choose the one that is right for you.
Honestly evaluate your talent and find areas you are lacking. Perhaps you need to be a better dancer dancer, or singer, or tell better jokes. If these skills are a part of your plan, figure out how you will learn the skills.
