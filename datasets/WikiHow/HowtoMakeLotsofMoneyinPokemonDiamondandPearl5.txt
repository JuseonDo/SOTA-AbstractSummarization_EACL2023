 This needs to be level 40+.
 The player must also have a vs. seeker.
 Either way will lead you to the same place.
 Do not go there. When you pass the stairs, go to route 222. This is the first thing you'll come across.
 Travel slightly up from there. You'll see a trainer sitting there alone. He is a rich boy trainer.
 You will get a lot of money if you win ($4500+). if your lead Pokémon has either a luck incense or Amulet Coin, you'll get double the money, so you'll end up getting around $12000+.


If you have already battled him before, use the vs. seeker near him. He will often battle again.
