 Sleeveless tops work best to create the "little black dress" look, but other sleeve lengths may work as well. Search for a top made of the same material as your skirt so that your ensemble blends together more readily.
 Stilettos, closed-toe pumps, peep-toes, and heeled sandals are all fair game. Select a pair that looks appropriate for the occasion.
 Diamonds and pearls work especially well for formal occasions, but colored costume jewelry will also work as long as you stick with more sophisticated pieces.
, Choose a wrap made of sheer material, and stick with neutral colors like black, white, silver, or gold.
 Look for a black clutch or one that matches the color of your wrap or jewelry.
