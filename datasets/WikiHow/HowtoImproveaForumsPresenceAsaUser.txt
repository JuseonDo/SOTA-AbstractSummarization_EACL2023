 One thing that newcomers look for are the signs of active involvement from other users. If it looks like dead space, odds are that the new user will disappear as fast as they can click out of there, and your reaction would be no different. A lively forum, on the other hand, will have current messages, good interaction between the uses, and a variety of topics going on at the same time. wikiHow's own forums offer a perfect example of good forums. Participate and you'll make it great.;
, Also integrate it into some of your other social media that you are involved with. Examples can include your blog, other forums, even how-to sites.
 Challenge people to think beyond the square and to offer truly mindful opinions about issues that the forum raises.

Some of these are seemingly directed for a photography forum, but could be transposed to your type of forum.
