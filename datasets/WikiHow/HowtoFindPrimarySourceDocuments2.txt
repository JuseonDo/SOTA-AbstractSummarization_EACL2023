Regular public libraries may not have primary source documents. University libraries and the Library of Congress usually include more sources.
Check online databases regardless. Many libraries subscribe to databases that you may be able to use to see abstracts or even the full text of journal articles.
 Contact your school, university, or local public library. One of the librarians can help you.
 Start communicating your request for the sources to entries on this list asking for information on how you may obtain them.
 All libraries can obtain books, articles, and sometimes copies of primary sources, typically delivered to your local library.
