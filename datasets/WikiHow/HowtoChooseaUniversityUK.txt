 Ideally you should start looking for a university about 18 months before commencement of the course and start applying about a year before commencement.

 Would you prefer to live in a busy city neighbourhood or in a quiet town in the countryside? Apart from its impact on your lifestyle, location will have a huge impact on your cost of living. Cities are generally more expensive than towns, even when you live in university accommodation. London and the southeast are the most expensive. On the other hand, if you would like to have a part-time job while you study, a city will give you more work opportunities.
 Do you prefer to live close to your family and friends or are you the adventurous type?
