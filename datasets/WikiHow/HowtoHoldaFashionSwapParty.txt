 The best way of doing this is with emails. In the email, make sure that you tell your friends what it's all about. For example:Hi Fashion lovers! I have decided that I need some new clothes, but I don't want to spend any money, so I have decided to throw a FASHION SWAP PARTY! I came to this decision after looking through my closet and seeing all these great clothes that I'm a bit tired of but I know some of you might love. So if you want renew your closet then keep Saturday night free from 5:30pm onwards. Please bring as many clothes as you can. The more you bring the more you get. Please be sure that you wash and press all your items. Try to have them in a condition that you would like other people's clothes to be. Please RSVP. Emily.;
, Mark them as Cheap, Mid-price and Expensive.
 Make sure you leave a spot for people to put their names. A good thing to do is go to the newsagent and pick up 3 different coloured post-it notes, one colour for each pile.
 For each item they put down, give them a corresponding ticket and tell them to put their names on each.
,, Reach in and pick out a ticket (you can ask random people to do this to make it more fun.)

, So, for example, if a ticket says EMILY and MID-PRICE, then Emily can go and pick something from the Mid-price pile.
, If there is an objection then you can play a game to see who gets the item. There are heaps of games (see Tips). Whoever wins the game gets the item.
