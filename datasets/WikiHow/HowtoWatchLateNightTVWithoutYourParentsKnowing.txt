, If you plan on setting your clock, stick your head and the clock under the pillow so only you hear it. If not, just pretend you're asleep when your parents come out of their room.
 You can imagine the rest.
 When the show you want is on, turn to a channel that you watch during the day, then turn directly to the program. Then hit channel return on the remote and it should turn back to the other channel with the push of a button. This way you can quickly flip between the two shows if your mom comes in your room.
, Then you can say you "just couldn't fall asleep so decided to watch some TV to make you sleepy" and your parents won't get mad because they'll think you're watching something childish and appropriate.
 Although the creators of the shows don't seem to understand this, you're much more likely to buy their merchandise or episodes on DVD if you have actually been able to watch the show.
, Then delete ALL of your history. If the show has subtitles, watch it without the volume or put the volume really low so you can hear if your parents are coming. When they do come in, pretend to be doing homework.
