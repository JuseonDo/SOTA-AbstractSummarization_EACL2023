Great combos include:(4 player team) 3x Rifleman 1x support gunner, 4x snipers, 2x Rifleman 1x support and 1x Designated Marksman or 2x Rifleman and 2x support gunners.
 They will often hold up to 4,000
Buy an extra battery - you WILL need it. Valken batteries, Lipo batteries and Intellect batteries are great quality.
,, Set up your weapon with a clear view of the enemy position or objective.


Buy and utilize a bipod..they can be lifesavers.
Do not be afraid to go prone (lie down) because it is harder for the OPFOR (opposing force) to see you with a low profile ( keep in mind this will make it harder to get up if in a hurry)

Try to hit the cover around the enemy that is very loud when hit: metal objects...
Remember that you are not necessarily trying to get one enemy, you are just trying to pin their entire team down... So you should not focus on one guy, try to fire on the objective as a whole
Fire off a burst to pin the enemy, then hold your fire, when you see him pop back out of cover, open fire again and pin him back down before he can hit your team.
As a support gunner it is your job to listen to your team, and find where they need cover fire
If you are "stingy" with ammo the support role is not for you, your job is to cover your squad mates movement and ammo will be your best friend.

Always be looking for easily defensible positions with lots of cover.
