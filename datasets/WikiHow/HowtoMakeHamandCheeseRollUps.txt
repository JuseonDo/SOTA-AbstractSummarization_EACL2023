,, Take care not to tear them as you unfold and pull apart the triangles.
 For those allergic to dairy products, skip this step and move on to the next one.
 Add as much ham as you'd like. For vegetarians, skip this step and simply rely on the cheese from the previous step.
 From the widest part, roll the crescent pastry up to the thinner part. See the image for detail.
 Place the completed ham and cheese roll-ups in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until they turn golden brown.


Take them out when they're done with an oven mitt. Wait at least five minutes before eating. After that, enjoy and eat up!
