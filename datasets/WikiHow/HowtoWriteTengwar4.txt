 In this mode the tehta is read first, then the tengwa. Therefore, vowels are placed on the letter after them.
 A diphthong is a pair of vowels pronounced as a single sound. All other vowel combinations are pronounced as individual vowels (I know that I'm repeating this in each method, but it's in case you've just skipped straight to this mode without reading the others).
 Sindarin has four double letters: nn, mm, ll and ss. Note that the underbar is only used to double ll and ss.
 The above table gives the values for this mode.
