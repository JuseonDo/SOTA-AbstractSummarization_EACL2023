 Place the entire half a roll in a resealable plastic container. Ensure you choose a safe plastic container. Plastic containers have been linked to health risks. You can also use an old plastic wipe container, but you will need to accordion fold each wipe to fit them in there.
 Mix 1 Â¾ cups warm sterile water, 1 tablespoon pure aloe vera, 1 tablespoon pure witch hazel extract, 2 tablespoons organic liquid soap, and optional essential oils.


Stir these ingredients to combine.
 Let them absorb the mixture for at least 10 minutes.
 Remove the paper towel tube and store it in an air-tight container.
