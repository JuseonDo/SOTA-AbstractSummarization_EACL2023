Some heat protection sprays also have built in frizz control.
 This will help your hair retain moisture while you blow dry it. One of the reasons hair might appear frizzy is because it is dry and damaged.
 It is also great for those who would like to blow dry their hair straight. The nozzle will help direct the airflow better while you are blow drying your hair. It will help the hair cuticles lay flatter, and in turn, make your hair appear smoother.
