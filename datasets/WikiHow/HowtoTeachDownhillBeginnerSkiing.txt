 Remind them that racing is for more experienced skiers. Also, remind them of all the rules of the ski area that you are in, including rules about "Right of Way."

, Remind them to listen for the click and check to make sure the skis are on right by jumping up and down a few times.
 If they are, teach them how to use the poles properly, and how to put the pole straps on before you go on any run.
 There are many different types of ski lifts. For a chair lift, remind them to wait behind the line and then go as fast as they can before the next chair comes around.
 Different ski areas have different criteria for beginners, so make sure that the run doesn't have anything you might call steep or icy. You might want to check it out before you take the beginner up there.
 They can either "snowplow" by pointing their toes together, or simply turn uphill, which will always work.
 Demonstrate, so they can follow your tracks in the snow. Have them turn, and stop, for the rest of the run, unless they feel that they can try to make 2 turns, then stop.
 When they fall, tell them to get right back up again!
