 Don't put it in the fridge! It needs to stay warm to be malleable.
 Start from the inside and roll outward.
 For a bunch of bows, this is ideal -- but for one large bow, you may want to go bigger. A pastry cutter will ensure a straight line, but a knife does just fine as well.

The length of the strips can also vary, but should generally be four to six times the width. For one thick bow, cut a strip about 3" (7.5 cm) wide and a strip 1" (2.5 cm) wide to adhere the center.
 This will hold the fondant together.
 Press the ends to stick them together. Pinch the center of the bow to give it texture. Do this by flipping it over and folding it in. Start in the center, pinching, and force in the edges.

Insert a bunch of plastic wrap inside the loops to round them out. Stretch out the center of the bow loops to give it a ribbon-like appearance.
 Use longer strips for the lower loops, if you're layering them.
 Wet the back of the piece with water and curve the piece before you adhere it. Pinch and twist off the back.

Adjust as necessary, fluffing out the sides and adding texture by stretching and folding.
 This will give your cake a gift-wrapped look.

Also add any trailing ends of ribbon. If you'd like, cut a V shape in the end of the fondant for a more ribbon-y feel and pinch the ends closest to the bow.
 Put a bit of water on the back side to adhere it to the base. Voila!
