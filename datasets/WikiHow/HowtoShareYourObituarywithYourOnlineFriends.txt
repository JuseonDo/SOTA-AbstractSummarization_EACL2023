 This could be a spouse, a child, a parent, an attorney, or even a neighbor.;
,, Go through your e-mail address book and think about who you would like to have notified after you pass on and how. Leave specific instructions for your representative, such as:


How to log into your e-mail account
Send a specific message to certain people
Send a general message to everyone in the address book
Set up an automatic reply to anyone who writes to your e-mail address
Delete the account after a specified period of time has passed

, Are you a regular contributor? Surely other users will appreciate being notified after your death. Maybe you are a read-only member. Nonetheless, you may still want to have the group notified after your death if you feel the group has helped you and you want to express your appreciation.
 List the name of the group or service sponsoring the online community, the URL or website address or, if the group is accessed by posting an email, give the appropriate email address.
 Can he simply email an administrator? Will he have to create his own account and log on in order to send a message? Work this out now so that you can give full instructions which you know are going to work later, when your representative tries to notify the group.
 Perhaps you simply want your representative to make a simple statement indicating the date and place of your death. Or perhaps you want to prepare a paragraph now which can be uploaded to the group later. This may be particularly useful if you are currently planning for your death due to a terminal illness. Maybe you prefer to instruct your representative to simply upload your newspaper obituary. There are many ways to approach it. The point is to go ahead and plan now, before it becomes too late.
