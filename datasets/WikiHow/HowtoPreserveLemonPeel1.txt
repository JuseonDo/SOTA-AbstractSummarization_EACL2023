cut around blemished sections of the lemons.the "cut into lemons" will need to be used first for your project, or stored in the refrigerator until you use them.blemishes are not always terrible, but if you are going to be making something like jelly and or sugared lemon, you'd probably not want to eat an unsightly dark spot on a piece of lemon, so it's best to just dispose of them.

 Some people are lucky enough to have lemon trees in their yards, or live next to someone who does.


Sometimes lemon trees and shrubs have sharp spiky thorns, so wear protective clothing and gloves.If you have a very tall tree, use a lemon picker.Or, better yet, grab a friend and get two lemon pickers (or more).;
, One group is those with only superficial blemishes on the skin and the second group is those with deeper bruises or blemishes.This is an important step if you have a large supply of hand-picked lemons.
Separate them into two bags, or bowls. If you have help, have one person wash one group while you wash another, discarding any lemons that appear moldy or infected.
Pat the lemons dry or let them air dry in an area with good air circulation, because they can start to rot if they sit in water too long.
 If you are using the lemons right away, you can skip this step.


Lemons last longer in a plastic bag in the refrigerator, nearly four times as long as being left out at room temperature.,
If you want, juice the cut lemons right away. See Making and Freezing Lemon Juice, below.
