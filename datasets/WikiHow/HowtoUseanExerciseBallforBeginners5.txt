@summary
stand with your back to a wall.

@summary
lean back against the ball and walk your feet forward one to three paces.

@summary
engage your abs, remain leaning against the ball, and lower yourself into a squat.

hold the squat for 10 to 20 seconds.
@article
 Place the exercise ball between yourself and the wall, at your lower back.
 The distance you step forward depends on the length of your legs.
 Your knees should be in line with your ankles and your thighs parallel to the floor.


If your knees extend over your ankles, or are behind your ankles, adjust the position of your feet.
 Push back up to standing. Repeat the squat at least 10 times.
