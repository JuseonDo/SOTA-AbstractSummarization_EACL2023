 It will also help if your parents are at the door or place where you are being dropped off for the night. Ask if they could come up to the door with you so that you can say goodnight.
 If you are staying with friends while your parents are out of town, if there are events planned such as church or a school function, you will be more comfortable having your own clothes.
 Don't bring a lot of toys but you should bring things that make you comfortable.
