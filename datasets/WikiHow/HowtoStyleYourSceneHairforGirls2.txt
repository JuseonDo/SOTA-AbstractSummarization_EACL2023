 This will give you the opportunity to control as much of your hair as possible while you sculpt your look.
 If you blow dry with your head upright, it can flatten your hair and make it much harder to style.

Use your hands and a comb to pull sections of hair out and up.
Comb down and adjust each piece the way you want it too fall.
Don't make things too uniform. With the right shape and volume, you can treat your hair like a canvas and express yourself with different colors, layers, and accessories.
