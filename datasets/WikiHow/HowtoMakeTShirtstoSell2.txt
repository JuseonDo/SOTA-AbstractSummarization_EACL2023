 Depending on the business, having your decals made can take a few days up to a week or longer. Once they are ready, pick them up at the store.
 Be careful when using the heat press machine. It can reach upwards of a couple of 100 degrees. Read the directions thoroughly before you attempt to use this machine.
 Make sure it is centered and has no wrinkles in it. Place the decal onto the shirt. Make sure you centered the decal in the middle of the shirt.
 The beep lets you know when the shirt is ready.
 Place it on the hanger and set it to the side. You can continue making the personalized t-shirts until all of the decals are used up.
