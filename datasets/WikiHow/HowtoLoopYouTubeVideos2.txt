 You cannot loop using the YouTube app, so you'll need to use a special app that will loop for you.
,,,, This appears after installation is complete. You can also tap the ListenOnRepeat app in your app list.
, The app uses the same search as YouTube, so you should be able to easily find your videos.
, Your video will continue to loop until you stop it or close the app.
