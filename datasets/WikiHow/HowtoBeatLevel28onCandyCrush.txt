 Only two of the stones have double-jelly under them, and these are both in the vertical column running through the middle of the board. This means that while you need to focus on clearing out the stones as well (since the jelly squares are sandwiched between them) that is not the main purpose of this level.;
,, Make sure to use these at the bottom of the board, near jelly. Donâ€™t waste them on clearing out squares that have no jelly in them.
 Using one as soon as it's created is not the best idea, since down the line you might find a piece of jelly that you can't clear otherwise. Wait till you've run out of all other options and then strategically use it to clear jelly that cannot be cleared. In the screenshot below, a color bomb that was made when there were eleven moves yet was used in the last few moves to remove the blue candy to help clear out the gameboard.
 Since they can clear out an entire row or column, they can be very useful in a level with such few allowed moves.
