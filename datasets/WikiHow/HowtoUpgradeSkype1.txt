 You can upgrade Skype whether or not you are logged in.


If the update is urgent, you will be notified about it as soon as Skype launches.;
,, The download will usually take just a few moments.
 Windows may prompt you to allow the update installer to run.
 You may be asked to select your language before the upgrade begins. You will also be asked to review the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
 You may be asked if you want to install the Skype plugin for your browser. This plugin allows you to click phone numbers in your web browser and dial them with Skype.


If you don't want to install it, uncheck the box.
 You may be asked if you want to set your browser home page and default search engine to Bing. These options are usually checked by default.
 This may take a few minutes. If you are logged into Skype, you will be logged out during the upgrade process.
 When the upgrade is complete, you will be prompted to enter your username and password again. Enter them and click "Sign In" to start using your upgraded Skype program.
 If the upgrade won't download or doesn't install correctly, the quickest way to fix it is to uninstall and reinstall Skype. You won't lose your contacts or message history.
