 Some will have their own department for handling customers' courier needs, while others use an outside company. Some may use a courier broker, who works with several companies to match couriers with customers. Ask the airlines what companies they have worked with.;
, To be an air courier, you must be at least 18 years old and have a valid passport. Courier companies also require that you maintain a professional appearance.
 The more flexible you are, the better your chance of getting a steeply discounted airfare. You can get the best rates, and may be able to travel for free, if you can be ready to travel on very short notice.
 Your cargo will probably count as your checked baggage, leaving you with only a carry-on bag for your flight. If you are able to stay at your destination for several days before returning home (the courier company determines when this will be), you will have to live out of your carry-on.
 If you don't, you will not be offered another opportunity to act as an air courier.
