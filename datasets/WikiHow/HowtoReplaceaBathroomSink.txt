 When you install a new sink, you want one that will fit in the old countertop. Write down the length, depth and width of the sink, as well as the length and width of the countertop.;
, Bring the measurements of the old sink and countertop with you to ensure you purchase the correct size before putting in a bathroom sink.
 The cut off handle is usually located under the sink. When replacing a bathroom washbasin, you want to test the faucets to make sure the water is completely off.
 When you install a new sink, you have to remove the drainage pipe first.


Loosen the bolts that attach the P-trap to the bottom of the sink with channel lock pliers.
Hang the P-trap over the bucket, carefully pulling it from the sink.
 Replacing a bathroom washbasin entails spending a little time underneath the sink removing hardware.
,, When putting in a bathroom sink, you want a smooth surface, so clean the countertop off, removing any residual silicon.
, To install a new sink, you should seal the hardware. Be sure to apply a bead of silicone caulk to the faucet and drain base. If you bought a new faucet, follow the manufacturer's directions.
 Lower the sink into the hole in the countertop. Push the washbasin into place and wipe off any excess silicone with paper towels.
 You need to make sure it is secure.
 Be careful not to tighten the valves too tight.


Turn the water valves back on. Leave the bucket under the P-trap while you test the sink for leaks. Sometimes, putting in a bathroom sink creates water leakage.
Twist on the hot water and then the cold water. If there is a leak, shut off the water and re-install the connections wrapping plumber's tape around the stem of the hose.
