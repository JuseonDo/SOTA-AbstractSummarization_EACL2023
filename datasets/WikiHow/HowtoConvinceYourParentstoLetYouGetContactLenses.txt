 Find out if they actually suit you. Ask friends and family who have contacts about them.;
, This proves that you're willing to keep up with a new responsibility. Don't yell or scream about contact lenses or glasses, because that will just show your parents how immature you are, and immature children can't look after contact lenses. Instead, just talk calmly about them, try to prove to them you are mature by discussing things maturely like an adult.
 Glasses are often uncomfortable during sports and maybe your favorite sunglasses brand doesn't come in prescription. Glasses can also hide a pretty face.
 Maybe there is a misunderstanding that can be solved easily.
, You can make an excuse to go to the doctor in the first place, such as needing to get your prescription checked. This is an especially important step, as your parents will most likely listen to your optometrist or ophthalmologist if they say you are a good candidate for contacts. Ask if you can try some trial lenses.
 This is one of the strongest arguments if it applies to you, because your parents most likely will not want to argue when it comes to your vision being as strong as it can be.
, Make sure to take out your contacts and clean them every night. Wear them for the prescribed amount of time.
 A year's supply of Acuvue 2 is typically about $120 to $160. Focus monthlies are about $80 to $120 for a year's supply, but they are not for everyone. Contact lens exams are also more than those for glasses only - typically a contact lens exam is about $70 to $100.
 Either tell them you can handle it, or just stick with glasses. You can always get a new pair of glasses if you don't like your old pair.
