A journal can range from a ream of paper or notebook to an online template. Choose something that inspires you or promotes positive feelings and is easy to maintain. If you choose to use your computer, make sure your file is easily accessible, perhaps placing it on your desktop.;

List things such as your starting weight and height, measurements and body mass index (BMI). The inside cover of your journal, or the first page of your online journal is a good place to list these things.
Choose a time once a week to check your statistics to see if there is any change.



Make this the first page or 2 of your journal so you will read it daily.
Make goals attainable, so you will not become discouraged. Consider multiple goals: short term, medium term and long term.
Start with easy goals, such as drinking 8 glasses of water per day, or giving up midnight snacks.



Think about how you can achieve these goals. What is realistic and what can you incorporate in your schedule?
