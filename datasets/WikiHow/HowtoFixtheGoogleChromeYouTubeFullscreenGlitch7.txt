 Some Chrome users experiencing issues with full screen mode in YouTube have reported that disabling their Chrome theme fixed the problem.A Chrome theme is an extension you can install from the Chrome store that changes the way Chrome looks (colors, backgrounds, etc).


Note that if you have no theme installed, this method won’t be helpful.
, You may have to scroll down to find it.
 Chrome will now revert to its original look and feel.
 Select any YouTube video and click the full screen icon (the square at the bottom right corner of the video) to launch it in full screen. If the video takes up the entire screen, great! If not, try another method.
