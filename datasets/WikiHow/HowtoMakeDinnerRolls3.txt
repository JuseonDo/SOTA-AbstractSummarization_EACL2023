 This recipe makes about 1 1/2 dozen rolls of moderate size. If you don't have a muffin tin, you can use a 13x9-inch pan instead.
 Bring it to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
 Ideally, it'll be somewhere between 90°F and 110°F -- definitely warm, but not too hot to touch.


This should take about 10 minutes. If you place the tip of your finger in the liquid and hold it there, you should be fine. Don't try this too soon! The last thing you want is to burn yourself.
 Once it's blended, cover it and let it rise for about an hour. It should nearly double in size. Plastic wrap is best, but a towel will work too.
 Combine it well until it looks like a perfect bread dough.
 You should end up with 54 small balls. Calm down -- place three balls into each muffin cup. We're not making rolls for an army, here.
 You'll want to tuck most of it under the tops of the dough balls, so when it bakes it doesn't crust on top. You want that cheesy goodness preserved!

, If any cheese overflows from the tin, spoon it back onto the rolls. You want them cheesy, right?

, Transfer to a cooling rack to allow to cool completely. Then try not to eat them all!
