@article
 Press âˆ† once Agro is near to mount her.;
, Look around the area until the light reflecting off the sword centralizes on a particular area on the southwest part of the map, or quadrant G5.
 You'll see that there are two branching paths, take the one on the left and continue along this path until you come out of a canyon.
 After a while, you will reach a grassy area.
 A cut scene will play, after which you will fight Phaedra.
 Immediately run toward the tunnel system you saw on your way to Phaedra's lair. It's a large mound of dirt with 3 holes (caves) that serve as entryways.
 Do this until Phaedra comes over to stamp on you - hide inside one before he can.
 He will start stomping on the ground. You'll notice tremors and dust falling from the ceiling of the tunnels.
 Do not exit the one you climbed through as the colossus will be waiting for you there.
, When it does this, you'll see that there's a part of Phaedra's tail that you can climb on.
 Climb up its back and continue moving toward the neck.
 This should be at the midsection of its neck.


Be careful that you don't waste too much stamina or you'll fall.
 Phaedra will eventually lower its head, and the real weak point will appear.
 This will lead you to the main weak point.
 Continue stabbing the weak point until the colossus dies.
