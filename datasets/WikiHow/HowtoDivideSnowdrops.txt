 The snowdrops can be divided after the flowers have died off but when the plants are still "in the green";
, Be careful not to stick the tines of the fork through the bulbs.
 Do this gently. This will help you to see what is being divided.
 Leave both roots and leaves attached to each bulb pulled out of the clump.
 These are also capable of forming new plants if they're in good condition. However, do note that these will take longer to form than the other bulbs pulled away.
, Dig holes large enough to fit the bulbs, breaking up any soil clumps in the bottom of the holes.


A trowel or hand fork work best for digging small bulb holes.
 Place each bulb upright in its selected hole. Press into the soil firmly.
 Cover the bulb as appropriate to ensure the right depth.
 Do this by patting it down with the flat of your hands.
 Keep an eye on the soil moisture––don't over water or the bulb risks rotting.
