 Once you lock your iPad, it won't turn when you rotate the screen, so rotate it first to orient the screen how you'd like.
 This allows you to quickly adjust the settings for your iPad.
 This will toggle the Orientation Lock, which will prevent your iPad’s screen from rotating. The button will turn white when it is toggled “On”.


If you see a Mute button instead of the Lock Rotation button, click here.
 If you want to enable the screen rotation again, open the Control Panel and toggle the button.
