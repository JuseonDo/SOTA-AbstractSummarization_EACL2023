 Do not use a wine to cook if you would never drink it in a glass or serve it with food.


Start with a basic red or white wine. An example of a good white to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc. Try Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon for a red.
Avoid using wines that are labeled "cooking wines." These wines contain a lot of salt and other additives and you would never drink them in a glass.;
, Think of it as similar to a seasoning. Too little wine will be lost, and too much will be overpowering.


Start with small amounts, and add gradually. Remember that you can always add more wine, but you cannot take back what you have already put in.
 Wine will provide the moisture that the water would have helped with, and add a nice flavor to what you are cooking.
 Wine that is room temperature can tenderize meats. You can also marinate vegetables in wine before you grill, roast, sauté or bake them.
 Stir in 1 or 2 tbsp. at a time until you reach the flavor you desire.
 This will work for meat and vegetables. Heat the wine before you add the food but do not let the wine boil or it will lose flavor.
 Use sherry in recipes for baked goods, or splash some wine over ice cream or cheesecake.
 You can mix the wine with oil or melted butter as well as a stock, or use it on its own.
 It can make a nice sauce if you reduce it over time.


Warm wine before you add food to a pan as well. Heating the wine before you cook food in it will provide more moisture to the food and prepare the pan or pot for cooking.
 The more you use wine in your recipes and cooking, the better you will be able to predict the taste and flavor.
