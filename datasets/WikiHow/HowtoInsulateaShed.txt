 There is no use insulating the walls if the windows are gapped or broken.;
, If you are going to use it for a guest room or home office, this is essential, since single glazed windows will allow a large amount of heat loss and depending on which side your shed faces, let a lot of heat in during summer.
 Seal thin gaps with caulk. Use expandable spray foam for larger holes.
 Install a roof with a good drainage system. You can use shingles, metal roofing or fiberglass.


In the absence of rain, use a garden hose and spray it over the roof. Look inside for signs of leakage., Filling holes and establishing a barrier between the outside is important if you are going to keep the temperature constant inside the shed. Look for dark stains in the walls to identify water leaks in the shed.
 Most shed kits don’t come with a weatherproof model. You may need to purchase a custom size if your shed door is smaller than a standard home door.
 Hire an electrician to ensure it will be safe. Extension cords from the house are not safe.
 This space will dictate the width of the sheets or batting you are going to buy.
 These standard wall sizes allow for you to roll out and secure the insulation between studs, joists and beams. It is relatively expensive and best on unfinished walls.
 They are fairly thin but work well, although they are not recommended if you have a lot of electrical outlets.
 Keep in mind that wool will need regular upkeep and maintenance. Without proper cleaning, wool will break down and rot over time from its natural dirt and oils. Although fiberglass insulation is a similar option, it must be covered or it is unsafe for humans.
 You can cut holes into the walls and blow the insulation into the frame., It is flexible, so that it can bend around corners or other obstructions., Some of these methods require special equipment.
 They should help you to purchase enough to cover the shed. They will require your stud spacing measurements as well.
 Set the polystyrene against the frame.
 Staple it into the studs.You will need to glue polystyrene sheets onto the walls and studs with a special adhesive.
 Continue moving up the wall in horizontal sheets. You can cut the insulation sheets with scissors to make a smaller section.
 You will need to leave at least a two-inch gap between the top of the ceiling and the insulation to let moisture escape.
 You will want to hang the sheets on the ceiling first, followed by wall sheets.
