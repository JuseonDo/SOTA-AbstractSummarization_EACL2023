 If you have a PS3, disconnecting it will prevent your controller from attempting to sync with your PS3 rather than your Mac.
 To ensure this, you can do a couple different things:


When connected to a PS3, hold down the PlayStation button and select "Turn off Controller".
When disconnected but still on, insert a paperclip into the reset hole near the L2 button., This should go in one of the rectangular USB slots in the side of your Mac's casing.
 This is the Apple-shaped icon in the top left corner of your Mac's screen.
 This will open your Bluetooth menu.


If your Bluetooth detection isn't already on, turn it on by clicking the "On" and "Discoverable" checkboxes.
 Let go when the red light near the PlayStation button flashes; this indicates that your PS3 controller has reset its default sync settings.
 Your PS3 controller should now be syncing to your Mac.
 This will prompt you to enter an access code.
 Exclude the quotation marks and click "Pair" when you're done.On some operating systems, this will say "Accept" instead of "Pair".
 It should display as "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller".
 This is in the toolbar at the bottom of the Bluetooth menu.
 This will ensure that your PS3 controller is locked into your Mac's settings.
 Although there aren't many games released for Mac, your PS3 controller should work with any that are!
