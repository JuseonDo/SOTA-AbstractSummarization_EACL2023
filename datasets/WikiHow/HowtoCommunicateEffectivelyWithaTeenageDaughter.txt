 If you know what she likes and dislikes, this will give you common ground.;
, Don't be overbearing with this one. Maybe you could start small.Write a little note and stick it on her mirror. Make her cookies. Give her a ride somewhere. Come to her games or plays.
 She is young and is still figuring things out. Teach her what she did wrong if she's made a mistake, but make sure she knows you still love her. Let her know that you forgive her and understand that everybody makes mistakes.
 This is true for every single teenage girl, whether they show it on the outside or not. Just because she yells at you doesn't mean she hates you. If she does, it's probably because she has reached the end of her rope and doesn't know how to react to her situation. Let her cry if she needs to. Cry with her, but not too much. Rejoice with her. Be a strong anchor for her while her emotions are unsettled from hormones, lack of sleep, and too much going on.
 Find activities you both enjoy and spend time together.
 This is a big one. Try to see what circumstances and emotions are making her think the ways she does.
 This is huge. When a teenage daughter knows that they can go to their parent(s) with concerns, problems, and joys, it makes communication meaningful and easy.
