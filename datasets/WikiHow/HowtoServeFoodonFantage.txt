, It's the cruise ship at the Beach.
 Click on them to go to Chez Fantage.
 You will also see a sign near the counter that says "New waiter costume!". Click that.
 Waiter/waitress costumes will pop up. Almost all of them are for premium members except for one. There is a BUY sign under all of them. Click one and click buy with stars and or buy with ecoins.
 Wear the waiter/waitress costume and go to a spot near the counter. A menu will pop up with the food/drink options.
 Let's say a customer orders spaghetti. You would go to the food section and click the spaghetti.
 To actually serve the customer you need to know which side of the table the costumer is on. So if this costumer is on the right side of the table, click the right side of the table. The costumer might give you a tip.
