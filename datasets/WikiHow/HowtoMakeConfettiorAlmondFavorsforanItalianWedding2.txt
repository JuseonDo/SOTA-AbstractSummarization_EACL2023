 Choose colors that coordinate with the wedding ceremony or pick a favorite color of the bride or groom.
 Consider using items such as small boxes, baskets, containers, decorative bags, dishes or glassware.
 Think about using items such as ribbon, flowers, labels with the wedding date written on them or name place cards for the reception table. Trim double-sided tape to fit underneath the item you wish to place on your holder. Remove backing from each side of the tape. Adhere the decorations to the holders.
 Use mini cupcake holders for smaller favors. Trim tissue paper with scissors to fit the scale of your holder.
