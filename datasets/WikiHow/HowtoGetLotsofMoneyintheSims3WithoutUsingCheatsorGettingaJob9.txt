 If you can control the dog, while playing as your dog, click anywhere outside, select the Digging... option, and then select the Dig interaction (it will be the only interaction on the list). If you can't control your dog, get your Sim to use the Teach To Dig interaction on your dog often (if you use this too much on your dog, however, your dog will get the Brain Hurts moodlet and you will not be able to teach your dog anything for several hours).
 This will dig a hole and you will possibly find something buried underground.
 You will probably only dig up something like iron or a seed instead of a gem. Sell it anyway. After a while of digging, you will find things that are even more rare and valuable which means that they will sell for much more money.
