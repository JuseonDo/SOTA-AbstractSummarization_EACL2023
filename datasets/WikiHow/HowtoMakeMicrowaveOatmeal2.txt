 Oatmeal expands while it is being cooked. The large bowl will keep the oatmeal from overflowing and making a mess. You can always put the oatmeal into a smaller serving bowl when you are done cooking it.
 This is enough for one serving. If you'd like to make more servings, you'll need to finish cooking this one first.


You are only adding part of the water for now. You will add the rest later. Steel Cut oats cook differently than other types.
 Your oats won't be cooked all the way through just yet. You will be alternating between microwaving and adding water until the oats are cooked through.


You do not need to cover the bowl.
 You may notice the oats soaking up water and becoming "meatier."

, After each minute, pause the microwave and stir the oats. This will keep the oatmeal from boiling out of the bowl.
 Use a potholder to handle the bowl, as it will be very hot. Set the bowl down on a heat-safe surface.
 At this point, you can add goodies such as cinnamon, honey, or raisins. Click here for more ideas.
 This will give the oats enough time to absorb any excess water. It will also allow the oatmeal to cool down enough to eat.
