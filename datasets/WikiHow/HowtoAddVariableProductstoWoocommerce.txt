, Under the General tab you can fill a SKU number in for your product. Then select the Inventory tab and do not select Manage Stock.


You can say the item is in stock if it is, and you can allow back orders if you want to.
 Click the attributes tab and then we will select custom product attribute and then click the add button. After that you can fill give your variable a name. For example, you might choose size, length or whatever your variable is.
 It is they key next to the left shift button on UK keyboards. If your variable is length then you just fill in the length increments your product comes in, or dress sizes, you will know what sizes your product comes in. Remember to tick the "used for variations" box. You can then click on the save attributes button before proceeding.
 You then click on the variations tab, and then you will click on the add variation button. You can then select the relevant variation, in this case the shoe size, and then fill in all the relevant boxes such as your price.

 You can select the variable (size) and then fill in the details again. You do this for as many variables your product might have that you want to sell.
 You can then click on the right hand side to add a product image.
, If you did it correctly you should be able to select the different variables for your product. In my case it is the different sizes for the golf shoe.
