 Of course, it might be hard to do this if you live in the city, but you can always learn a lot about space and the night, you should build up your knowledge on things about the night.;
, After a hard day, this can be like heaven.
 Princesses are smart, and know a lot of things, you should too.
 Even if it doesn't come true, it might make you feel better. Be dreamy and mysterious too, you're not any normal princess.
 If you are daring enough, lift your voice and sing. Try to take singing lessons, make your voice nice.
 After all, you're a princess, but you should also experiment with other clothes. Study on what types suit you're body. Also putting little bits of sparkle into your outfits to signify the stars.
 The little shimmer you add, will look the stars, and add to the look. Star and moon earrings, necklaces, etc. are also great!

, A real princess treats others kindly. Be well mannered, be patient and really loyal to your friends and family.
 Otherwise, just use a good conditioner, and shampoo, anything.
 Draw and paint a lot, sketch or paint things related to the nighttime.
 You need to look good too. It's a princess's job to look well.
 You don't have to, but cats are out at night, which can be a plus. But you could just have a stuffed animal, but just remember how much of a responsibility this is. If you already have one, great! Stay by it a lot and give it a lot of love (but don't annoy it).
