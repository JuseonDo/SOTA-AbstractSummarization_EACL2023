, Even if it is not a car stereo or deck, a simple MP3 player or an iPod with portable speakers can do the trick.
 Avoid salty snacks. Fruits are always preferable. They not only give you energy but are also tasty in-between-meal snacks.
 Even small things such as a rag cloth or a first aid kit can make a difference.
 You must not be in a hurried state of mind. That will only tire you quickly and make it even more difficult for you to sustain yourself throughout the long drive.
 On long drives, the last thing you would want would be to subject your ears to rock or metal music in short bursts. This will only increase the fatigue factor and induce boredom at critical moments. soulful rock or instrumentals are the best.
 have light meals but eat at regular intervals. You would not want to drive on an empty stomach. That would be disaster as driving is energy sapping. Lots of fluids throughout the journey is the best way to tackle the situation.
 Though this is contrary to the popular maxim, do not try out new and dangerous roads even if you have the vehicle to do it. Inclement weather coupled with rocky roads is a deadly combination.
 This will only stress you out. Take each mile as it comes. Some might take a while whereas some might get over before even you know it!

, Fresh air can wake you up and keep you alert.
 When you are driving on a plain unoccupied road, it is very easy to go too fast.
 Long drives are one of the best ways to relax and be with yourself! You will actually get to know yourself better!
