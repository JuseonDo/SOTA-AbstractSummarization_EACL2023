, Use this method if the seam will be very close to the fabric edge, if you are not very skilled, or if the fabric is very thick or uneven.
 The line made by chalk will be wider and more irregular than the wax pencil The ball point pen makes a durable and fine line. Use the wax pencil on fine or smooth fabrics only when sewing directly over the line, because with coarse fabrics the line will be blotchy. With a wax pencil always keep the point small to make a fine line.
 Instead sew on the edge of the chalk markings. This method can be done with a wax pencil on rough fabrics. Since chalk is not durable, handle the fabric with care.

Measure
Iron and allow the fabric dry.
Pin, baste, pin and baste, or double baste depending on what is needed.
Test removing the wax or ink. Use undiluted rubbing alcohol and on a dry fabric only. After working the rubbing alcohol, into the fabric, rinse the alcohol out by placing it under running water.
Have some sewing skills by practicing on easier projects.
