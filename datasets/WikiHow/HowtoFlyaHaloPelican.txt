 Have the ID code handy for the next step's download.;
, This program is called Halo Custom Edition (Also known as Halo CE. You can find this program by following this URL: Download and selecting "download now". Don't worry - this site has been triple checked for harmful viruses. The download is free but could take awhile... get some food. Popcorn, cereal, tea.
 Once you have halo CE downloaded, give it its own special icon.
 This leads to a map called "Huge***". Inappropriate name I suppose, but that's its name. Once again, simply scroll down and hit the download button.
 Once the map you've gotten is downloaded, it should create its own zip folder on your desktop called 'huge***.zip'. This is good. Double click the zip folder. You should see a number of random files, but look for the one titled: 'huge***.map'. The map means you can put it into Halo CE. Leave it there for now (cold snap is also a suitable map)

, Locate and click the 'open file location' button. This should open another screen that has folders, triggers, and basically everything else in Halo 1. Find the folder that's called: 'Maps'. Open it. You should see a list of all the maps like 'Death Island', 'Ice Land', etc.
 (It really doesn't matter where so long as its in the Maps folder.) Once the map file has been transferred, things should start to disappear off of your screen. A good thing. Now click "Apply" followed by "OK" on the 'Properties' screen of Halo CE

,, Then click 'Create Game'

,,, You should be in a huge-*** hangar. Look around for a Pelican Drop ship .
, Otherwise it is regular 'W' and mouse moving for movement.
