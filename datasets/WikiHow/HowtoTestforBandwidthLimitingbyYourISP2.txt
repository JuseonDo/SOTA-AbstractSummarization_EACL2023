 This organization is focused on promoting net-neutrality and offers a bandwidth tester for sophisticated internet users.
 This will test the integrity of data sent over your network to see if your ISP is limiting your bandwidth. For example:


If you want to test whether BitTorrent downloads are working correctly, you can go to that page and find some torrents that others are seeding from test machines.
If you want to test if your ISP is interfering with BitTorrent seeding, you can post a link to a torrent file on the wiki and seed that torrent while running a Switzerland client so that other people can find it on the wiki and try to download it while running a Switzerland client.
 This is indicated in bold letters.
 You can choose between either .zip or .tgz.
 You can find the instructions within the INSTALL.txt file specific to your platform.
