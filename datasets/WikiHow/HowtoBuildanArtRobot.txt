 Most of these supplies such as the motor and battery holder can be found at mostly any local Hobby Shops, or you can order them online. The batteries could be found at any Pharmacy or Walgreens. Everything else could be found at a craft store.;
, Before the glue dries, put the cork or Styrofoam ball onto the glue. Then, using the glue gun, attach one end of a Popsicle stick to the top of the cork or Styrofoam ball.
 The base of the cup is the top of the cup. Using any of the tape and/or glue, attach the motor to the base of the body, (top of plastic cup).
 Make sure that the switch on the battery pack is OFF. Using electrical tape, attach the battery pack with the batteries on to the side of the Art Bot's body, (plastic cup).



Note: if you do not have a battery pack with an ON/OFF switch, don't connect both pairs of wires. Just connect one pair, or the motor will start spinning, and you aren't ready yet.
