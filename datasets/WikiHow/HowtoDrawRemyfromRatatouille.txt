 Begin by drawing a circle, then a bigger circle a bit to the right below it. Connect the two with a couple lines (as shown).



 ;
, Add a large oval, tilted slightly to the right, upon the smaller circles. Inside the oval, about halfway into it, draw a half circle or a rounded edged, half triangle.
 These are Remy's ears. One should be tilted up and the other tilted downward. The cones should have the tops removed and the bottom facing up.
 Above the half circle, draw two smaller, upper half circles. Left one bigger than the right. Within them, draw a small circle. Within the big half circle, draw a circle near the bottom right edge of it. Lastly, below it, draw another half circle, but a bit more elongated, then a small rectangle within it, with a small line at the halfway point.
 Angled inward, draw two smaller rectangles attached at the bottom of the others. These are the arms. At the end of the arms, draw two small diamond shapes pointed inward. Add fingers by drawing three to four vertical lines within the diamond.
 Create the legs by drawing two large ovals on top of the large circle base. Below those, draw a set of three small circles for the paws. Behind the right oval, draw a wavy tail.
 For some nice detail, draw three whiskers on both sides of his nose.
 It doesn't matter what you use (ink or paint, for example). After a few minutes, erase your pencil marks to make everything nice and neat. Add some jagged edges to the outline to show fur.
 Use some different shades, and textures to make his fur look furry like.
