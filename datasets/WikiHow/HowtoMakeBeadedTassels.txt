@article
 Allow roughly 3 times the amount of length that you need for the finished product, as this allows room for not only the head of the tassel but also length of the trailers.;
, Many designs call for a minimum of 9, but use whatever number will work well in your application

, Tie a knot at 1 end of the upholstery thread.
 The starter bead is normally a larger bead in the design that serves as the stopper for the rest of the beads in the strand.
 Make the design as eclectic or as simple as you like. Beads can vary in size and shape, depending on the look you wish to achieve.
 Cut off the knot at the end of the upholstery thread, and attach 1 end of the trailer. Gently pull the trailer through the beads until the top of the trailer emerges from the last bead in the series. Make sure the trailer is taut, with no extra length along the strand. Promptly tie 1 end of the trailer to keep the beads in position.
, Knot the individual trailers together, positioning the knot as close to the beads as possible, but far away enough that the trailers can hang freely. Loop the trailer, and tie in place to create a means of hanging the tassel.
 This helps to hide the knot and give the tassel a finished look. If desired, use a small drop of hot glue to hold the bead in position.
