 If you'll notice on the show, Topanga always wore soft colors like that. She usually wears a 3-piece outfit - 1) A top that slightly exposes her large breasts, but not in a skanky way 2) A jacket or button-down over the top 3) Cute hip-hugging skirts or jeans.;
, You're aiming for girl-next-door with a little wild in her. Do nice things for people.
 Lip gloss, Mascara, and maybe a little blush is all you need.
, Topanga is an excellent student. On the show, Topanga always strived for the best grades, and when she didn't get the best grades, she would always talk to (or yell at) Mr. Feeny about it. Aim for straight A's in school.
 Part of what made Topanga so sexy and admirable (apart from her looks) was how courageous, assertive, and daring she was. She was a very sweet person, but she took no garbage from anyone. Be nice to people, but at the same time, show that you have a backbone and that you are not afraid to tell people like it is. Find a balance between honest, sincere, and straightforward. Also, try your best at every task and never do anything halfway. Topanga was a bit of a perfectionist.
