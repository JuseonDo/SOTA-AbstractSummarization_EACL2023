 You do not want the water to be able to enter the smaller pot at all. If you are using a coffee pot or tin bowl, be sure to keep the water level from reaching the top., When the water has boiled, lower the temperature to maintain a constant source of even heat. It is best to avoid placing the second pot into the boiling water to prevent water from splashing into it., Smaller sections will make it easier to quickly melt the soap at an even pace. Try to keep track of how much soap you are cutting. Is it 1 pound, 2 pounds? This will make a difference when it comes time to add the oil., Use a little caution if you are using a coffee pot or tin bowl to prevent causing a burn to yourself. If you are using a double boiler this should present no problems for you.,, Stir it up a little if necessary. Stirring will help distribute the heat evenly. This can take a bit of time, often up to an hour., Add oil sparingly. Better to have a mildly scented soap than to create a soap that will be overbearingly scented., Keep the shiny surface of the wrap up to assist with easier removal. Be sure to cover all areas. Overlap the paper if necessary to avoid any bare spots. Omit this step if you purchased soap molds., It could take up to 24 hours to completely set., Prepare to cut the soap into bars by marking off sizable sections. A sharp knife can be used. The best approach to getting even bar cuts is to use a ruler and utility knife., Press down gently but firmly until you have completely sliced through each section. Take your time and be patient if you wish to obtain a clean cut., You can try to duplicate a store wrapper or create your own wrapping design. If you really want to get fancy you could embellish each wrapper with a decorative design., The cover will help maintain the aroma of the soap.
