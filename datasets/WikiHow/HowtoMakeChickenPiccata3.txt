 The milk will give the flour a liquid to bind to, which leads to a thicker "skin" on the cooked chicken. If you do this, premix the salt and pepper in with the flour to ensure it stays on the chicken when you dredge it. The rest of the recipe proceeds like normal.
 This will give a rich creaminess to the dish that the original lacks. It goes without saying that this variation is substantially heavier and less healthy than the original, but it tastes incredible.
 Capers are traditional in chicken piccata, but they're not for everyone. They can be easily ignored, especially if you use heavy cream (as mentioned above) to give the sauce a little more thickness and body., These small roots are known as aromatics. Shallots, when cooked, have a wonderful savory-sweetness, while garlic is welcome in almost all Italian dishes if you want it. Simply mince the garlic and shallots and add to the hot oil as the chicken comes out. Cook for 30-60 seconds, then proceed with the wine and/or lemon broth.,
