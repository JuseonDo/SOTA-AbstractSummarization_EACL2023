 You don't have to play with it for long; maybe if you just look after it for about 15 minutes. That way you are still making the effort.

, Buying Milk, fish, fruit, veg and yogurts always make a Babydow baby happy. Keep it healthy, you will also see stars below the food item. If it has a lot of stars by the product, it means it is good to use.
 You should send the baby to an expensive school or a good nursery.
 Making friends on Babydow is great because you can add them and then when the other person comes online, your baby and also their baby can play together.
 Keep it as cute as possible.
 Bathe it daily and change its nappy.
 They really love cuddles.
 Even if you just have one, it's OK, but use it on the right stuff.
 It keeps them healthy.

, Feed when they wake up, feed again in the afternoon and a snack before going to bed.
