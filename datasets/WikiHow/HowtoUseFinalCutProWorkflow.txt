Option 1: If Final Cut is on your dock, move your mouse (cursor) to your dock, locate Final Cut, and then click it.
Option 2: Go to your Hard Drive click applications. Next go to the Final Cut Pro application.
Option 3: Hold the command key and press the space bar once; then type "Final Cut Pro". You should then see the Final Cut Pro application. Proceed to click the Icon.;
, Just click continue. If you had your camera/deck plugged in and turned on you may need to do some troubleshooting.
, Click that text, and a drop-down menu will open; now locate and highlight "System Settings". After you have done this, a window will pop up. You should see two columns with one button in each (Clear, and Set). Click Set and locate where you would like Final Cut Pro to save your render files.
, Then plug it in. (Normal Port is a FireWire 400 or 800 slot.)

,, After that, make sure that your camera is playing the video you recorded, and you should see it on the screen playing more slowly. It's okay. It's just capturing all the frames; it will always look a little choppier on a computer because computers and TVs don't have the same refresh rate.
