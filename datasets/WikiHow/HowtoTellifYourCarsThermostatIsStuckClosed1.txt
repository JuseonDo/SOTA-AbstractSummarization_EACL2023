 A stuck thermostat might be to blame if your gauge marker nears the red danger zone within five to 15 minutes.;
, Unhook your coolant reservoir if you can undo it and pour the antifreeze into a container. Locate your radiator and remove the cap.



You might not need to drain the radiator, depending on the amount your reservoir holds. The amount drained is roughly 1 to 2 qt. (4 to 8 cups). You can reuse this coolant if it is brand new. Otherwise, replace it with new coolant.
 The thermostat housing is usually under the upper radiator hose. Unbolt the housing and remove the thermostat, using a screwdriver and pliers. Take the thermostat inside. There will generally be a number somewhere on the body, giving it's opening temperature usually between 160 to 190°F or 70 to 90°C. Otherwise you will need to check the Workshop Manual for the car.
 Ensure that the part does not touch the bottom of the pan.
 Check the temperature frequently while monitoring the thermostat.


The thermostat should remain closed until it just about reaches the thermostat-opening temperature designated on the body (or in the Workshop Manual). At this temperature, you should see the thermostat begin to open.
The part should be completely open when the water reaches approximately 10 degrees above the reading on the thermostat. If the thermostat is still closed at this point, it needs to replaced.
