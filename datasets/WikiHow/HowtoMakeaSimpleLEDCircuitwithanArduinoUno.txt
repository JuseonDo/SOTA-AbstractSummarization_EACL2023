@summary
set up the arduino software on your computer.

@summary
place the desired number of leds on the breadboard in series with the resistors.the resistor must reach across the "dip support" section of the breadboard.

@summary
connect the digital output pins from the arduino to the positive side of the leds.

@summary
connect the ground from the arduino to the breadboard.

@summary
write a program to turn the leds on.

@summary
download the program to your arduino uno.

@summary
test your outputs.

 If you haven't done this already, an excellent walk through on how to set it up for the first time can be found in How to Write Arduino Software in C.;
,
Start with a 2.2k resistor or higher and work your way down in resistance to desired brightness once you are able to successfully run the program.



This will be the lead with the longer stem.
 Connect a jumper from the negative leads of each LED to the ground. This will be the lead with the shorter stem.


The ground runs the entire length of the board, and is sometimes called the "power rail".


A sample program to use pins 2 through 9 can be found here: https://pastebin.com/TSdTXA7e






int time = 500;
int inittime = 50;
 
void setup()                        // initial setup
{
  for(int i=9; i>=2; i--)           // Loops from i=9 down to and including i=2
  {
  pinMode(i, OUTPUT);               // sets pin i the digital pin as output
  delay(inittime);                  // waits for inittime
  }
}
 
void loop()
{
 
  for(int i=2; i<10; i++)           // Loops from i=2 up to but not including i=10
  {
  digitalWrite(i, LOW);             // sets the LED on
  delay(time);                      // waits for time
  digitalWrite(i, HIGH);            // sets the LED off
  delay(time);                      // waits for time
  }
}
