 This will give you administrator rights, which will make the installation smoother. Note that, once installed, the program doesn’t need to be run as an administrator.;
, Be sure to download a version that includes a Windows Installer. Save the file on your Windows Desktop.


If you’re not sure which version to select, download MySQL Installer for Windows.
 The installation file comes as a .zip file, so double-clicking it should initiate your unzipping software and take you to an archive folder.
 (It should be the only file inside your archive.) This will initialize the setup process.
 This begins the setup.
 This will enable you to specify where you want to install MySQL. If you have Apache installed in C:\Server, you will want to install MySQL in the same directory.


In the next window, highlight MySQL Server, and then click the Change.
In the next window, in the text box Folder Name, change the directory to C:\Server\MySQL\ exactly as it’s written here and then click OK.
On the next window, click Next. Now MySQL is ready to install.
 Wait while the program self-installs.
 Once the installation is complete, you will be presented with a MySQL Sign-Up window. Skip signing up with MySQL for now since you can sign up later if you like. Once you’ve skipped, your new dialogue box should say Wizard Completed.
 Leave the check box Configure the MySQL Server Now checked and click Finish.
 This will initialize the configuration setup.
 This is the default configuration and is recommended for most users.
, Type in what you want your root password to be and make sure Enable root access from remote machines is checked. Make sure you choose a difficult to guess password and 'write it down so you don't forget it. Click Next.
 This will start the MySQL server. After MySQL has done its thing, click Finish.
 This will open a command window asking you for a password.
 This should initiate the program.
