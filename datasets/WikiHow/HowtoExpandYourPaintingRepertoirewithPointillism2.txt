 Gather your watercolors and other supplies. Use a set containing dry pads or watercolors in tubes in primary colors and black. Also, prepare a work space, large container of water, and tissues., Trim the bristles of a cheap easel painting brush to Â½ inch long. First tape around the bristles to secure them and cut through with ordinary scissors. Remove tape., This can be a flower, animal, bird, fish, or plan to do an abstract design., Keep it simple., Touch the brush to an area of paint and on practice paper. When you stamp the brush aim for getting individual dots of color. Practice until you achieve this dotted effect.
 One method is to do the dark areas first., Enjoy the process of painting with tiny dots.

Another way is to under paint an area with a watercolor wash. Use a normal watercolor brush for this. Allow it to dry and then use your special stippling brush to paint dots over the colored area.
 See whether the colors merge from a distance. You might consider going back in and reworking an area with larger dots. Do this by using a small, pointed brush and painting each dot individually.
