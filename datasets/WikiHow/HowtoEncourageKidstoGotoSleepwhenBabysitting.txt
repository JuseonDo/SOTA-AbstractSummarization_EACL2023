 If you are mean to them, obviously they're not going to want to listen to you. From their eyes, you're the bad guy. If you stay on their good side by being nice to them, they're more likely to listen to you.;
, Sometimes kids have a hard time figuring out if you're serious or just fooling around. Make sure they understand that when you say 'Bed time,' you mean business.
 Run around, do jumping jacks, go outside, anything. If they're tired, they'll go to sleep.
 Okay, maybe we know they're not magical, but the kids don't. Try mixing apple juice and orange juice, calling it, 'sleepy medicine', and all of a sudden, the kids are very tired. You don't even have to stick with 'potions', other foods work too.
 The best warm milk recipe calls for one cup of milk, a dusting of cinnamon sugar, and some vanilla flavoring. It's a zesty and delicious treat!

, This creates a relaxing environment that calms them down and gets them ready for sleep.
 It's my secret potion! So you have to promise NEVER to tell anyone!" Goodnight!

, If the child is scared, they're not going to go to sleep. A simple nightlight will fix the problem in a jiffy.
