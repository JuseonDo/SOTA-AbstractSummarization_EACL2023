, Water the roses in the morning so they will be dry by nightfall. If the leaves are wet when temperatures cool at night, the roses could develop a fungal disease.


You want to use a strong spray and direct the water at the top of the leaves, the bottom of the leaves, and along the stems. Most aphids do not have wings and will be unable to get back on the rose shrubs once the water rinses them off.
The strong spray of water will also crush the aphids.
 Water the roses consistently in the morning to ward off the aphids.
