You will be provided with numerical data as well as a pie chart of your memory usage. The number shown as total RAM should be between 256MB and 64GB. This number could be more or less depending on the power of your system. Ideally you should be using less than half of your total amount of RAM. If you have 512MB of total RAM, utilizing 256MB or less enables optimal system operability.;
