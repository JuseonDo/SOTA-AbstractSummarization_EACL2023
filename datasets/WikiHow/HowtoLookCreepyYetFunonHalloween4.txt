 Try for (if you have black or dark brown hair) white or pale hair extensions, maybe electric blue. Electric blue and black could work for blonds, reds and light browns.
 Use toner, moisturizer, shower every day all year to achieve magic-looking skin.
 The bodice should be skinny and old-looking, the skirt a little frilly and lacy. Team this with opaque black tights. Choose black pumps or very small heels for this look, or even black Converse to have a bit of fun with it. And black, lacy wings are awesome.
 Smudge the eyeliner if you want, which could look cool if you want to be a cool Goth fairy.
 Can you imagine an evil Halloween fairy smiling? Of course, smile if you want, and flit around because you are a fairy. Walk with your head in the clouds,and tell the most amazing dark fairy stories when it's time for horror stories.
