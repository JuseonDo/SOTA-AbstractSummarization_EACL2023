 A sticker will wear over time, peeling back and leaving sticky residue. But, if you want a low cost color change, this is the best way to do it.;
, There are dozens, if not hundreds, of companies who provide sticker decals for your iPhone.
 Skins can range from $5 to $50, depending upon the look and the quality.
 Use a computer-safe spray and/or microfiber cloth. A clean surface will provide better adhesion.
 Placing it on the right area the first time is the best way to ensure it will stay put for a long time.
 Ask someone to do it for you, if you do not believe you can apply it well.
