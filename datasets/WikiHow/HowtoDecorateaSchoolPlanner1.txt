 You will need a couple of sheets of paper, a scissors, a glue stick and some colored pencils, pens or markers.;
, You can cut it down to a smaller size first, or allow it to cover the entire front of your planner. Use a generous amount of glue to stick it in place, otherwise it will come loose.
 Write ______'s School Planner, Year __ in bright colors on the sheet of paper you just stuck to the planner. This will be helpful in case you lose it.
 Around your name, doodle anything that appeals to you, i.e stars, smiley faces, cartoon characters, footballs, books, hearts, animals, etc. If you like, you can stick some stickers in the empty spaces.
 With your other sheet of paper, do the same, but on the back.
 On the first sheet of paper inside, write the date and stick down a sticker. Draw inside, for example, a picture of your school, you, your best friend, your teacher or headmaster.
 Continue doing so on each page, but actually write down the important things, like your timetable, what homework you've got and any clubs you're going to!
