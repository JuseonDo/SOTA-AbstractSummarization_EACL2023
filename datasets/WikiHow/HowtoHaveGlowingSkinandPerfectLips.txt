 Make sure your cleanser is suited to your skin type.;
, Do not rub as it could lead to irritation. Even better, leave your skin to dry naturally.
 Make sure that it is not alcohol based as alcohol is drying. Do not dry your face after toning as the dampness helps your skin to soak in the moisture from your moisturizer.
 Again, make sure it is suited to your skin type and is not alcohol based. Do this step and the ones above every day.
 Make sure that you do the patch test before using. Facemasks are super-moisturising and help to wipe away any minor impurities.
 Instead apply some Sudocrem to it. This helps to dry the pimple out and it is available in most pharmacies. It also works as a good base for makeup.
, Lush do nice ones. Apply a good lipbalm (like Carmex or Vaseline) before and after you go outside, before you go to bed and as soon as you wake up.
