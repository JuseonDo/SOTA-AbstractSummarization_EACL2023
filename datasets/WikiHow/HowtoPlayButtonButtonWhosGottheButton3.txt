 For a surprising approach, have them wait in another room., Make sure the button can easily be found, even by the smallest child, and not in a well-hiding place., Use proximity phrases such as, "Timmy is hot" (the child is close to the button hiding spot) or "Susie is very cold!" (the child is very far away from the button)., The child whom finds the button is the winner, and the next person to hide it for the next round.
