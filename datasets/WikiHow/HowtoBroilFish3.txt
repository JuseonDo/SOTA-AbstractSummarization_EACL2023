 You should pull the rack out enough so that you can easily place the fish on the pan but not so much that you remove the rack.
 You may want to curl up the edges of the foil so that any juices don’t pour out onto the cooking pan and burn; this will also save you cleanup time.
, Expect to cook the fish for about 5 to 7 minutes for every inch of thickness. However, check the fish often to prevent burning.
 Let it sit and rest for about a minute before loosening it from the foil.
 You’ll need to use the widest spatula that you own to ensure that the fish does not fall apart when you remove it from the pan. If you used fish with the skin on one side, you may find that you can separate the flesh from the skin easily with the spatula at this point.
