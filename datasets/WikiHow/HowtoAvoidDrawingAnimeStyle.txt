@summary
realize that it might simply be that the person judging your work thinks everything is anime.

@summary
look for the tell-tale signs that your work is anime: big eyes, small nose, shiny or large hair.

@summary
if your characters have large eyes, keep them.

@summary
go people-watching.

@summary
instead of drawing a generic anime face shape, think of the shape of the face you want.

@summary
get rid of that teeny-tiny nose.

@summary
take note of the clothing.

 If so, try telling the person that what you draw isn't always anime, then show them an anime drawing and a non-anime drawing and point out the differences.;
, Is your work any of these things?

, They're expressive, which is useful in all cartoons.
 Just watch people reacting with their natural habitat. Make notes of how their face is shaped and how their hair has grown. Draw quick sketches if it helps.
 The person you looked at had a square chin? Draw that. Were they ageing and wrinkly? Draw that. If you are drawing a cartoon then make it less lifelike.
 You can take two paths: (in my opinion)look at your subjects nose and just draw it simplified or just get rid of the nose all together. Some cartoonists draw eyes without pupils, some have no ears!

, If you just want cartoon-like clothes, try to stop drawing so many creases and folds. If you want realism, add more.
