 Keep track of when they go to sleep so if they go late then just do other things in the meantime.;
, Also try walking on your tip toes or heels.
 Obviously, make sure no one heard it. It would be cool if you could have tv connected to a pair of headphones.
 Or none at all. It will wake the family up and then you will get caught.
 Try to stay awake some nights before to see what time your parents tend to awake from their slumber.
