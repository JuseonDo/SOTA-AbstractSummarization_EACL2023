 Exactly what it takes varies from field to field, but most require a combination of formal education and applied experience.


Some industries and subjects have professional certifications and licenses, such as an insurance license or Six Sigma certification. Check industry publications and trade associations for the certifications appropriate for your area of expertise. When it comes to being recognized as an expert, the more letters you can put after your name, the better off you are.;
, This will keep you in the know on industry trends, give you access to other experts, and let you know about opportunities to show off your knowledge.
 Submit it for free to your local newspaper or other community publications. These publications are often in need of filler material, meaning they'll be willing to accept work from an unpublished writer.
 You can do this at local community colleges, universities, large employers, conventions and events.
 These articles should be on different angles of your subject so no magazine feels like you've simply recycled material.
 These are services that journalists subscribe to that put them in touch with experts for a quick quote when their articles call for it.

 If you lack the time or writing skills to do this, you can hire a writer to blog for you.
 Public speaking, professional articles, ebooks and print books are all good ways to show off what you know.
