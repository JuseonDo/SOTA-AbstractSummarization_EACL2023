@summary
be up front and talk to them.

@summary
don't feel guilty if the person admits to being sad about not going.

@summary
make up for leaving them out if the person you are leaving out is often shunned by your set of friends.
@article
 That's the best way to know what's going on! Not all people are even sad because they aren't invited, and this person might think the people in your group are pretty lame anyway.;
, Explain why you weren't able to invite that person (you should probably prepare all this ahead of time). Whatever your reason, always say a heartfelt sorry.
 If the person is either a person you wouldn't dream of hanging out with or a close friend, try to hang out with them a little more from now on. The person might think you don't want to be friends, so prove this wrong. It would really help if you starting bringing them along to your house, the movies, a party, etc. You don't have to hang with them ALL the time. Just more than you usually did.
