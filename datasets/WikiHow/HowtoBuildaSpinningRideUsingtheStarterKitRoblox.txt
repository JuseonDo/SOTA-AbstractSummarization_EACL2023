,, First Click and Drag the Blue brick with the Hinge (Yellow Thing) in the middle of it; Place it where ever you want. This is your starting piece.
 Drag the rectangle brick and put it on top of the first Blue brick you placed.
 These will be called the Arms. The Arms will be the pieces that support the seats.
Do the same thing with the other skinny rectangle brick, but this time on the other side of the previous one. It Should look like this.
 Drag this piece and palace it UNDER one of the "Arm" bricks that you connected in the last step. Like so...
And again to the other side. Right under the other "Arm".
 This is going to be the Chair. A Robloxian Character needs somewhere to sit when on the ride.
Once again, repeat the last step to the other side, under the Skinny Blue rectangle brick you placed.
 Locate and Drag the Small and Blue, Skinny, Rectangle brick and place it under the White Square brick you connected in the previous step.
Do the same to the other side with the other brick just like the one you just connected in this step.

Do this to the other side as well. Use CTRL+C and CTRL+V to make another copy of the brick if there is not already a second one to use.
 For this step, Click the remaining skinny white brick (The Seat) > CTRL+C > Then CTRL+V to make a copy of this brick. Now, place this brick on top of the Blue Square Brick you placed in the last step (This is where you sit to ride the ride!)
Repeat. Do the same with the other similar brick (The one that you Copied and Pasted) and place it on the other seat.

Then, Press and Hold CTRL+G to group it all together!
