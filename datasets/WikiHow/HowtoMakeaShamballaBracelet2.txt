 Think of each cord as cord 1 (left), 2 (middle) and 3 (right) when you're working with them in this section.









Pick up cord 1.
Place cord 1 over the top of cords 2 and 3.
, Put it under, then through the loop made between cords 1 and 2.
 Cord 2 should be held tight as you're making the knot. Pull the knot tight. You have half a square knot in place.










Pick up cord 1 and place it under cords 2 and 3.
Place cord 3 under cord 1.
Place the end of cord 3 over and through the loop made between cords 1 and 2.
 The idea is to make a line of square knots until it's time to add the first bead in place. A good guide is to make 4 to 6 knots before adding the first bead.
 Push the bead right up against the last square knot you made.
 The purpose of this is to trap the bead within the square knot.
 You can vary how many knots between each bead but it's a good idea to keep it to 1 or 2 knots between each bead (as is common with store-sold ones). Keep the gaps between beads and the lengths at either end symmetrical for a better end result.









Add in each bead as before, trapping each bead within a square knot.
Add about five to six beads, depending on your wrist size or the desired size of the bracelet. (Note that the size of the beads may impact how many you add too––adjust accordingly.)

, Make the exact same amount of square knots as at the start.
