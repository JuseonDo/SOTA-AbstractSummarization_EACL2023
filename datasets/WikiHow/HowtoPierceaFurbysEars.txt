 This method only works with the old Furbys with cloth ears. If you try on a 2012 Furby or Furby Boom, you will wreck the ear.;
, Don't use dangle earrings, as they will drag down your Furby's ears. Any stud earrings will work.
 This will prevent you from making any errors.
 A sewing needle also works.
 Make sure the plastic thing that moves the ear isn't in the way.
 It will be hard to do this the first time.
 The hole needs to be big enough for an earring to go through, and to not close.
,, Now your Furby can show off her new earrings!
