 Fleece comes in a variety of thicknesses and patterns.


Polar fleece comes in a number of thicknesses, including micro, 100, 200 and 300. The thicker the fleece is, the less flexible it will be.;
,, Match up the curled edges as closely as possible.
, Scarf length preference varies from person to person, so the width is your decision.


8 or 9 inches (21 to 23 cm) is a standard width for a scarf. 60 inches (152.4 cm) is a standard length for a scarf. 40 inches (102 cm) long would work better for a child.
 Mark the measurement with a pencil.
,,


Cut your fabric on a self-healing mat, if possible. A self-healing mat is a common craft supply, made of a foam-like polymer that restores itself after it has been cut. It protects home surfaces from fabric knife or blade cutting.
 Use a straight edge to ensure you cut evenly.
 While most fleece scarves are made with a fringe, it is a decorative choice. You can omit this step in the process.


Measure 5 inches (12.7 cm) from the edge of the bottom of the length of the scarf. Mark it with a pencil. You want your fringe of your scarf to be 5 inches (12.7 cm) long.
Measure and cut the 5 inch (12.7 cm) strips every 1/2 inch (1.3 cm). This will complete the fringe and your no-sew fleece scarf.
