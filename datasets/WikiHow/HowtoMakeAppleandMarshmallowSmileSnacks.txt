 Use an apple slicer that can both core the apple and make even slices at the same time.


If you don't have such a slicer, simply cut the apple into even slices, using all of the apple.;
,, Place a row of small marshmallows along the slice.
,, If serving for Halloween, a party or other entertainment occasion, these look great arranged together on a single serving platter. You might like to provide serving tongs.
