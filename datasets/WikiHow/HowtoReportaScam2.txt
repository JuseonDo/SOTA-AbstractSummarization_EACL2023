 If you discover a business scam, contact the BBB in the city and state the business is located in. If you do not know the precise location, go to the BBB website and fill out the "Report a Scam" form there, filling out as much contact information as possible.


The BBB's primary use is to protect consumers against bad businesses. By reporting a business scam to the BBB, you prompt them to investigate the business. If that business's practices prove fraudulent, the BBB will report them as such, warning other consumers not to get involved.
 Contacting all of these organizations will help you regain whatever you lost from the scam and can also help prevent others from being targeted by the same group of scammers.
 If you discover that someone has been cheating on their taxes, especially through the use of off-shore schemes or trusts, report those violators to the Lead Development Center of the IRS. You should especially report promoters of such scams to the IRS. You can contact the Lead Development Center by fax at 877-477-9135., Scams concerning the illegal sale of prescription medication or false medical treatments should be reported to the FDA. If you receive these scams via email or are harassed by them online, send an email with as much information as possible to webcomplaints@ora.fda.gov.
 If you are a victim of mail fraud or someone attempts to scam you using the mail system, the United States Postal Service should be notified. It cannot resolve standard disputes between customers and legitimate companies, but it can and will act if the company's activity suggests fraudulent activity., If you lost money or personal information due to a scam, it is important to file a report with local, county, or state law enforcement officials. The Federal Trade Commission should also be notified of any and all major scams that attempt to falsely steal money from you.
