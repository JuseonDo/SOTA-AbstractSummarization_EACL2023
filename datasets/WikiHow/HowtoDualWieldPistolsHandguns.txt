 This technique can be used with revolvers or pistols. The pistols should ideally be the same, or at least similar in size, weight and firing ability.;
,, Make sure you are equally good at shooting accurately with both your left and right hand.
, No matter what you've seen in John Woo movies, the human eye can't accurately aim two pistols at once, so use point shooting. This will lower your accuracy, but the alternative is painfully slow shooting.
 If you fire both pistols in different directions, check in advance that there's nothing that would be dangerous or irresponsible to shoot in the direction you aren't looking. And naturally, shooting in a direction without looking will be very bad for that hand's accuracy.
