 Cream, tan and light blue can add a beachy brightness to any room. Dark furniture, such as black, dark grey and brown leather will draw the eye away from your light walls and d√©cor.
 Use the parallel walls for mirrors, light-colored upholstered furniture and wallpaper. This will promote daylight to flow into the room.
