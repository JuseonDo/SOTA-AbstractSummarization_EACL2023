 You're the host, and losing control of yourself means losing control of the party. You won't be able to monitor what's going on in your house if you have too much to drink, and you don't want to force your friends to take on your responsibilities.
 Nothing too heavy or too slow!

, Keep yourself moving and talk to every one. If someone arrives that you don't know (friend of a friend, for example) try to get to know them a little better and if they are making a mess ask them to leave.
 If you get angry, or start chasing around after people with a broom, people will get sick of you. You can tidy up later!

, These games can be a lot of fun.
 Try to politely get rid of them, nothing more interesting is going to happen
