Cut two pieces of fabric to make your bag--front fabric 22" x 13" and lining fabric 22" x 12.5."






Cut one piece from the other fabric piece for your binding--22" x 3.5."






Create the bag handle from the same material you used for the bag (or you could purchase another style/pattern) that is 22" x 2.5."
