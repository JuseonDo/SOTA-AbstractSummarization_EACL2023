 You can add a degree symbol using your iOS device's keyboard, but you'll need to switch to the correct view first.
 This can be found in the lower-left corner, and will switch the keyboard to show numbers and some symbols.
 You'll see a menu pop-up with the degree symbol.
 This will insert the degree symbol into the text that you're writing.
