,, It's all right if your opponent sees where your ships are, or if you see his!

, Where you mark it will determine where it will show up on your opponent's side: the higher you mark the dot on your side the lower it will show up on your opponent's side, and the lower you mark the dot on your side the higher it will show up on your opponent's side.
, If not, hold it up to the light. Mark a dot in the exact same place as you did in step 4. Then fold the paper back over.



See how the dot shows up on your opponent's side. It's up to you how many hits each ship can take. Normally, it's only one hit for any ship.







Watch to see if you manage to sink a ship, and then write the word sunk on it so that you and your opponent will know there is no need to fire at it anymore.
 Whoever sinks all of the other person's ships first wins!
