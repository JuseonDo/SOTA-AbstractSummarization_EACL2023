 If you have a helmet, wear it. If not, borrow one to wear! It also helps to have knee pads and elbow pads.
 Soft ground is probably the best to look for in case you fall over.,, You should notice that the back wheel will jump off the ground. Do this step a couple of times to get the feel for it., Now that you are used to the movement of the bicycle, try pulling down the front brake. At the same time, push your body and lean forwards towards the handlebar. Release the brake and pedal when the rear wheel gets to the floor and try the trick.,
