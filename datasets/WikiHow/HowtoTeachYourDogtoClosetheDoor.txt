use a clicker rather than only treats.

@summary
use a little piece of paper and hold it in one hand.

@summary
do this exercise again and again.

@summary
now your dog is ready.

@summary
good job!,

@summary
continue:

@summary
opening the door a little wider each time

@summary
making the distance between you (and your dog) and the door a little bigger each time

@summary
making the piece of paper a little smaller each time (cut it in half..)

@summary

@summary
continue until:

@summary
your dog knows that he's supposed to really close the door, not just touch it

@summary
your dog knows exactly what you are talking about when you say "door" even if the door is far a way or not visible from is location

@summary
your dog closes the door without a piece of paper.

 If you don't know what a clicker is or how it works do some research and think about purchasing a clicker, or just use a "clicker word", a word that you use every single time your dog does what he's supposed to do, before you give him a treat.;
, Get your dog to touch the paper (get him to touch it, don't make him touch it). As soon as he touches the paper with his nose (or paw) click or say a clicker word and then throw a treat on the floor for him right away. Don't feed the treat from your hand, otherwise your dog will get more interested in the delicious smelling hand than in the piece of paper.
 If your dog gets what you want him to do make him touch the paper a little more every time he does it. If he's already good at that wait until he uses his paw to touch it. If he does that be very happy and show him that he did a great job. So you basically want him to get used to touch the little piece of paper with his paw every time you want him to.
 If you used a post-it as a piece of paper, stick it on the door, a little below the height of your dog's nose. Have him touch the piece of paper with his paw again. You should be pretty close to the door yourself. Now you can start using the command "door" or whatever word you'd like to use. Say it while you're pointing at the paper. Don't forget to click or say a clicker word as soon as he touches it.
 This is the time when you should open your door a little and have your dog push it a little while touching the paper with his paw. Same process as you did before: Your dog knows exactly that he has to touch the paper with his paw now (when you say door and point at it), so this time wait with the clicking until your dog actually pushes the door a little.
