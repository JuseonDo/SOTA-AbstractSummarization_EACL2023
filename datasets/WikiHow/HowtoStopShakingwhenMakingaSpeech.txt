 If you can, put some bullet points on an index card that will help you to remember your ideas.;
, Watch for things like eye contact, or nervous gestures like running a hand through your hair, or foot tapping.
 When you are focused on explaining a prop you will "forget" about the audience and be less nervous. But be careful, and don't talk into the object. Keep projecting your voice into the audience so that they can hear you.
 Knowing the territory, and testing out how loud you must be in order to be heard is an advantage.
 Instead of staring into many pairs of eyes, find something like a window with a view, preferably a calming one.
,, If they can give you a thumbs-up, or an encouraging smile, it can help unimaginably.
 Choreography will help take your mind off the audience. If you will move during the speech, check out anything that might make you trip.
 This will loosen you up. Vocal exercises that can help the voice are good, as well.
 If you already feel nervous, having a full-to-bursting stomach is not good.
 It will appear as if you're making eye contact. This way, you will not have to stare into critical eyes, if there are any.
