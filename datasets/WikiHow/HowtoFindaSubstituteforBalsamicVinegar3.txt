 Use a fork, the end of a rolling pin, or even the back of a spoon to do this. You want to break the skin and expose the flesh and juice.
 Make sure that the berries are completely covered.
 Keep the bowl in a cool place where it will not be disturbed. If it is warm in the room, move it to the fridge.
 Mash the berries against the sieve to get any excess juice and vinegar out. Once you are done, toss the berries.
 Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves.
 As soon as the vinegar starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Stir the mixture often with a spoon. If you don't, the sugar may scorch or caramelize.
 Use a funnel to help guide the mixture into the bottle. The bottle must be dark colored, or the vinegar will go bad.


Try getting a dark blue or green bottle.
 Use a cork or a plastic-topped cap. The vinegar may corrode other materials.
