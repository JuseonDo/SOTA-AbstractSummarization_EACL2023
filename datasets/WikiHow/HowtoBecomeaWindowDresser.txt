 Retail chains offer more stability, pay and benefits, but the work may be focused more on technical skills and the marketing aspect of retail merchandising than artistic vision.;
, Retail chains may look for more of a retail or management training and experience, for example, while freelance work in the area may focus more on visual and artistic work.
 This is a good way to learn about the retail environment and see what it's like to work in a store. Part time and seasonal jobs are fairly easy to get, even without experience. Students enrolled in a retail merchandising school can look for jobs as apprentices or interns that are offered either independently or through the school.
 There are many traditional and online certificate programs, associate degrees or bachelor's degrees offered. Courses in retail merchandising, graphic design and set design can help land a job and will provide access to career guidance and internships.
 This will generate publicity and add to your portfolio.
 Subscribe to magazines and online blogs.
 Inexpensive party decorations and seasonal items can be used over and over again to create store displays.
 Try to get local press to cover some of the window displays. Use a website and social networking tools like blogs and Twitter to show off your work.
 Get in the habit of visualizing displays and arrangements when looking at items. Check out popular store window displays, and read articles and blogs by window dressers and others in the field of visual merchandising.
