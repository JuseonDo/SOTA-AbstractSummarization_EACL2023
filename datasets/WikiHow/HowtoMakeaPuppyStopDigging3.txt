 A physical barrier can either prevent your puppy from digging in a particular area, or make it difficult enough that your puppy loses interest.You can either simply install garden fencing in sections of your yard that you do not want your puppy to enter (and possibly dig in), or you can construct a more dog-proof fencing system.


Motion-activated fencing lines that make a noise or spray water when something crosses them are another option for keeping your puppy out of a certain area. However, these may be costly, and may not prevent your puppy from digging in the ground around them.
 Fences can be constructed of various materials. To create a fencing system that is safe enough to not hurt your puppy while still discouraging its digging habit, however, you will need to gather specific materials from a hardware, garden, or home supply store:Chicken wire
Chain-link fence
Large rocks

, Start by burying chicken wire along the line of where where you want the fence to be.This will be the actual material to stop your puppy from digging in the ground; it is strong enough that your puppy can’t dig through it, but soft enough that your puppy won’t be hurt if it tries. Do make sure, however, to bend back the edges of the chicken wire.
 Bury the rocks partially in the dirt, so that you will know where the chicken wire is located.
 Installing the fence to this depth will ensure that your puppy cannot dig out easily.
 This layer of chicken wire will make it unattractive as a digging area to your puppy.
