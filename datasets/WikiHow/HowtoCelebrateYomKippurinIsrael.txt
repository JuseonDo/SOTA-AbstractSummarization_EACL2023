seeing as it is a high holiday, follow the same regulations as shabbat, which means no tv, cell phone and regular phone, computer, usage of electricity, etc.

@summary
during the actual day, you will be in the synagogue, going home for rests between the prayers.

@summary
once the last prayer is said and the fast is over, you are free to go home and revive yourself hoping that your year will be as sweet as honey.

 The day before the fast, you should be eating and drinking a lot in order to remain focused and feel well during the fast. A few hours before the fast begins, hold a meal with your family and enjoy each other's presence as you ready for yourself for the fast.;
, One of the many Halacha (Hebrew: "Jewish Laws") is that you do not wear leather shoes and most people wear white, though it isn't obligatory. The first prayers start during the evening, after the fast begins. Every year, the exact time which the fast begins and ends changes, so you need to check your Hebrew Calendar.
 Sometimes, Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat.
 If you have young children, it is wise to take turns as to who stays with them at home, since their presence would distract and annoy the other people in the synagogue. If your synagogue provides children's services, have your children attend them.
