 Be careful, because it has the move Perish Song, which can take you out in 3 moves.;
, Use a flying or fire move, and you can have a nice win against it.
 It usually uses Protect, and confuses you. Use an Electric-type, like Manectric, as Pelliper has a 4x weakness to it.
 Don't use Flying or Steel-type moves, or you're in trouble. Use a water move like Surf or Water Gun, or use fire moves. Skarmory is also weak to Electric-type moves.
 Dragon Dance, which raises attack and speed, which isn't good when it uses Aerial Ace. Don't use Ground-types, and you can win the battle.
