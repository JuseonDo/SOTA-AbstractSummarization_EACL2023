 To effectively clean smelly or dirty insoles, you will first need to remove the insoles from your shoes. Grip the back of the insole near the heel and gently pull the insole toward you until it is removed from the shoe.
 Gently scrub the insole with the brush until all visible debris is removed. Don’t scrub too hard as this can cause certain insole fabrics to pill., Apply a small amount of detergent to a cloth that has been immersed in warm water. Scrub the insole and briefly rinse in warm water before air drying., Once you’ve cleaned and rinsed the insoles, place them in an area away from heat, air vents, or direct sunlight to air dry. Once they are completely dry, you can return them to the shoes.
