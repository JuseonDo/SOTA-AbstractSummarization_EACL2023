 You must also be comfortable with your horse.;
, Never start off with the canter in the ring. That is just asking for trouble, and for your horse to be overworked.
 Be sure to always inspect the ground for holes, dips, etc. before you canter. Nothing worse than having your horse trip in a hole, and you falling off the horses neck.
 You should be leaning slightly forward and be moving with your horse. If your horse has an uncomfortable gait, it is ok to slightly lean back, almost as if sitting on your pockets (also think of the dressage canter;scoop forward with your pelvis). You'll know he's galloping by the distinct 4-beat thump, thump, thump, thump. He'll also be going very fast, but do not panic. If you panic, the horse will panic too.
, Do not try to go against your horse's motion, or you will fall off! When in doubt, relax, and let your body go with the motion of your horse.
