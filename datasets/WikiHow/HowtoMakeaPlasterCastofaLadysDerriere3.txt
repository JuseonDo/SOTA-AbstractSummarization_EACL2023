Use sandpaper to buff away any ragged edges or bumps.
You may want to file the top, bottom, and sides of the cast so they are even and represent the exact area of the body you wish to mold. So if you accidentally placed the bandages too high on your model's back, you can now file the plaster back down.
 This will create a barrier between the plaster cast and the liquid plaster, allowing you to remove your sculpture with ease., You'll have to estimate the amount it will take to fill the cast. Make sure you follow the directions on the package.Pour the powder plaster into the bucket and then add water, mixing vigorouslyScrape the bottom and sides of the bucket so that all the powder is incorporated into the water and you have no lumps., You want the freedom to tip it slightly so you can distribute the filling evenly, but you don't want it to tip over, either.Try placing it on the ground, hollow side up, and wrapping an old blanket around it for a little support.
 Pour slowly, as this will decrease the chance of air bubbles. Gently shake the cast and tap the bottom of the cast to release any air bubbles that may have formed., It will heat up significantly as it dries.
