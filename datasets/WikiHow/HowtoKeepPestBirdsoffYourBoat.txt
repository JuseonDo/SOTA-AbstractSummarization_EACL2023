 Birds prefer the high points on a vessel, but will also land on a protective canvas. Birds rely heavily on visual clues in their environment helping with flight, the detection of predators, food sources, etc, and moving, flapping objects will discourage birds from flying near or landing. Items called the Bird Spider, spikes, Scare Balloon, flash tape or a solar bird repeller. Simply placing a decoy of a bird-of-prey (such as an owl) on your vessel has been known to be an effective deterrent in keeping other birds away. If your vessel has a "Windex" style wind-direction indicator at the top of the mast, be sure to use the "bird spike" piece of hardware included to prevent birds perching on (and breaking) your Windex.;
,, The birds do not like the instability of landing on the wire, and so they move on to a more inviting perch.
