 It should be one that sits well and does not cause you to overbalance. You may wish to share the supplies around with others skiing with you; that way you can carry lighter loads all round.;
,, Place the soup in thermos flasks for a hot lunch; it is also possible to put sausages (meat or veggie) in thermos flasks for a hot meal. Lunch should also include some fruit (apples, oranges etc.) and some of the supplies from the high energy snacks.
 These can be nibbled on even while skiing but especially should be consumed when you stop for breaks every hour or so. Suggested ideal high energy snacks include:


Salted Crackers
Breakfast cereals, place in small Ziploc/sealing bags; add nuts if liked
Chocolate, especially dark chocolate and fruit/nut combinations
Nuts
Dried fruit
Energy bars
Hiking mixes

, You will need to keep up your liquid intake during the day. Put beverages in different thermos flasks; if possible, colour code (bottle/tape/decal etc.) to make it easy to know which beverage is in each thermos. Ideal beverages include:


Tea
Coffee
Hot chocolate
Water
Soup
