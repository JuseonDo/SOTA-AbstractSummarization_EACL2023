 Place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before using.;
, Pour it into the chilled bowl. Whisk on medium-high speed until you see it begin to thicken.
 If using sugar, add at this stage and whisk.
 The consistency of the cream is very important in determining when it can be used as frosting:


The cream should be whipped until it forms soft peaks.
When lifted with a spatula, the whipped cream should remain on the spatula without falling off.
If over-whipped, the cream will be too stiff to spread nicely. Stop when you see those peaks! That's when it's still wonderfully spreadable.
 Add it after the consistency has reached the stage explained in the previous step. Then blend in quickly by hand.
