if you are in the area of where pixar studios is located, you can always just drive past the building, even the outside is really neat and beautiful!

 This is mainly meant for younger people, where they have activities set up and stuff like that. When Pixar does hold charity events where they give tours, the tickets sell fast, so make sure you keep a close eye on when they will sell tickets. Keep in mind, that these tickets usually sell for a few hundred dollars, so you better keep saving up!;
, This is the most known way of getting a tour, by knowing somebody. Even if you don't have a close relative or friend that works there, you could still get a tour by knowing a guy, who knows a guy, who's neighbors with a guy, who's friends with a guy, and so on.
 This is where people that work there can invite a guest to come along and watch the movies. Please note, that if this is the way you'd get a tour, they also sometimes (if you're lucky) give tours if their co workers do bring a guest along with them.
 This isn't the most ideal way of getting in there, but it does work. You obviously have to be qualified to work there, and have taken a few years of school. If you are qualified enough, then Pixar will call you in to have an interview and then you will be able to see quite a bit of the building. Who knows, maybe you'll end up working there.
 They also sometimes give you a plane ride to where the studio is located if you win.
