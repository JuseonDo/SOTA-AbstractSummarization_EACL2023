 In order to do this, you need to do the motorcycle mission without letting Cloud or the other Party members die. After that, there will be yet another boss fight with yet another big robot. Try tackling this using Cloud with restore and an offensive magic (since he has not yet unlocked any better weapons), Barret with Lightning and Elemental Materia on his weapon, so his attacks are counted as super effective against robots (also helpful in the Elevator Battle), and Red XIII with whatever magic you have. After that you will be out of Midgar and in the World Map.;
, This is very lengthy; save before and during this part.
 Buy the Chocobo Lure Materia and some Gysahl Greens.
 The music will be different, so you will know when it comes.
 It will kill you.


Fight the Basilisk later on in the game to get an overpowered Enemy Skill.
Another enemy skill can be found right outside Midgar; wait for the robot things to do Matra Magic, then kill them.
 Treasure can be found in the cave, along with a Materia and enemy skill.
 You will encounter Yuffie and have to fight her. She has 500 HP. By then, Cloud should have his next weapon, obtained in Kalm.
 After that, ask if she wants to go with you, and do not ask her name. She will tell you. Do not open the menu. If she runs away, you can re-encounter her.
