 Evaporated and condensed milk are quite sticky, so you'll need to stir vigorously to ensure they are completely mixed together.


The sweetened condensed milk eliminates the need to add sugar to the recipe; however, it also makes it difficult for you to control the sweetness.;
, Stir frequently for about five minutes. This will help ensure your ingredients are fully combined and also prevent the milk from burning.


Make sure you scrape the sides and bottom of the pot. This is where milk may "catch" and burn., If you want to use additional flavoring, such as nuts, saffron, or fruit, you can add that now, as well.


Try adding finely chopped pistachios, walnuts, or almonds.
Add 4-5 tablespoons of rosewater.
Use just a pinch of saffron.
