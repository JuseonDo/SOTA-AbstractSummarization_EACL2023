 Make sure the water is not too hot, not too cold. Ferrets hate extreme temperatures.;
, Use only ferret shampoo, although baby shampoo may be used if ferret shampoo is not readily available. Other shampoos may cause illnesses or cause eye irritation.
 Avoid getting it's face wet; especially the ears and eyes. Ears can get infected if water gets in them.
 Take a damp cloth and go over the ferrets head, don't use shampoo on it.
, Let it run outside to dry off, use a towel, or get a toy specific for drying them off. (Yes, they do have those.)
