,, This part is all about using the level to test whether your placement is straight and level. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the shims in order to get a straight fit.









Place a level along the hinge side jamb, checking to see that it's straight. If it's not, adjust the middle and lower shims until the level indicates the jamb is straight.
Once completed, place the level at the jamb, checking to see that it's level. If it's not, adjust the jamb and the shims until the level indicates that it's level.
 Then, hammer in nails through the pilot holes at the shims, anchoring the jamb to the wall.
 Make sure that they are as level as possible with the shims on the hinge side.
 Finish the process by hammering in nails at the pilot holes, checking all the while that the jamb is still straight and level.
 Drill pilot holes into the shims at the top of the door frame and then secure them with one nail each. Check to see that the door and the door frame are evenly spaced.
 After drilling, hammer in eight nails at each of these locations, securing the inner jamb to the wall.
 You don't want the heads of nails interfering with the swing of the door.
, Break off either with a hammer or a balled-up fist. File or sand down any small, jagged pieces that may be tougher to get at with a larger implement.
 Use the old trim, if desired, saved from the old door frame, or install new trim to match your new door.
