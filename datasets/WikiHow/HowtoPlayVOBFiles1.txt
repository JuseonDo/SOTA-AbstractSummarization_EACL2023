 VLC Player is a free, open-source video player that can play virtually any type of video file, including VOB format.;
, This should automatically download the correct installer for your operating system. If the wrong installer downloads (for example, if you're using a Mac and an EXE file downloads), click the logo for your operating system underneath the download button.
 This will begin the installation process. You can find this file in your Downloads folder, or in your browser's Downloads section.
 The process is different for Windows and macOS, but you can leave any settings at their defaults.
 After installing VLC, open it from your Start menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).
 This will display the menu options for opening media files.
 This will allow you to open the VIDEO_TS folder that contains your VOB files.
 The folder will usually be labeled VIDEO_TS if it was ripped directly from a DVD.
 When you open the folder, VLC Player will begin playing the video as if you had inserted the DVD. You'll have access to the DVD menus, special features, chapters, and other bonuses.
