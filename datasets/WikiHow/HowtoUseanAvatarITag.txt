 You will see three icons on the i TAG one is of a fist, one is of a plane and the other is an arrow pointing down. If you press the fist the figure of your toy will punch, if you press the plane the figure will shoot using a gun and if you press the arrow pointing down the figure will take out a long knife. Now you can make your figure do whatever you want it to do!
