 Green tea is a good choice because it has anti-inflammatory properties.But if you don’t have green tea, plain black tea will also work fine. After you have steeped the teabags, remove them from the hot water and place them into a plastic baggie., Place the baggie with the teabags in it into the refrigerator (or freezer if you need them faster). Let the teabags chill until they are nice and cold. Then, remove the teabags from the refrigerator or freezer.


Teabags will keep in your refrigerator for up to one week., Place the teabags over the puffiest area of your eyes. To keep the teabags in place, you will need to recline or lay down. Use the opportunity to relax for a few minutes.Squeeze the excess water from the teabags before you apply them to your eyes.
 Discard the teabags after you remove them, do not reuse. You may also want to use a damp cloth to wipe away any tea residue that remains on your eyes after you remove the teabags.
