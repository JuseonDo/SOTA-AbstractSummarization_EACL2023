 The moleskin will adhere to itself providing a soft cushion against the protruding underwire. Some stores and online sites sell moleskin bra fix adhesive patches which will work too.


You can purchase moleskin at either a craft or fabric store.
You will probably also find it at any store with a pharmacy. Look for it wherever the shoe pads are.;
, The smaller the patch, the better, as this help keep the repair looking seamless.
 If possible, move the underwire away from the hole so you have only fabric in that area. Having fabric only will make it easier for you to repair.
 Press it against the hole on your bra. Smooth over the moleskin patch with your thumbs so it adheres in place., Your bra should be fixed for now; breathe easy and wear it again.
