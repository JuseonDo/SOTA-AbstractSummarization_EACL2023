 Try them on and adjust the straps until it fits. If you can, try them on in the water to make sure there are no leaks.


If you have bad eyesight, consider getting a prescription-adjusted mask to help you see underwater without your glasses or using contact lenses. Disposable ones are great for snorkelling in.;
, Make sure the snorkel tube is close to your mouth, but don't put it in yet.
 Place your face in the water at about a 45 degree angle.
 Allow your lips to seal around it and hold the snorkel in place.
 Breath slowly, deeply and cautiously with your mouth through your snorkel. No need to panic: you can always lift your head above water if you want. Just relax and become aware of your breaths. The sound of your breathing through the snorkel barrel should become quite noticeable. Once you get into a rhythm, relax and enjoy the underwater scenery.
 This makes floating on the surface of the water with minimal effort much easier. Many commercial snorkeling locations require a colorful life vest to be worn for safety reasons.
