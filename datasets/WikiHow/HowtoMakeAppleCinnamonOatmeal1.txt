 This recipe will be enough to make two servings.;
, Be sure to cover the pot with a lid so that the steam does not escape. This will take about 5 to 8 minutes.
 You can choose to peel the apple first, or leave it unpeeled. The pieces should be a little smaller than bite-sized.
 During this time, the sugar will caramelize and the apples will soften. Depending on how big the apple pieces are, you may have to cook them a little longer., You can do this using a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Make sure that the apple pieces are evenly mixed in.
 At the point, the oatmeal is ready to eat, but you can give it some extra flavor and texture by adding some yummy toppings. Here are some ideas to get you started:1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons (30 grams) toasted pecans
2 tablespoons (30 grams) granola
Â½ cup (120 milliliters) milk
