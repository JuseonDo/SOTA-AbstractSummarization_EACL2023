@summary
- when you're throwing the ball towards an opponent do not aim for the upper body as it makes it easier for them to dodge it or catch it, aim for the shins as they can't catch it and makes it harder for them to dodge it.

 If nobody on your team is fast, then let the other team get the balls and just stay back and try to dodge and catch. If you and your team do get them, then roll the extras back to your side so the enemy won't get them.;
, Get the average throwers out first so there are less distractions. If you are a bad thrower, just catch them as they get thrown at you.
 This will help you gain power for the throw. If they throw a ball at you while going towards the middle line, crouching and running up to the line will help you dodge it because you are ready to move quickly and you will be a smaller target. This will make it harder for them to hit your body and when they throw it, it will be towards your head and therefore easier to dodge because instead of moving your whole body you will just have to move your head. And, also, in some games of dodgeball, throwing at the head doesn't count!

,, Let it come to your chest and when it is about two feet from you start to bring your hands up to catch it. By the time it hits your chest your hands should be there to make sure that it has nowhere else to go. This should make sure that you catch it.
 TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO STAY ON YOUR FEET. If you fall down it may look cool but it leaves you a sitting duck for attacks.
, Pretend that you are fighting for your life and you are facing your greatest rival.
, Sometimes, it will miss and you can catch it. The oldest trick in the book is to deliberately throw it a little far off from the target, hoping that the person will go in that direction.
 This will help you hit the target.
 Take out the good players first so they don't get teammates out.
 This means no resting or "time outs".
 He/she will most likely try to pick the ball up if he or she does throw the second ball at them.
