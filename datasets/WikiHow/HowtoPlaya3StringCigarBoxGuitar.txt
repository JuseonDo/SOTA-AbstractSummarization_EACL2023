@summary
tune the 3-string cigar box guitar to the key of d (my father’s tuning - dad).

@summary
for review: it is every good boy does fine on the lines (egbdf), and face on the spaces.

@summary
the c major scale has no sharps or flats.

@summary
however, to maintain this same step pattern when starting on the d note, the key of d has two sharps; f# and c#.

@summary
the key of g has only one sharp (f#).

@summary
practice a progression in the key of g.

d chord 12th fret

@summary
though difficult to see, there is a glass slide on the ring finger.

@summary
a classic chord progression: place the slide directly above the metal fret at the 12th position, strum or finger pick 1,2,3,4 beats and move the slide to the next position.

@summary
the progression is what the left hand would play on a piano.

@summary
experiment to find other three or four chord progressions.many 3 chord progressions (1st, 4th, 5th)

@summary
,

@summary
many 4 chord progressions, with "turn-around" (8th, 6th, 4th, 5th).

@summary
tablature: there are probably few examples of cigar box guitar tablature, here is one blues scale riff...

@summary
this progression came from a guitar booklet called basic blues by will schmid.

 There are eight notes between the low D and High D’ strings (an octave).
 On the Bass clef it is Good Boys Do Fine Again and ACE G on the spaces., There is a whole step (skip a fret) between everything except B&C and E&F (1/2 step or next fret up).

From C to C' there is a pattern: W, W, H, W, W, W, H, where W=Whole step (skip a fret) and H=Half step (next fret up)., To play a D Major scale (from low D to high D') follow this second pattern. Practice this pattern with "finger fretting" and also with a slide.
 Similar to the above pattern, except the C is a natural - fret above the B. Start in the 5th fret on G, then play the notes up to high G.
In Western music many chords are made up of a triad; the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a scale. Due to the limitations of this instrument (only 3 strings), a chord is made of the 1st and 5th notes in the scale. For example, an A chord is composed of A and E (and A’). This means a barre placed across the 3 strings will make a chord. Use a glass or steel slide to form the barre (or lay one finger across all three strings). Place the slide directly above the metal fret wire to make a crisp note. Keep the slide parallel with the frets when you move it. Pick a note, then slide a fret or two up or down the neck to the next note.
,,,, Play G (5th fret), C (10th fret), G (5th fret), D (12th fret), G, C, D, C, G or variations thereof.,
Frets: 12th, 9th, 5th, 7th, 12th… repeat three more times; follow-up with a turn-around...
12th, 14th, 12th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 12th., See if you can find the individual notes to a melody that may go to this familiar progression. , G, C, G, D...

The fret numbers are given for the key of D, figure out the fret number for the same progression in the other two keys. Play the 4 chord progression four times, then follow up with the turn-around.,,, The lines represent the strings (fat string at the bottom), the numbers represent the fret to put your finger or slide in.
