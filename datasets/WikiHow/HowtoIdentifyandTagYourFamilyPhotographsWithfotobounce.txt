 There is a version for Windows and one for Mac.;
,


They are both free applications.
They are both executable files and won't need a zip program to install them.
, fotobounce will 'ask' if you want to use My Pictures. If that is where your pictures are, then agree.
, At this time, fotobounce will start scanning the folder (and folders within) for photos. It will take some time, so just step away from the program...for the moment.
 The software will identify faces...some may, or may not, be actual faces. When you identify one, the program will search for other faces that might match.
 This is where you type in the name of the person in the picture.
 This will help the software be more correct.
