 Leave about half an inch for a bit of room to work with. Too tight and you won't be able to get it on and off.

, You want a ring, not a finger trap. If you want an even smaller ring, cut off 2/3 of the duct tape.
 This gives it a zig-zag feel; if you'd like something else, feel free to cut out any design of your choosing. Zig-zag is easy as it doesn't to be perfectly symmetrical to look good.
 Cut one on the right and one on the left. When wrapped around your finger, these notches will keep the ring in its shape.
 There should be no adhesive showing that can get caught on your skin or other material. If there is some, fold it over or cut it off.
 Wrap it around your finger and place one notch into the other. Use another color of duct tape as an accent if you have it available.
