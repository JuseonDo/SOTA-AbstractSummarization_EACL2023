 Move your mouse to the top right-hand corner of the screen and swipe down. A side menu will pop up.
 You will find "Settings" at the bottom of the menu. Click to open the folder.
 A new interface appears when you click "Settings," with six icons at the bottom and five clickable tabs. The first of the six icons should look like five bars, starting small and get larger. If you see this icon, you have a WiFi card in your laptop.
