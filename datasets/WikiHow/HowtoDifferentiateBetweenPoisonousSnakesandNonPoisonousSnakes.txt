 Most venomous snakes usually have triangular shaped heads.;
, Some venomous snakes such as the coral snake have bright colors.
 This is ineffective, because the information you gain from this observation only tells you what time of day the snake is active. Snakes that are nocturnal (hunt during the night) generally have slitted pupils, while snakes that are diurnal (hunt during the day) generally have round pupils. Some of the most venomous snakes in the world have round pupils, but many infamous snakes such as rattlesnakes have the classic slitted pupil.
 A venomous snake normally has a heat-sensitive pit there to locate warm-blooded prey. Non-venomous snakes lack such pits.
 A snake with a rattle on its tail must be a rattlesnake, which is venomous. The Florida Pygmy Rattlesnake often only has one segment of rattle and thus cannot make a warning noise.
 Most venomous snakes have one row of scales there while non-venomous snakes usually have two rows.
 The bottom of the tail (behind the anus) of venomous snakes looks the same as the rest of the belly. If the snake has a cross pattern (like a diamond shape) it is non-venomous. However, this may not be easy to find out, unless the snake is dead.
 Only venomous water snakes swim with their entire bodies visible on the water.
 Two close-set puncture marks would indicate that the snake has fangs and is venomous. By contrast, a ragged bite mark means the snake lacks fangs, which only non-venomous snakes have.







Some colorful snakes, such as the scarlet snakes, the scarlet kingsnake, and the red milk snake, are non-venomous.
The black mamba, the coral snake, the cobra, and the inland taipan snake are venomous but have round pupils. Pupil shape has nothing to do with whether a snake is venomous or not - but it does tell you when the snake likes to be awake!
