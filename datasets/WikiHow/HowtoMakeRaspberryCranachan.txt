 Pour the Framboise liquor over the raspberries and leave them on the side for 2 hours at room temperature.;
, Bake the oatmeal for 6 minutes at 180 °F (82 °C). You'll see that the oatmeal will become slightly dark in color and give off a warm & roasted aroma when it's done.
, Measure and pour half of the whiskey into the cheese bowl and whip them together. Pour in the honey and continue whipping. Add in the other half of the whiskey and stir. Add and fold the whipping cream in. Mix thoroughly until you get a smooth consistency. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
 Spoon over a little of the cream mixture to completely cover the raspberries. Continue alternating layers until each glass is full.
