 If you disagree with your assigned schedule, take it up with management.;
,,, If you must leave for breaks or to deliver items to other areas, let the appropriate co-worker know where you're going and when you intend to return.
,, You don't need to be the fastest/best sweater folder, you just need to work at it.
 You will then be able to use your break time more efficiently, therefore reducing the potential for overextending your breaks and inconveniencing your co-workers, and you will be less likely to try to borrow money from your co-workers.
 Some of your coworkers or customers may be allergic or asthmatic. On the other side of the olfactory coin, it is also helpful to bathe. Daily.
 Tell your customer about late fees on their account, clean up the mess in aisle two, fix the broken shelf that the one kid knocked down. It will make your customers and co-workers happier.
