 Begin with the hard drives data protection – a free tool BestCrypt allows encrypting your entire hard drive, including the operating system area, not only selected folders.

 The main idea of such anonymizing service is that you pass your Internet traffic, you wish to make anonymous, to them, and they will pass it to the destination using their own IP addresses.

 You will not leave trails with your IP address in web server logs, chat room logs, peer-to-peer file sharing systems, newsgroups, mail servers, mailing lists, etc., any longer. No trails – no tracking.
, Another important point is sending the messages securely via a special tunnel, which cannot be snooped. If all these conditions are met, your e-mail messages will be delivered intact with no trails pointing to you (unlike popular services of Google, Yahoo and similar, which keep your IP address). An example of secure email can be found at MuteMail
