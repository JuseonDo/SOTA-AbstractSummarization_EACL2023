The software has been around for a long time and comes widely recommended by experts.,,, It will save to your computer with a name like “ClamXav_2.10_xxx.zip.”,, This will start the installation of ClamXav.

 ClamXav color-codes the results based on recommended actions, such as “quarantining” (isolating it to its own folder so it causes no harm) or deleting the file. Here’s what the colors mean:Blue: If you don’t recognize the file, quarantine it to avoid passing it on to others.
Orange: You should definitely quarantine the file.
