You can also determine the amount of binding by multiplying the length of one side by 2 and the width by 2. Add the results to find out how much binding you need.;
, Use a 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) seam allowance, reducing the amount of bulk by sewing the seam diagonally.,

Pin the binding close to a corner and leave about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) as a tail to tuck under. Catch the front and back of the binding as you are pinning it to the blanket.


Extend the blanket binding past each corner so you can make a diagonal fold.
Turn the corner and look at the underside of the blanket to make sure the corner of the binding looks neat.
Push the extra blanket binding with the head of a pin to get the extra binding inside the mitered corner. Pin both mitered edges on the top and bottom of the blanket. Repeat this step for the remaining 3 blanket corners.
,,

Use a straight stitch, zig-zag stitch or a decorative stitch.
Keep your stitching as straight as you can. Stitch slowly to ensure that you sew a straight line and catch the top and bottom edges of the blanket binding.
