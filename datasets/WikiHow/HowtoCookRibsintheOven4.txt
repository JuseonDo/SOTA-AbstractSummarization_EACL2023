 Use a knife to start it near the narrow end, and pull off in one piece.
 Add sufficient BBQ sauce to cover. Allow to marinate for at least an hour.
 Use plenty of overlapping foil to make a tent. Cover the bottom of the pan with ¼” water or broth.
 Add salt and pepper to taste. Baste the top with more BBQ sauce.
 This is to prevent the acid in the BBQ sauce from corroding the foil and contaminating the sauce.
 Bake at 350ºF or 180ºC for 50 minutes. Remove and let sit for 5 minutes. Open and apply more BBQ sauce. If it seems completely cooked, let it air dry before serving. If it doesn’t seem completely cooked, either return it to oven (open), for 5-7 more minutes at 400ºF or 200ºC, or throw them on the grill just until the BBQ sauce dries on.
 Enjoy!
