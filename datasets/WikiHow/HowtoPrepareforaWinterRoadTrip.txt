 Ask the mechanic to check your vehicle's brakes, lights, oil, tires, exhaust system, heater and defroster.;
, Auto repair stores usually perform this test for free if you don't own your own battery tester. Clean any corrosion from posts and connections.
 Replace any belts and hoses that look worn.
 Read your vehicle manual or ask your mechanic about the best type of oil to use for a winter road trip, as cold temperatures will cause oil to thicken.
 Use a mixture of half water and half antifreeze, which will prevent your radiator from freezing, even in very cold temperatures. Antifreeze is easy to test using an inexpensive antifreeze tester that you can purchase at hardware or auto parts stores. An antifreeze tester is a small plastic gadget that will determine the level and condition of antifreeze in your engine.
,, If you're traveling in a cold climate, use a fluid that is rated for a minimum of −40 °F (−40 °C). Keep an extra container of fluid in the trunk.
 Check your tires often throughout your trip as tire pressure decreases in cold weather and under-inflated tires can be dangerous, especially on slick roads. If you'll be driving in snow, use winter tires which will provide better tracking and improve vehicle braking in the even of a skid.
, Use main roads which are more likely to be plowed or sanded in bad weather. Let at least one friend or family member know your route, destination and your expected arrival time.
 If possible, avoid night driving during inclement weather.
 Include CDs or books on tape. If you're traveling with kids, pack a few games to prevent boredom.
 Carry a car charger for your cell phone, as your cell phone may be your lifeline if you car breaks down or if you're lost or stuck in the snow. Program your phone with any important numbers, such as emergency road service or weather or traffic reports.
