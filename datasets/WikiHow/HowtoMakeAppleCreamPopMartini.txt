 Measure about a tablespoon of the pucker and make sure it's towards the edges.;
, Depending on the quantity of martinis you are planning to make, add a tablespoon or several to the saucer.
 As you lift up the glass, gently swirl it to make a more cleaner appearance.
 Gently roll the rim in it, using the pucker as an adhesive.
 Fill it about halfway with ice.
, Secure the lid on and vigorously shake it for a few seconds. You will know when the contents are cold when you see condensation building up on the outside of the shaker.
 Attach a strainer on the cocktail shaker (if the shaker doesn't have one) and strain it into a martini glass.
 Add the heavy cream as a layered topping.
