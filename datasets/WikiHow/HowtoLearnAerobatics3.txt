 Push the throttle up to full and pitch slightly down. By doing this you are building up the speed to get you up into the vertical.
 Keep the plane heading up. When you are near to falling backwards, push the rudder either left or right.
 It will twist round and start to descend vertically.
 That is the procedure for a stall turn.
