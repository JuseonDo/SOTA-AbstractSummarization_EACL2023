 The salad fork should be toward the far left, the main course fork closer to the plate. (The salad fork is the smaller one).Place the dessert fork above the plate and the dessert spoon above the fork. (The pointy part of the fork will be pointed toward the right, the spoon mouth will be pointed toward the left.)
