@article
 Get them dressed and brush their teeth after they eat breakfast, if you want! Take out toys and games and tell them the responsibilities they have and chores they need to do for example:


Oldest stuffed animal does laundry and cooks.
Middle stuffed animals do the dishes and fold clothes.
Youngest stuffed animals vacuum.

Remember give all the stuffed animals a responsibility no matter what!

;
, If chores are not done, then scold them and give them a not too harsh punishment but they still learn their lesson! At dinner time, feed them a healthy meal and remind them to eat their veggies or no dessert.
 For example, the youngest stuffed animals watch their show first, the middle stuffed animals and then the oldest stuffed animals.
