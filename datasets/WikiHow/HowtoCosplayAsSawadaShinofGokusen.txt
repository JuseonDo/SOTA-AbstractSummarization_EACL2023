 Don't let any emotions show on your face.(Except for boredom and disinterest);
, Talk only when absolutely necessary, and make sure it's intelligent. Use as few words as possible without being unclear.
 If you're not exactly born a genius, study hard but don't show it to anyone. Surprise people by getting the highest grade in exams or tests without looking like you're spending sleepless nights studying for it.
 Don't smile or get flustered under all the attention.
 Do anything you want without making any noise. Sleep if you want to.
 When he does, he hides his face from view before laughing silently or smirking in amusement.
 Whenever someone is talking to Shin he looks off to the side or in another direction.
 If your hair is messy or tousled, let it be.
, It's part of learning how to be independent. If you can't, try to be distant from them, without being impolite.
 When grown-ups are annoying the hell out of you, give them a glare, roll your eyes, before walking lazily away.
 Especially when it comes to dealing with nosy, know-it-all people.
 Don't let every bad incident get under your skin. Shrug it off and move on.
 People may not agree with the way you're dealing with things so learn to be firm with what you believe in and ignore them.
 Learn not to trust people that easily. Be rude to them if you must.Place a wall between you and the people around you. But learn to put down your blinders to people who prove themselves worthy.
 Do not ignore your friends when they speak to you.
 Learn to accept that even the person you hate may make some fine point against what your friend did.
 Act indifferent but show your care in the most subtle way (like saving her skin when she's in deep trouble)
