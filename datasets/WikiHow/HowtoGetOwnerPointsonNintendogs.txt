 Every time you teach a dog a trick you gain points. Enter 9 contests, get 3 dogs and if you train it will be easy to enter one dog in three contests in one day.;
, Every time you bathe or shower you dog brush it. I mean people do that in real life.



If you play fetch with your puppy and then pet it, stars will show up meaning you got points.
If you pet you dog after it does a trick stars will show up and you got points

,, The more it likes you the more points.
