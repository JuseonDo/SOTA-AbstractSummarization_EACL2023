recognize that things may not be “fair.” not everyone will have the same idea about how to divide heirlooms “fairly.” for example, if you make more money than your sister, she may believe that she should get more from the estate, your brother may want the stamp collection to be donated to a museum, and you may want everything to be sold and the proceeds split evenly.

 Whether you are dividing heirlooms before or after a loved one has passed it is critical to have a non-partisan third party involved.It is important to have a person there without emotional attachment to the items. Consider hiring a professional arbitrator or asking a priest to help your family.
, Remember that there are many people and feelings involved in this experience.Think about what is most important to you from the division of heirlooms, and listen to what is most important for each other family member. You will not be completely satisfied with what happens, but maintaining family relationships is more important than getting everything you want.
 Emotions can run high when people begin getting sentimental over family heirlooms. If there is a particular item that everyone is arguing over, put it aside, take a break, and come back to it later. Sometimes family members begin arguing because of hurt feelings rather than a real desire for an item.It’s important to give yourself time away from the argument to calm down.
