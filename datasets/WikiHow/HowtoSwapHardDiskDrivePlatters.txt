 You have tried everything else, your data is not extremely important, and/or your cash flow restricts the use of a professional service.;
, You can not make a super clean environment at home but use some common sense, and do the best you can. Keep air flow to a minimum.
,, If you don't know what is, or how to do it, ask Google.
 If the cover doesn’t just lift off, look for more screws! There are screws under labels.
 If they are scratched, scorched, warped, or otherwise damaged, stop you are done!

, You can still try if you like.
, Make sure you can read and write data to and from it.
, This is your chance to learn how they are assembled, if you slip and damage parts you can get a new donor. NOTE: if you are dealing with multiple platters they cannot be removed without the proper equipment, because misalignment of the platters will destroy any chance of recovering data. You need a platter removal tool. The next steps are only if you are dealing with a single platter.
,,, You might only get one or two chances to read from the HDD. It might make some horrible noises.
 Continued use of the HDD is ill-advised.
