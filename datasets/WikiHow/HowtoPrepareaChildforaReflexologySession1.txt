 Pulling and squeezing your baby’s toes during this game easily becomes a reflexology treatment.


The reflex points for the head, neck and throat are located on the toes, so playing this game from a reflexology perspective is a perfect way to help your baby recover from colds and sore throats.;
, Squeezing your baby’s foot with a soapy washcloth will most likely hit every reflex point on his/her tiny foot. Make it a game by pointing out the soap bubbles squeezing through his/her toes.
