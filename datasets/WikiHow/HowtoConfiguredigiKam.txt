, If you don't know what you are doing with this setting, leave it alone.
 This one can, and should, be fine-tuned as you become familiar with digiKam. You can select the way you will be seeing the album.
 This is the easier place and way to add categories for your images.
 You can select what you want to see for your tool tips. Obviously, if you have opted not to see the tool tips, don't worry about this one.
 Metadata tells you the basic information (and some non-basic) about your image.
 Put in the basic information that you think you will want on your images.
 This is another section that you won't need to change unless you already know what you are doing.
 The light table is used to compare images.
 This will help you with seeing under and over exposure. Using the default settings is a pretty good start for this.
 You have a variety of types and settings to choose from.
 Experience will help you fine tune these settings.
 This is, be default, off. If you are a professional and have what is needed, this is where you change it. Otherwise, leave it off.
 There are a lot of plug-ins that are enabled. If you have memory issues, or at least if your computer does, you might want to disable these. However, the more plugins that you have, the more that you can do with digiKam.
 You can change the timing, what is seen and many other things here.
 You can add your camera(s) here.
 You can change any of these. Take into consideration what you are working with, e.g. memory, time, etc.
