 Before an EPUB file can be read on a Kindle Fire or Paperwhite, you’ll need to convert the file to the MOBI format in a converter like Calibre. See Using Calibre on a Computer to learn how to install and add books to Calibre.

Other converters are available, and most work similarly to Calibre. Use caution if you decide to install an EPUB converter with which you are unfamiliar, as other free software downloads may contain adware.
 Click to select the book(s) you want to convert., An output screen will appear.,, Converting the file will not affect the original EPUB file, but you’ll only see one entry in the library for both formats., Now you’ll prepare to copy the MOBI file to your Kindle., A submenu will appear with several sharing options.
, This is the folder where your Kindle books must be stored to be readable on your device., It may take several moments to appear in your list of copied books on your Kindle.
