 Most juices are fine, but if your juice is on the sour side, you may need to sweeten it up a bit. Keep in mind that your juice has to be sweeter than the normal juice you drink because you are making candy out of it.
 You want your juice to become thick (kind of like the consistency of syrup.) You can continue adding sugar if you want to.,, Lower the string into the glass, keeping it straight, until the pencil touches the rim and stays there.,, Your candy is ready if the sugar crystals have stuck on the string. If not, it may just need more time or there wasn't enough sugar in the juice.
