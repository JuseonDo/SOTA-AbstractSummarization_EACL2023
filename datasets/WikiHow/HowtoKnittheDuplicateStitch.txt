@summary
understand that duplicate stitch simply means covering existing stitches with a different coloured yarn to create a picture, monograms, or words.

@summary
follow a chart or you can make your own duplicate stitch using graph paper.

@summary
remember that duplicate stitches can be removed if you want to create a new picture.

@summary
knit your garment.

@summary
thread the needle with the yarn.

@summary
working from right to left, pull the needle through the bottom of the first stitch you wish to cover (and top of the stitch underneath), insert it right to left through both loops of the stitch above and pull gently.

@summary
understand the different processes for making vertical or horizontal stitches.

@summary
attach the loose ends by knitting into the back of a stitch and cut ends.

@article
 Imagine drawing a picture and then going over parts of it with a different coloured pen to create a nicer picture. It looks like embroidery but is actually knit.;
, Each square represents one stitch. Be creative! Here are some examples of small motifs taken from an antique pattern book.


A girl
A butterfly
A bird
A flower

, Be careful however as the colour may have faded and the colour under the stitches may look darker. If not, you can remove the stitches and put a new picture on. This is great for children's garments.
 Now put away your knitting needles and bring out a darning needle. Use the same size yarn of a different colour. If you have knit your article with 4-ply worsted yarn, use the same type of yarn so that your stitches are covered evenly.
 Remember, too much yarn means tangles, too little yarn means you tie more knots.
 You will now see the right side of the stitch covered. Bring the needle down and through the same place as your beginning stitch. You now have one stitch covered.









Don't pull too tightly or you will have a crumple. Don't leave too loose or your stitches will hang. Keep your tension the same as the knitted article. This will take practice.










To make vertical stitches, insert the needle through the stitch above the original stitch and repeat.
To make horizontal stitches, insert the needle through the stitch to the left of the original stitch and repeat.
