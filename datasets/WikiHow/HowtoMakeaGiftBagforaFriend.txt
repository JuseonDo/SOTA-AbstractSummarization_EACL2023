 You could also use a medium size bucket, tin or box just anything that will fit in your locker or in your backpack so it is easily accessible for when your friend needs a little cheering up. It also needs to be small so they can take it home with them if they need to.;
, Make sure it's not something very strong because that could give her a headache. You never know. It's better to be safe, than sorry. Also put a mini deodorant and a small cheap, but nice smelling body splash. Be careful that your friend doesn't take offence and assume you have a low opinion of her standard of personal hygiene.
 She might be having a bad day because it's that time of the month. Put 2 tampons, 2 pads, and 3 panty liners. You never know what they prefer. Some girls only use pads, some only use tampons so just put everything in there.
 If they don't like plain water, then they can have some lemonade. If they do like water, then they don't have to drink it.
 Something that will fill them up a little bit if they didn't have breakfast. You can also either put some money or a food bar in there if they forgot lunch money.
 Also put a tinted lip balm in there. Like a Baby Lips. Oil blotting sheets are life savers it some girls with oils skin. If they are breaking out, put a 2 hour clear up gel in there.
 Also put mints and tissues.
 Everyone loves a snuggle buddy!

, Any other voucher will be suitable as long as the recipient is a fan of the store.
 This little gift will let your friend know that you care about them and want to make them feel better. A nice way to decorate it is to simply add a little bow like on Christmas present. Also add a name tag that says To: My friend, I hope you feel better! From: Your name
