 Whichever method you choose, be aware that freezing doesn't sterilize strawberries; it preserves them. As such, be sure to only use the best quality strawberries and to ensure that they're well washed and dried first. Moreover, don't expect miracles from frozen strawberries. Upon thawing, they will be softer, sometimes quite mushy, and they will have darkened in color. They will also have a different taste texture from fresh strawberries. Just be aware of this and be prepared to use them in ways befitting their condition upon thawing.
, This will help to prevent freezer burn and keep the berries fresh.


You may wish to cut the strawberries into smaller, bite-sized pieces. This can be done before freezing to lessen the freezing time needed, or after they come out of the freezer.
