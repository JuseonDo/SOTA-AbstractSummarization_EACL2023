 They should be close together, to either side of the hairline, and about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart. You need them close because you will be twisting them into one bun.
 Twist each section into a rope. Next, twist the two ropes into a thicker rope; make sure that you are twisting in the opposite direction. Secure the rope with a hair tie. Repeat this step for the other ponytail.









Use clear elastics, if you can.
If your hair is thin, you can muss up the rope braids with your fingers for extra volume.
 Wrap the braid going counter-clockwise. Pull it over the left braid, then under it. Keep doing this until you run out of hair. Leave the center empty, like a doughnut.








Secure the bun with bobby pins as you go.
 Tuck the end of the braid under the left braid. Secure it with more bobby pins.
 Make sure that you go counter-clockwise, as before. This time, however, wrap it into a spiral in the center of the "doughnut" or ring. Secure it with more bobby pins as you go. Be sure to tuck the end of the braid out of sight.
 Tuck in any loose pieces with more bobby pins. You can also opt to leave them alone for a messier look. When you are done, spray your bun with hairspray.
