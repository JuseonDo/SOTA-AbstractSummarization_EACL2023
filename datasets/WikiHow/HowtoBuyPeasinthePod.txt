 Pods that are split open means that the peas are overripe and they will not taste as good and may be starchy. Overripe peas can still be used for soups and stews, however.;
, The best pods will have a fresh colour. Duller pods are older and have probably been sitting around for a while.,, Shelling peas causes the sugar in them to quickly deteriorate., Fresh, good peas should "pop" or crack as they are being shelled., This is an indication that they have dried out.
