Ollies aren't that hard to learn, but require a lot of practice. Once you have the Ollie down, everything else will be a breeze.;
,,

If you need to, bend down until your knees are tucked into your chest and tap the tail of the board onto the ground.

Do this by bringing your back foot up while you are still in the air.


Once you have the Ollie down, you're ready to go!
