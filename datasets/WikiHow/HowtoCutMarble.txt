You can also use a reciprocating dry diamond blade, but you risk shattering the marble.
Put on protective eyewear, hearing protection and gloves before you start cutting.;
,









Water keeps the blade from overheating, protecting the blade/saw and the marble.
,









Placing the marble correctly helps protect your fingers from the blade.










Forcing the marble into the blade can cause the marble to crack and can result in an injury.
,









Gentle movements will keep the marble from breaking.
Apply dry/wet sandpaper to smooth the marble edges.
You can start with an 120 grit and move upward to a 2500 grit paper. This will make the edge of your marble smooth. Do not use too coarse a grit as it may scratch the marble.
 Sweep up your work area well to remove small pieces of sharp marble on the floor.


Ensure the wet saw has been wiped down and cooled properly before being put away or returned.
