 You can use an 8-inch or 9-inch (20.32 or 22.86 centimeters) pan. Leave about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of foil hanging over the edges of the pan. This will make the fudge easier to remove once it's done.


You can also use two sheets of wax paper or parchment paper. Lay them down in both directions in the pan so that the bottom and all four sides are covered.;
, Place a heavy-duty saucepan on the stove and add the chocolate chips and condensed milk. Turn the heat to low wait until the chocolate melts. Stir the mixture often to help the chocolate melt evenly. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 You can also omit the walnuts, if you wish. The vanilla extract is important because it will help add another layer of sweetness and flavor to the fudge.
 Hold the saucepan over the baking pan, and use a spatula to help guide the mixture into it.
 This will take at least 2 hours depending on the temperature of your fridge. Don't get impatient! The fudge has to be firm before you cut it, or it will make a mess.
 Once the fudge is firm, grip the edges of the foil like handles, and gently pull the foil out. Set it down onto a sheet of wax paper.
 There is enough fudge to make 48 good-sized pieces. You can also cut them into smaller, 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) sized pieces as well.
 Cover any leftovers and store them in the fridge. It should last for about 1 week in the fridge.
