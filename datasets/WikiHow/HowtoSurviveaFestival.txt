 This is a good idea because the showers at such festivals are slightly unhygienic and probably cold.;
, This will keep it well refrigerated and you don't have to sample any of the fast food stuff! But if greasy spoons (which are quite nice as an occasional treat) are your thing, then take plenty of money because food and drinks there tend to be twice as much as the average KFC where you live.
 If kids are coming with you, have them at your side at all times. Children get lost very, very easily at these things and your child/children getting lost can be a very traumatic experience. But if you do get lost, make sure you report it to one of the festival tents; these should be located in several places around the grounds. Also, a good tip is to write your mobile/cell phone number on your child's arm so if someone can ring you if they find your child.
 It is a lot safer there than it is around the tent.
 12% of A&E emergencies are due to dangerous actions at gigs.
 Sunday night is bonfire night, and they might trash or burn your tent! Alternatively, take it down (if it's worth taking down) and leave at a cloakroom or in a car.
 Walking back from a gig in the middle of the night can be a real nightmare otherwise!

, Wet clothes can be horrific to wear the next day!

, They will completely wreck your festival experience and you could get very very much in trouble - by the police and getting hurt by using the drugs themselves.
,, Either they're not there or the line is ten thousand miles long.
