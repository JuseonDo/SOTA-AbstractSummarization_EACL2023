 Using System Restore would be pointless, as you'd end up losing too much recent data in the process. If you have intentionally deleted the Internet history and are now in a desperate need to get it back, then this is what can help you.


A desktop search will also not be of much help in such cases. The log files are where all the operations that you perform in your system are stored. A look into the log files can also let you recover deleted Internet history.
All Windows computers have this file extension that stores arbitrary data, the .DAT extension. In our scenario, the system uses a file called 'index.dat', that stores all the information of the operations you have performed.
, You will have three tabs in this window, the second of which is View.
 There will be another check box under it called "Hide protected operating system files" (Recommended).


Remove the check in its box. Apply changes and exit the window.



You should now have multiple index.dat files in the search results.

To read a .dat file, we need to know the software that created the file. Sometimes, .jpg, .avi, .doc, etc. file extensions get renamed to .dat. In our case, we need to get the software that programmers used to create the index.dat files to read them.


Try using Notepad through the Open With option, but more than half the information displayed will be garbage that you won't understand.
 WinSpy is an example of such a reader.
