 Not all users make their photos downloadable. You’ll know a photo can be downloaded if you see a downward-pointing arrow beneath the photo on the right side.
 A short list of image sizes available for download will appear. To see an even longer list, click “View all sizes.”


The higher the resolution, the larger the image.
If you don’t see many higher resolutions, the image may just be small, or the owner of the image has chosen not to share all sizes.
 The download link will say something like “Download the Large 1024 size of this photo,” though the actual text depends on the selected image size.
 Select a folder, then click “Save” to download the image.
