 Stretch legs and arms, and jog around for a few minutes.;
, Slowly bend at the knees keeping your back straight. Crouch down as low as possible arms on your waist and slowly rise back up.
 Arms at your waist again, do this slowly but steadily.This is the most crucial part so do it several other times before exploding.
 Do this quickly, by almost touching your bottom to the ground, then explode upwards as high as you can. As you come down, land with your bottom near the ground (like the starting point)and then immediately launch back up again.
 Change to the other foot, and do the same thing.
 Stand in front of it (with knees shoulder width apart). Gather yourself and leap onto the flat surface (Be sure to leave both feet at the same time). Jump back off the surface and try to land softly on your feet. Repeat quickly as many times as you can--it's the quickness that will build up fast-twitch muscles and make your results practical. Rest for as short a time as you can manage and begin again. You'll be able to slam dunk in no time. Pro tip: Try to picture yourself landing as softly as 'Spiderman' when you jump on the table. If you can manage it people will tell you it looked like you were kind of floating. Very cool.
