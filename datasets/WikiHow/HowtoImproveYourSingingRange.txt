 To find warm-ups for singing, consult a local choir director or find a video on YouTube.;
, Using a piano, begin on a note a fifth lower than a note at the top of your comfortable singing range. Slide your voice up a fifth and back down to your starting note. Move up a half step each time until you absolutely cannot sing the note at the top. If singing a certain note hurts, STOP. The last thing you want to do is hurt your voice. It is okay if your voice cracks, these should be notes you're not yet comfortable singing. After a couple of days doing this exercise, you should find that you can sing some higher notes than before.
 Repeat the same exercise, but sliding downward and each time going progressively lower.
 E.g. (breathe in) la (breathe out).
,, It makes it harder for the air to come out.
,,, It will damage your singing voice forever!

, This is a muscle near your stomach that helps you to sing. Place your hands on your lower back. When you breathe in to sing, you should feel your hands move back. A huge part of singing is breath control, and if you can properly control your breathing, it will be that much easier to sing notes you aren't yet comfortable with.
