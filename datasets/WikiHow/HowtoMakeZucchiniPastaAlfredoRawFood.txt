 You will need a spiral slicer to produce the length and single size needed.;
, Then, cut off the ends and spin them individually in the slicer. As you do so, turn them into beautiful little curly ribbons of squash.


If preferred, cut them down into manageable strips for easier consumption.
 Mix until smooth and creamy.
 Garnish with fresh parsley. It's now ready to serve.
