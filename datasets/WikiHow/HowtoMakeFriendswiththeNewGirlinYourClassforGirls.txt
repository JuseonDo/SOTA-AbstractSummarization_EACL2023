@article
 Something like 'Hi, My name is . What's yours?';
, Remember, she's probably heard 'So what school are you from?' 100 times already. Instead of asking her the same thing, try getting a little more creative and ask things such as, "What are your favorite sports?" or, "What TV shows do you like?" See if you have anything in common!

, If you compliment her too much, or compliment her on something you aren't sincere about, she'll see right through you, and you may even come across as fake.
 She's probably extremely nervous. The nicer you are, the more comfortable she'll feel around you, and the sooner you can become friends.


, Fill her in with what had been going on before she came.
 For example, if she's wearing hooped earrings and the school only allows studs, tell her. Just try not to make it seem like you're singling her out or picking on her. You could phrase it as something like, "Yeah, I wish I could wear hoops, but the teachers said they were against school rules."

, You should probably do this after a couple of days, just so you don't come across as too clingy.
 Make her feel like part of your group.
 Smile!

, Instead, try to clear her doubts.
