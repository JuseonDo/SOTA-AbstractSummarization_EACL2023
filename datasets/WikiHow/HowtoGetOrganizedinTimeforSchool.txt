 Don't wait until the day before you plan to have to be organized!;
, If you're searching for a "things to buy" list, look in the things to buy pile. This makes everything easier, so you don't have to be swamped head to toe with lists and never-ending chores!

,, This helps you organize your to-do lists and make them smaller!

, It's a great way to organize your thoughts and, who knows? You might set up a day of doing school related things with a friend!

,, Take your "books read over the summer" list and put it in your folder, take your 5 paragraph essay and put it in your folder, take anything you wrote for your teacher and put it in your folder! Gather all you materials and put them into different compartments.
 Remember that you don't have to change your personality to be accepted. You don't have to be a "girly-girl" or a "goth". You can wear black and pink together, dye your hair blue and move on without a care. Remember that "being yourself" doesn't mean picking out a personality! It means just doing what you feel like (within reason of course).
 Go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 6 or 7 in the morning. Dream! Rest! Now, wake up and get dressed. Eat a great breakfast and go to school! Don't forget to have a great day!
