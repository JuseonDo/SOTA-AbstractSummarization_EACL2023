 Being in stress is like racing a car with pulled brakes. Imagine what it is doing to your system.;
, Sort it out in your mind with counteractive thoughts and suggestions.
, Inhale deeply and completely. With each inhalation, your abdomen will rise, and with each exhalation, your abdomen will sink in. Close your eyes.
 Feel as though you are sinking into the floor, until you feel this heaviness all across your body.
 Continue this for five minutes.
 Once you have done this for a reasonable amount of time, slowly open your eyes.
