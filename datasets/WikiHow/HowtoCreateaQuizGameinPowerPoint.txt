 slide. But you have to do it one by one.
 Then the user will put the mouse on the square, then he/she will have to cross to the other square, without touching a certain color in the background. If he/she couldn't figure it out, the answer is to right-click, which deactivates the power-point presentation, making it impossible to touch the color, to the game over slide.
 Draw a custom button somewhere in the slide, then add a slide. In the previous slide with the custom action button, hyperlink it to the the next slide, but this time, click the 'Mouse Over' tab, making it hyperlink when the cursor is hovered over the shape.
 Then add another slide, making the second custom action button you drew, hyperlink to this slide. In the previous slide where you have the two shapes, insert/shapes/action button/custom. Draw a custom action button around the slide, which fills up the whole thing, hyperlink it to the game over slide. Once you've done that, right click/send to back. Then fill it with color with the ones you wish.
