 Place your lips between C and D. Cup your hand around the end of the horn and open it as you blow, making a low "bwaaa" sound.
 Place lips between B and C making a "waaaaaa" sound.
 Not everyone can make this call. However, if you can, place your lips between A and B. Flutter your tongue while blowing.
 For cottontail, place lips between B and C and blow a small amount of air. For jackrabbit do the same, but add a little "hum" to it.
 Pronounced KYE-yie. This is an injured coyote. For an adult, keep on the horn but for a pup, take it off. Place lips between A and B and blow in short bursts of air. Try to sound like a hurt puppy.
 This isn't really a distress. Blow short breaths with lips on D. "Grunt grunt."
