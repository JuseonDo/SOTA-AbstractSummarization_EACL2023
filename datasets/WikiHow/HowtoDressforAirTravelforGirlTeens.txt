 This is an airport, not a catwalk. Comfortable clothes are best because they don't annoy you on your flight.
 Try to wear layers in case it gets colder or warmer on the plane!, Sandals may seem like a good idea, but it can get cold on the plane. Opt for slip-on flats or comfy sneakers. Slip-ons would be the best to wear because you may have to remove your shoes for a security check. Also try to avoid high heels. They can easily compromise your ability to move if you must run to the gate., Wear it down or in a ponytail, but be aware that it's hard to comfortably get your head on the headrest with a ponytail sticking out., Put all of your small things in a carry-on bag to store beneath a seat, instead of an open-topped purse (which things could fall out of).
