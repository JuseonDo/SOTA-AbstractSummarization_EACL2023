 You can start the Command Prompt by pressing ⊞ Win+R and typing cmd into the Run box. If you are using Windows 8, you can also press ⊞ Win+X and select Command Prompt from the menu.
 Use the Command Prompt navigation commands to open the location that you want your folder to reside in.
 To create a folder in your current location, type mkdir foldername and press ↵ Enter. You can open your new folder by typing cd foldername.
 You can create a set of directories inside each other with one command. This is useful if you are building a directory tree that you're going to populate later. Add the -p flag to your mkdir command to add multiple directories nested in each other. For example mkdir -p Vacation\Images\Favorites would create the Vacation directory in your current location, with the Images directory inside, and the Favorites directory located inside the Images directory.
 Once you have your folder created, you can start populating it with files. See this guide for details on copying files.
