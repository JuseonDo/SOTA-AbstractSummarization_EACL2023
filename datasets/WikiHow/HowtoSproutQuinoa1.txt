 For this project you’ll need a fine mesh strainer, 2/3 cup of quinoa seeds, a bowl, water, a tray or plate, cloth, and a sealed glass container or plastic bag. , You need to wash the quinoa seeds to remove the soapy outer coating, which is known as saponin. Quinoa should always be rinsed prior to sprouting and cooking.
 Quinoa is small, so you need to make sure you don’t lose any grains. After rinsing the saponin from the quinoa, use a fine-mesh strainer to collect the rinsed quinoa while draining the soapy water into the sink. Transfer the quinoa to a seed sprouter or into a second bowl.
 If you have a seed sprouter, you can transfer your quinoa to that at this time.
