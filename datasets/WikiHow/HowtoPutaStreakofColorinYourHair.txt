 Make sure it's something you can deal with in a couple weeks or a month or two. After all, it is permanent.;

The color you want in your hair (can be permanent or semi/demi permanent)
Foil
Clips
Plastic combs
At home, find an old shirt that you don't mind ruining.
Hair bleaching kit

, This can be time consuming.
, Hair dye can get messy, and you don't want to dye your hair in uneven pieces.
 Make all of the mixture, even if you don't think you need it. It's better to have too much than not enough.
 Don't put too much on the comb or it will fall onto the other parts. Repeat this until you have enough on your piece of hair.
 Wait about 30 minutes.
 Is it light enough? It might take longer if you've dyed your hair in the past.
 Make sure you get it all out. You can use a shampoo but no conditioner! The conditioner will interfere with the color you're putting in it. Make sure you don't lose the chunk of bleached hair in the mix.
,, If it is a semi/demi permanent color, it should already be mixed. If not, follow the directions to mix the dye.
 You may want to put a little more of the color than the bleach in because it is not as powerful.
 Sometimes, the instructions recommend you blow dry the section. This can make the color more vibrant.
 The color can soak in and be more vibrant this way.
 This time, you can use conditioner.
 You can now show off your personality everywhere you go!
