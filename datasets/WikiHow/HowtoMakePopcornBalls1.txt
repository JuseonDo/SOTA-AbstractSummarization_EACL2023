 Pour the light corn syrup into a saucepan, then stir in the butter, water, confectioners' sugar, and marshmallows. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it starts to boil., stirring often to prevent scorching or burning., Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often to ensure that you get the popcorn at the bottom.


You can buy plain, pre-popped popcorn from the store, or you can make your own using the microwave or stove.
 Try to make each ball about 3Â½ inches (8.89-centimeters) wide. Place the popcorn balls onto a baking sheet covered with wax paper as you finish them; you can also use greased cupcake or muffin pans instead.


Keep some extra butter or shortening on hand. If the popcorn starts to stick to your hands, simply coat your hands with more butter or shortening.
 This will take about 30 minutes. After this, you can serve the popcorn balls.
