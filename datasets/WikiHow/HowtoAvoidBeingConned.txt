, This is a classic con-artist trick. A legitimate banker should ask you to phone the bank where you can do whatever it is that needs doing. If someone asks for bank details over the phone, put the phone down.
 Some of these will have viruses attached which begin working when you open the email.
 If you click any link or send any details, you've just given the con artists what they want.
 This should help to filter out junk mail straight away, without you getting involved.
 If you do this, you could end up being targeted much more often than otherwise.
 Most of these are cons. There is no easy way to make lots of money without working hard to get it. Anyone who offers you the chance to make thousands is probably looking to take thousands from you.
 If you see anything suspicious, report it to the fraud department of your card.
 If you fall foul of even one fraud, your name and address could be spread throughout the conning community as a target for further fraud.
 Football and concert ticket scams are frighteningly common, and often very sophisticated. Make sure that any ticket broker is legitimate before you deal with them. Search for people's service history with them on external sites, and check for registration with an official organisation such as FIFA. Remember that many con sites of this type will have logos, and will look official, although they're not.
