if your electra heart is beating wildly for marina's new vintage look, then why not try thrift stores or charity shops?,

@summary
always try to add a little bang to your outfit, be it with a cute cartoon purse or a sweet necklace.

@summary
marina's more casual look seems to be made of hipster essentials, such as thick black tights, cute little skirts and high waisted jeans, but remember not everyone has the same body shape.

make up wise, try to stay as classic as possible.

 We can't all happily wander around in dresses that look like adorable hippos!;
, Whether it be her beautiful brown locks from the start of her career, or the wild pastel blonde of Electra Heart, you should always remember to consult a professional before dying your hair too light or too dark. A guide is not to go two shades above or below your natural hair colour if you D.I.Y it, but if you are comfortable and able to do it yourself, then there are all manor of things you could try!

, They are excellent ways to find something that no one else will have, and they always offer a new and cheap alternative to high street stores. Just don't forget to launder them first, as many second hand shops will only steam the clothes before selling them.
 Aim to purchase things that have a reference to pop culture, and aim for bright and bold. Anything to do with cartoons or comics is always a good place to start.
 Find things that not only remind you of Marina's style, but make you feel comfortable, confident and most of all, remind you that you are you. Its good to take inspiration from others, but the best thing you can do it be you!

, A flick of black eye liner and a pouty red lip never go amiss. If you adore her video for "Primadonna", you will notice she has changed the red for a pastel pink, and added some luscious long false lashes, very baby doll! If you're feeling especially brave, why not give yourself a little heart shaped beauty spot? Remember the rule of make up though! Never combine a big dramatic eye shade with a bold lip. Try to stick to one or the other. Keep your lines simple and clean and experiment with colour! See what you can turn Marina's starting point into!
