borrow a current ring.

alternatively, use a pencil and paper to trace the inside of the ring.

@summary
if you do not have any paper, slip one of your partner's rings onto your own finger as far down as it will comfortably go.

@summary
ask your partner's friends and family.

@summary
ask your partner.

@summary
choose a setting and a band that can be resized easily.

@summary
err on the side of “too big” rather than “too small.” it is easier and cheaper for a jeweler to size down a large ring than it is to size up a small ring.

 Make sure you choose a ring that fits their finger, but look for one that they will not notice missing for a few days. Take it to a jeweler and ask to determine the size.
 Take the sketch with you to a jeweler and ask to determine the size from that. This way, you do not need to sneak anything out.
 Mark the stopping point with a pen, and show the mark to a jeweler for an assessment.
 Your partner may have shared information about their ring size specifically for occasions like this. Ask someone your partner has a close relationship with, but make sure to ask someone who can keep a secret.
 Partners who know that an engagement could be around the corner, may offer you the information willingly.
 In spite of all your precautions, the ring could still end up being the wrong size. Finger size may even change at some point in the future. Bands covered in multiple diamonds or those that feature other decorative elements along the side can be difficult, if not impossible, to resize, and the cost of doing so will be higher than with a simple, solid band and a traditional solitaire setting.
 If you feel uncertain about the ring size, choose an option that is slightly larger instead of one that seems too small.
