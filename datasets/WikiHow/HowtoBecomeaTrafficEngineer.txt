 in the U.S.; P.Eng in Canada) through the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES). Requirements vary by state but are generally:


Earning an engineering degree from an accredited program.
Successfully completing the Fundamentals of Engineering exam.
Working as an engineer for at least 4 years.
Taking the Civil Engineering-Transportation exam and receiving a passing score.
 Exams are offered 3 times per year for the following certifications:


Professional Transportation Planner (PTP).
Professional Traffic Operations Engineer (PTOE).



Continuing education is very important as new standards and new designs are developed.
