 If you are using a letterhead you don’t need to put the sender’s address. Instead, begin the letter with the date in the top left corner.
 Do not leave a blank line between the sender’s address and date.
 One line is two hard returns on a keyboard., This lets the recipient know what the letter will be about.
 This is where you discuss your subject. Be concise but thorough in your discussion of the subject.
 Do not any closing remarks such as ‘sincerely’. Below your name, leave room for your signature. Below your signature, write your job title.
 Enclosures are extra materials sent along with the letter. Write the word ‘Enclosure’ and then list the names of the enclosed materials.
 Make sure all names and addresses are spelled correctly.
