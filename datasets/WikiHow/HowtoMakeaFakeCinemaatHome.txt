 Go to some shops for cheap snacks and stuff like that for example: Popcorn (sweet or salted), Crisps, Drinks, Ice Cream, Sweets(Pick & Mix or Kit Kat ext.);
,, Choose a room big enough to fit the people who are going to be there. Then set up the chairs and screen. Then set up the shop with the snacks because you don't want the people to starve (make a menu or special offers).
 You can choose a theme to a film or just choose a film randomly or even make the film yourself. And advertise it and say when it's going to be on,what time and the price and how long it's gonna take.
