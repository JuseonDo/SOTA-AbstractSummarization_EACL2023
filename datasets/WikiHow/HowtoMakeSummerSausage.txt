 Check the pantry for curing mix, mustard seed, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt and liquid smoke before going to the store. Buy 5 lbs. fresh ground meat, or defrost previously-purchased meat.









Place the 5 lbs. (2.27 kg) of sausage meat into a large mixing bowl and begin breaking it up by hand. Use any ground meat you want, such as hamburger, ground pork, or ground venison. Most recipes call for a meat with plenty of fat.
Mix in 5 rounded tsp. (24.64 mL) of curing mix, 1/4 cup (2 oz) mustard seed, 3 tbsp. (1.5 oz) garlic powder, 1 tsp. (4.93 mL) cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp. (14.8 mL) salt, and 1/2 tsp. (2.5 mL) liquid smoke. Combine the ingredients by hand to incorporate all spices and seasonings into the meat.;
, Keep the meat in the bowl for chilling purposes.









Mix well by hand 1 time per day while the mixture is refrigerating.
 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C).
 Roll each section of meat back and forth on a cutting board or counter top into even loaves.
 Bake at 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) for 8 hours.
,, The sausage is typically served on its own, or with bread, crackers or cheese.
