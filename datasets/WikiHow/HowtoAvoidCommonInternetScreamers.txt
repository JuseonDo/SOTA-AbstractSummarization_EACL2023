@summary
any videos which are too short are probably screamers.
@article
 Anything with a title which seems unusual such as '100 feet (30.5Â m) snake' could be a screamer. Paranormal videos are most likely to be screamers because of the subject and requirement for the user to look closely for the 'ghost'.;
, If it says things such as 'That was scary!' you can tell it is a screamer. However, comments can be disabled and if it is an unusual/paranormal video and the comments are disabled the chances are it is screamer!

, However, if you are watching a video, pause the video and slowly scroll through it. If it says 'watch closely' at all you can be pretty sure it's a screamer! Or if you see some unusual or scary pictures in the video you know it's a internet screamer.
, If the title is ' Michael Jackson seen alive in his house' and the video is 30 seconds long it is suspect!
