@summary
mix the top coat paint with the hardener and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes.

@summary
apply the top coat using the same technique you used with the epoxy coating.

let the top coat dry 24 hours before walking on it, and 72 hours before parking a vehicle on it.

@article
 Stir the mixture for 1 more minute before beginning.


If you want an anti-skid surface, add the anti-skid granules during the last 1 minute mixing time. Anti-skid additives are a good idea for floors that may get wet from foot traffic and snow-covered tires.
 Paint all the edges, then work in sections until you have the entire surface covered. The top coating is a milky color when applied, but it dries clear.
