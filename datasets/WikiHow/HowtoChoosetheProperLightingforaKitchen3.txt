 Accent lighting draws the eyes to a certain painting or architectural element in your kitchen. For example, if you have a beautiful collection of china arranged on an open cupboard, you may want to highlight it.


Consider lighting above your cabinets if you have high ceilings. This will give a classy tone to the room and make it look large and warm.
 Many of these can be installed onto the ceiling.
 Accent lighting usually requires more smaller bulbs than the larger task and accent lights, because they have less of an influence on your everyday tasks.
