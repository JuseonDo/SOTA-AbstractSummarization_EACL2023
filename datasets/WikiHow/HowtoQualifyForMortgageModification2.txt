 If the value of your home has not dropped too dramatically, you may be able to modify your loan directly with your lender, avoiding the federal program.


Make sure the home is your primary residence. Most banks will only modify a mortgage on the house you live in.
 You will have a hard time convincing your bank to modify your mortgage if you do not have a reliable source of income.
 Your mortgage should be less than the home's value to qualify for a modification with your bank.
 This could be a higher interest rate than when you took out the mortgage, a change in job or circumstance or an unexpected financial catastrophe.
 Some lenders will not modify until you are in danger of foreclosure, others might be willing to help even when you are current in your payments.
