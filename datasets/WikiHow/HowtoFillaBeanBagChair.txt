 Return the package immediately if there is a problem.;
, Higher quality bean bag chairs, constructed of materials such as leather, tend to be more durable, less likely to puncture and provide greater longevity, but a variety of other materials are available.
 One person holds the chair open while the other carefully pours the filling into the chair. Fill the chair in a room with no breeze, so the light filling doesn't blow around and make the procedure more difficult.
 Some zippers have locks to keep the zipper closed. Others have special patches to keep them safe around small children.
 You'll notice right away a sinking feeling like sitting in quick sand, as the filling settles and trapped air is pushed out of the chair.
, Your chair will be your new best friend. Oh, and don’t forget to get out of your chair and clean up your mess!
