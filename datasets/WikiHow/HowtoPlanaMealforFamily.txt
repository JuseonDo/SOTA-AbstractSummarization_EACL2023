 If it's strictly for close family, then write down who. If you want family friends or extended family, add them accordingly. Be careful not to invite too many people.;
, See that this date is commonly open for your attendants.
 Write a list of things that you are skilled at making. Don't try first time recipes, as they may fail. Consider any food allergies. Consider enough ingredients to make more food than you need. This way, you can send people with leftovers, or keep them for the day after.
 Confirm date, time, food of preference, and anything else.
 Consider if you want to use stoneware dishes or paper.
 If several potatoes need to be chopped, do so now. Cook everything the day of the meal for best flavor unless the recipe states otherwise. Cook the food so that it'll be done shortly after guests arrive. Let the food cool and rest for about 10-15 minutes. This way the food will be warm and fresh. During this time, set the table. Before food is done, set out some crackers and cheese and serve drinks to satisfy guests.
 This gives them time to digest a little. Now, move the guests to a sitting area. Serve some coffee or dessert drinks.
