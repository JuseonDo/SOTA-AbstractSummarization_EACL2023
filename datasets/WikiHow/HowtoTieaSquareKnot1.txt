To make this knot, you need two strings, ropes, etc. Alternatively, you can use the opposite ends of a single rope.
In our example, we'll lay the right-hand rope (the orange one in the graphic above) over the left-hand rope (the yellow one). However, if you lay the left-hand rope over the right-hand rope instead, you can still get a square knot if you reverse all of the following directions.;
,









The end of the right-hand rope should now be pointing out to the left (and vice versa.)
Note that the first two steps for making a square knot are the same as you'd use for tying your shoes.










This is, again, identical to how you would begin tying a pair of shoes.
At this point, you should have what is known as a half knot.If you were to repeat the steps above again, you'd get a standard overhand knot.










Notice that the rope going over the top is still the orange rope in the graphic above. The end of this rope will be on the left at the start of this step, but it's still the rope that was originally on the right, so it's the rope you'll lay over the top here.










This is virtually the same as in Step 2, just going in the opposite direction since the original right-hand rope is now coming from the left.










Try to pull all four "slack" lengths of rope with equal force. If you don't, the knot may not hold its shape and may even come apart as you tighten it.










From the front, your square knot should look like the one in the graphic above. You can also find good reference images at AnimatedKnots.com and other knot sites.If you have tightened the rope correctly, you should see that it forms a neat, even knot from two loops with one loop wrapping around the base of the other.










Untying the square knot is simple â€” just grab the round part of each loop in your hands and pull in opposite directions. The knot should come apart easily.
