 Chihuahuas should be at least three months old before being given a bath.;
, This step is especially important for long-haired varieties. This will remove tangle's and large debris from their fur and make bath time a smoother, more enjoyable experience.
, Talk in a gentle tone. Keep your body language soft and inviting, and don't make any fast movements.
 Avoid getting water in their eyes, face, or ears.
 Smooth the shampoo into your Chihuahua's fur, making sure to get their tail, belly, and legs.
 Scrub your Chihuahua's fur gently, working the shampoo into a thick lather. Avoid digging into your pet's skin with your fingernails or hurting them. Be sure to get the top of their head and their neck, but avoid getting soap onto the face.
 Be sure to rinse well and get all of the soap from their fur.
 Set them on a towel to avoid getting your floor too wet.
 Gently wrap a towel around your dog and towel dry. Don't be too rough. Dry thoroughly, getting as much water off your dog as you can.
