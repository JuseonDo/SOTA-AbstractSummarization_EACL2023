 Make sure it's an ICON, not a photo because it has to be within a certain dimension. A really good site is http://expressions.aim.com/browseExpressions.jsp;
, This should be indicated by a small bubble near the time display, if you are using Windows.
 At the bottom of it, click on settings.
 There will be a list of options on the side, so click on Expressions. It's the 7th one down. At the right hand top corner, your current icon/picture will appear.
 On the window with your icon, click and drag the icon over the picture in the Expressions window. You will get a message telling you to make sure you aren't using copyrighted material. Click OK, and then you have your icon!,, Click on it once.
