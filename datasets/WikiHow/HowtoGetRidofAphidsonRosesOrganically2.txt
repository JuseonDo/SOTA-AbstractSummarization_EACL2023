 Get enough lady beetles to release 1,500 the first time and another 1,500 a week later.


The lady beetles, much like lacewing larvae, syrphid fly larvae and soldier beetles, will kill the aphids, but they generally do not hang around the roses very long., This will give them a moist environment and hopefully encourage them to stay around longer., You want to do everything you can to encourage the lady beetles to stick around your roses and eat up any pesky aphids.
