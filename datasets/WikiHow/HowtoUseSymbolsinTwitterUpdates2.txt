 Hashtag symbols are often used to categorize certain Tweets so that they can display in searches for a specific keyword or phrase, or to mark or bring attention to specific keywords. For example, if you enjoy Tweeting about politics, choose a major keyword to use with the hashtag symbol, such as "republican" or "democrat."

, For example, if you post Twitter updates about movies, add a hashtag to the beginning of movies so it displays as "#movies."


When adding a hashtag to a phrase, make sure there are no spaces between the words in your phrase, otherwise the hashtag will not recognize the phrase in its entirety. For example, when adding a hashtag to the phrase "my favorite song," type the phrase as "#myfavoritesong."

, According to Twitter's best practice guidelines, your Twitter updates should usually be limited to 2 hashtags per Tweet to prevent your Tweets from resembling spam.
