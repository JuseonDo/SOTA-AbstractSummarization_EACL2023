The glow plug wires are beneath the engine's valve covers. You will find one end attached to the top of the glow plug and the other attached to the engine. Remove the wire attached to the glow plug. Remove the small nut that holds the wires to the glow plugs with a wrench. Push the wire aside. Repeat this process to remove each glow plug wire.



Loosen each glow plug from their sockets using a ratchet.



Similar to battery contacts, glow plug wires can become dirty, which can result in a poor electrical connection.



This is just to clean out the glow plug hole, so ream only long enough to remove any buildup.



Tighten them just to the point of slight resistance. If you tighten them too much, the next time you need to change the glow plugs you might break one off trying to remove it. This can result in a costly repair.
