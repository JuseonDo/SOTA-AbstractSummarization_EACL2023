 This is a necessary step to make pushing the cuticles away from the nails easier. If the cuticles are not soft and you try to push them, you might tear the skin, causing painful lesions.
 You can also use cuticle oil together with the cuticle remover. Make sure to spread it evenly all over the edges. Leave it for 2 minutes.
 This will help soften the cuticles even more.
