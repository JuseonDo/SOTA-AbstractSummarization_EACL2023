 Blackheads, whiteheads, acne, excessive oil can be cleared.


Cleanse and moisturize daily (in the morning and at night before you go to sleep) with products such as Proactive (for acne prone skin) or other formula for your skin type (if you have dry, oily, normal or combination skin).
 Going to the beach is not healthy because of UV rays. And a tanning bed is even worse! Buy a self-tanner or bronzer.
