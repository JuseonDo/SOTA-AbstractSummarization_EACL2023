,, You have 4 options to choose from for saving your chat text history: 2 weeks, 1 month,  3 months, forever.

Obviously if you want to always keep your chat text saved forever, click on  the "forever" option.


You  just made  your  chat text saved forever.  In case you changed your mind and don't want  to keep it "forever," just adjust the settings again.
