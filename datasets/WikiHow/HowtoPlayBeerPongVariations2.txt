 Three beers per side, evenly distributed.
 Beer Pong players throw the ball across the beer pong table, trying to get the ball in a cup. When a ball lands in a cup, one player from that side must chug that cup, and it is removed from the play area (pushing it to the side is OK). When both players on a team sink a cup, they get the balls back.
 One player drinks the first beer cup, the other drinks the second, the first player drinks the third, and so on. Throwing can either be alternated or done two at a time. Some people think that throwing two at a time improves accuracy, but studies are inconclusive. It's up to you and your partner.
 If it bounces in, great, but you'd better hope your opponents have no reflexes. Bouncing it in counts for two cups.



When 4 cups remain on a side, re-stack them in a diamond formation.
When 2 cups remain, they are placed one in front of the other.
When one cup remains, it is placed in the corner of the table.
 If the losing team manages to clear all of the winning team's cups while matching, both teams resume the game with three cups and one beer per side.
