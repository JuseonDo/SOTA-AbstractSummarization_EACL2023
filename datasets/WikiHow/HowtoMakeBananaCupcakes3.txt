 You can do this using a handheld mixer or an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Be sure to use a medium speed setting., Keep mixing until the sugar and vanilla are evenly distributed throughout the butter mixture. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 If you don't have any heavy cream, you can use half-and-half instead. Give the frosting a taste; if it is too sweet, add a pinch of salt and mix again. If it is too thin, add some more sugar. If it is too thick, add some more heavy cream.
 Once the cupcakes have completely cooled, you can spread the frosting on top using a spatula, or pipe it on using a piping bag and decorator's tip.


For an added touch, sprinkle the cupcakes with some mini chocolate chips.
