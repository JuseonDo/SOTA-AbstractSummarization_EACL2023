 This helps with fatigue and comfort as well.;
, Also, see recipe for 'super simple honey brew for colds' in tips. Good old fashioned canned or homemade chicken noodle or vegetable soup, or any warm, broth-y soup is really good for coughs, as well as sore throats. Also, cold ice cream in your favorite flavor (although doesn't provide long-term relief) can be very comforting and can temporarily soothe a scratchy throat.
 But if that's not an option for you, (for example, if it's mandatory for you to go to work, school, or make an appearance somewhere) try one or all of the following: drink lukewarm water mixed with some sea salt and fresh or bottled lemon, avoid cold beverages, try to make yourself sneeze, press hard below your nose (upper lip) for two minutes (and every 15 minutes after that).
, Watch or read something funny, wear something colorful, or listen to some upbeat music, laughter is the best medicine!
