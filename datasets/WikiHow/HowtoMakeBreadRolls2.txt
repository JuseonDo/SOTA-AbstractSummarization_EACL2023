Add the egg., You can use your hands or a mixing spoon; if you have a dough hook, that can be used if wished. Once the dough has formed together, tip it out onto a floured surface for kneading., During this time, it should feel elastic and look and feel smooth., Add some cling film that has a light layer of oil on it over the top of the dough in the bowl. Put the bowl in a warm place and leave the dough to rise. It should double in size, which will take about an hour., Knock down with your fist, then knead again for 2 to 3 minutes., Roll gently into balls., Do not touch them together, allow plenty of room for expansion. Place a lightly oiled sheet of cling film over the top of the rolls. Once again, set aside in a warm place to rise, leaving them to double in bulk. This should take about half an hour., Set the oven to 220ºC / 425ºF. If you want to make a glaze for the rolls at this point, mix together 1 egg yolk with 15ml/1 tablespoon water and spread over the top of the rolls when they have finished rising. Poppy or sesame seeds can be sprinkled over this glaze before baking., Remove the wrap when the rolls have risen. Place into the preheated oven. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they appear golden., The dinner rolls can be served warm or cooled down, depending on your needs.
