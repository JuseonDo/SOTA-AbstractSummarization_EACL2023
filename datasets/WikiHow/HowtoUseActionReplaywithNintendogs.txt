 The console itself is about $125. Pick the DS right for you, they have Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite, Nintendo DSi, and Nintendo DSi XL in different colors, like black, white, blue, red (only DSi XL) and pink.;
, Action Replay will only work with this version.
 It does not matter which dog you want to start off with.
 It will give you 99 of each item, max Trainer Points and 1 point away from a million, the most you can have.
, Pick the dog you want as your first, then just follow the game directions. It will let you pick your dog's name, teach you how to call it, and how to teach your dog to sit. Once this is all done, the game will let you save and do whatever you want. Save the game and then turn it off.
, Note: Before you go onto the next step, make sure you choose all the dogs you want and the room you'll want to stay in for the entire game. Once you do the next step, you will not be able to buy any more dogs or change your room.
 This time, select "All items". Turn on Nintendogs and start enjoying your game!
