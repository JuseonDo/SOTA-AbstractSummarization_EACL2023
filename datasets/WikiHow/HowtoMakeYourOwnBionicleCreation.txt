 You can get ideas from animals, mythological creatures, or just make up your own design completely.;
, This means avoiding more than 3 main colors and choosing coordinating colors such as blue, orange, lime-green and dark green. Try experimenting with exotic colour schemes, such as Blue Orange-Yellow and black, red and green or (if you have the parts, this is very hard to get the parts) yellow and purple. Black will go with any color.
 For a humanoid creation, you might want to use a Bionicle Kanohi mask.
, If you wish, you can upload it to the Lego website for other Bionicle fans to see! you can also use this site for inspiration.
