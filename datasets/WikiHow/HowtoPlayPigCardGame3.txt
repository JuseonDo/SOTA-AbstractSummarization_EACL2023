@article
 Cut the paper into strips 2.5in (6.3cm) long and 1.5in (3.8cm). Cut as many strips as you can.



Write a letter from the word PIG onto each strip like this: P-I-G-P-I-G-P-I-G and so on.
Mark each strip on the opposite side with a tiny number so that you don't mix everything up.
 Turn the letters face down so that the sides with the tiny numbers are showing.
 When someone is declared Pig, they must turn over a letter. When all three letters are showing, the player leaves the game.


The last player in the game wins.
