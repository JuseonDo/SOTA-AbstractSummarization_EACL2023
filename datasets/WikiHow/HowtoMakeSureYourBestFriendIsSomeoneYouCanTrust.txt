@article
 Did you just meet them? Are they a childhood friend? A good trusting friend should be someone you knew throughout your whole life.;
, (problems,hobbies,etc.) If your friend is a trusting person. Telling them whatever is on your mind shouldn't be a problem.
 If you notice this friend is hanging out with the wrong group of people or do things that give them a bad image. I suggest staying away from that friend since they could influence you in the wrong ways.
 Think about any disputes you had with this friend. Are you the one who apologizes first? Is it them? Are they friends worth keeping even when you fight?
