@article
 Be sure the bottom of the straw is folded under (crimped) so the powder doesnâ€™t leak out.
 Push the powder downward, using a thin stick.
 You can either add another staple or even a small piece of tape if you plan to either serve immediately or place the pixie sticks upright.
 The pixie sticks can be served immediately or kept refrigerated for use later.
