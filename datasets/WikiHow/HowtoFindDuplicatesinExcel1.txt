If you instead wish to display all unique values, you can select "Unique" instead.
 The highlight color will designate duplicates. The default is light red with dark red text.,, You won't want to delete these values if each piece of data represents something (e.g., a survey).


Once you delete a one-time duplicate, its partner value will lose its highlight.

 If you're satisfied with your revisions, you have successfully found and deleted duplicates in Excel!
