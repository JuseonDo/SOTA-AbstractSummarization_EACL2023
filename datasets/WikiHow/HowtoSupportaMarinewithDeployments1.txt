 This is the time where he wants that kind of attention & wishes to spend every minute with the people he cares about.;
, Make sure the proper people have the correct general and specific "Powers of Attorney." You never want to waste an international call on something that could have been talked about in person. Have someone you absolutely trust added to his bank account to keep it in check, etc.
, This eliminates the question, "Where's Daddy?"

, Listen to him on what he wants - it's going to be his non-military essentials for a few months! So if he wants cigarettes or local perishable food (canned or non-refrigerated), give it to him. Gather all the necessary stuff and send it as soon as you get the address of his station. It takes a package to be sent (either way) between a week and a month.
