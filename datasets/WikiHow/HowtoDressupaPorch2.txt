 Even if your porch is very large, you should arrange your furniture proportionally. You can use masking tape or painter’s tape to mark off the spaces for the furniture you have in mind. That way, you’ll know if the pieces you have in mind will fit comfortably on your porch and whether or not your arrangement as a whole will look balanced., While it is ideal for your decorative touches to have functionality as well as appeal, placing small pieces on either side of your main entrance is very welcoming., This seating arrangement is far more inviting than having all your seating facing in one direction, such as towards the street., Soft lighting creates a wonderful ambiance during the evening hours., The lattice lets in light, but provides some shade and privacy.
