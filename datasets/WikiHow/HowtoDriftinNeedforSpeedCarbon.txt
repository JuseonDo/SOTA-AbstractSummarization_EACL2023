,,, As a general strategy, release the gas when the car is sliding towards the outside, and pull the e-brake when it slides towards the inside.


Pulling the e-brake will cause the car to slide further towards the outside of the track, which also helps the car spin more.






Your speed affects the points you gain exponentially.






Using NOS will make the car tend to go straight.;
, Flooring the gas will cause the car to slide and the car spins at a normal rate. Releasing the gas will cause the car to go to the inside more, and spins at a higher rate.
 Do not be afraid to hit the walls when ending your combos. You will still get half of the points and the multiplier, so it is always better to hit the sides trying to go fast than drifting like a turtle for the entire course.
