 These are listed in the "Things You'll Need" section below.;
, Any measuring device will work, as long as it's accurate. (Note: The picture shows a 5" wrist measurement.)

, The photos show the example of adding 8" (12.7cm) and then doubling (to 26"), but better to be safe than sorry.
,, If you did this correctly, it should appear symmetrical.
 With this first knot, it's important that it's centered, so while you're pulling the ends apart, hold onto the very ends of the string.
 It's quite alright if it goes over the knot, it's supposed to do that.
 Add one dark bead on each string, and add one medium bead on each string.
 This pattern should look similar to the tightly-bundled section of beads (see the figure in the previous step) that are closest to the clasp.
 Now, put the two strings together, and thread one light bead through them. Continue in this fashion until you only have one more section to do before the bracelet fits you.


Along the way, make sure you check how much longer the bracelet needs to be every once in a while. If you overdo it, you're going to have to start all over again.
 It's fine if it slides down over the beads in this last section.
,, Don't forget to mention to your friends that you made it all by yourself (with the help of wikiHow, of course)!
