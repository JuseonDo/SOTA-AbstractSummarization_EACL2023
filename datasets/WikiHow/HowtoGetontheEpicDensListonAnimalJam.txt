 Do you want a theme for your den? Animal Jam chooses creative dens that had lots of effort put into them. Let your imagination fly!;
, While many players are under the mistaken belief that if they unlock their den, something "bad" will happen, this is incorrect. Just unlock your den once it's in the best and coolest looking form.
 Once your den is unlocked, host a party, or a club. (Parties are most common.)


Go to Jamaa Township and create an event held at your den that many people like. Animal Jam chooses dens that many Jammers enjoy going to and checking out. Say something like, "Girls meet boys my den. Make it full please!" or "Epic dance party my den!" Any event will do to get people to go to your den.
 It might take a while, but be patient. Try the most common world, Aldan.
