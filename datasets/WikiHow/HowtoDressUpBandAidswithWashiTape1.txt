determine the types of designs you’d like to create on the band-aids.
@article
 You have several options such as:


Covering the whole of the Band-Aid or only a portion of it.
Cutting out a shape in the Washi tape that will fit within the Band-Aid strip. Ideas for shapes include: a star, an animal's head or some letters.
You could even choose Washi tape that matches the colors or patterns of your child’s outfit.;
