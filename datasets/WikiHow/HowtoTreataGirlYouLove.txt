 Most girls prefer this over "hot," "fine," or "sexy." Although she may not agree with your compliment, she will be happy for being sweet!;
, Holding hands is a sign of trust, and she will feel closer to you.
 Softly, and just a quick peck. It will make her feel loved and cared like a princess, and safe with you.
 It feels very loving to wake up to a sweet voice or message. This is a great start to brighten up her day!

, It will comfort and relax her, to know there is someone that loves her deeply.
 Tell her that you are there for her and how much she means to you. Kiss her and comfort her.
 If she likes hugs, give her hugs. If she likes a certain thing (perfume, clothing, cell phone, etc.), maybe you can consider buying one for her on a special occasion, such as her birthday. She will notice that you had paid attention, and will be gratified.
 Have her meet and get to know your family.
 If she reacts uncomfortable, then break that ice with a joke or flirty comment about her hair. Don't mess up her hair though.
 This is playful and will bring in some laughter. If she seems or feels uncomfortable though, don't do it anymore.
 Have a conversation together. Bring up some jokes and make her happy.
 She will feel happy that someone cares about her.
 This is a really warm and tender way to show your care for her.
 You can apologize, and hug her. Show her you are sorry.
 Playful and fun!
