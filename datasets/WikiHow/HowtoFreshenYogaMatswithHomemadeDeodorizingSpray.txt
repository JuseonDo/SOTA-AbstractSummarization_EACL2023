 If you plan to just freshen your mat, consider using the tea tree oil as part of your oil combination to act as a cleaning/drying agent.;
, Mix 1 part warm water with 3 parts white vinegar. Add 8 to 12 drops of your choice of oil(s).
 Once ingredients have been added to the spray bottle add the lid and tip bottle back and forth in order to combine oil, water and vinegar (if using vinegar).
 In order to thoroughly clean the mat, first remove any dirt, debris or dust.
 Hit the especially stinky or dirty areas with extra spray and allow mat to sit.
 Clean and emphasize the areas that are especially dirty/smelly, adding spray if needed. Cleaning the mat with the cloth should also remove not only the odor and dirt but soak up the spray.
 Make sure the other side is relatively dry before attacking the other side and you are working on a clean surface (so you donâ€™t re-soil the side you just cleaned).
