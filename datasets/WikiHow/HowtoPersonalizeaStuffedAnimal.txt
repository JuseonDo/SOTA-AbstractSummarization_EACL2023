 Maybe you want your plushie to look super girly, or maybe covered in animal prints. The choices are endless!;
, Gently poke it through and secure the back. Studded earrings will work better than hoop earrings. Don't choose one that's too heavy; you wouldn't want a one-eared teddy!

, You can make any shape you want and color it in. Don't forget to write its name! Then, you can cover it in packing tape as lamination. Find any string or rope to secure the tag to. There's your collar!

, Be sure that they will be easy to slip on and off. Also, make sure it won't choke your plushie. If it does, after awhile it could wear out the material and your pet's head could pop off!

, Whole outfits or just booties or hats: it doesn't matter, they are all super cute. If you don't want to cover up your buddies body, that's okay! You can still use something small, like a hat or a scarf.
 This shows personality. If you don't want to do that, you could also stitch up the rip with neon thread in a cool stitching pattern!

Make an eye patch covering the hole! You can bejewel it, write your pal's name on it, etc.
Find a fun little button and sew that on to replace it.
You can make it a spectacle if you don't do anything to the eye, or make it glasses if you sew it back on or sewed on a button.
 Take a permanent marker and draw whatever! If you use that method, PRACTICE first! Another way to make a tattoo is to embroider one on. Again, you will want to practice beforehand. Note that tattoos are permanent and will not come off if you mess up or dislike it!
