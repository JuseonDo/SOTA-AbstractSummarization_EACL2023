, Pictures and old notes are great for this.
 It helps to be constantly writing; write a little bit every day. While you're waiting for a class to start or in a boring lecture are prime times.
 This is very important! If you do start liking other guys, make sure you constantly compare them to your missionary. Make sure you emphasize things that you like more about your missionary, and be sure to stew over the things that bother you about the non-missionary guys. If there isn't anything that bothers you, pretend there is (so live with a discipline...).
 The non-missionaries are harder to fight off when you're irresistible.
 This should be true whether your lover is home or not -- but especially when he is away: make sure you pursue hobbies and passions without making any excuse about being too busy. Life experience, in any form, makes you a far greater partner.
