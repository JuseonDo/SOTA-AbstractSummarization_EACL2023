 The file and folder directory on Memopal mirrors the file and folder directory from the source computer where the backed up folders came from.
 Navigate through the folders by clicking on them.
 In order for you to see the deleted files inside the folder you’re in, click on the folder with the recycle icon on the header toolbar. The current folder view will be refreshed and it will show you the files that are no longer in the local folder that this folder syncs with. These files were deleted from your local folder and will appear italicized and grayed out.
 The files will be highlighted.
 If you’re downloading more than one file, they will all be compressed in one zip file.
 Once the files have been downloaded, you have now recovered the files you’ve previously deleted locally.
