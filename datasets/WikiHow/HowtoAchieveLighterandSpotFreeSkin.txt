 If you feel that you do not get thirsty very quickly, try doing some exercise by running in your garden or even in the house. You can also try reading a long passage or having a long phone conversation. You'll definitely feel out of breath and want a drink.;
, It'll feel odd for a bit, but you'll soon get used to it. You'll enjoy it, and your skin will also feel and look great. They help with spots a lot!

, They increase the spots and are bad for your health.
 While it may sound kind of weird, it helps in the lightening of skin and gives it a glowing and supple appearance.
 This is the best aid for lightening. If you are an Asian with brown skin and would like lighter skin, these masks are recommended as well as ideal for you.
 Apply to skin and leave on for at least half an hour, then rinse with plain tepid water. Don't use any facial wash because it will reverse the action of the mask.
, Let it dry, and then in a bowl, mash half a banana and mix in 4 tablespoons of orange or lemon juice (don't use bottled, use from the fruit), then mix in 2 teaspoons of honey and mix thoroughly. Leave it to settle for 5 minutes, then apply to skin and leave for at least 1 hour. Wash with cold water. You can keep a towel on your clothes, because this is a messy process.
 But, make sure you only use one kind of mask in one go. For example, don't use the honey mask in the morning, then the lemon mask at night, etc.
 Do this everyday. Also, applying Sudocrem to the spots every night makes a huge difference.
, Aim for SPF 50 and higher, with brands such as Olay, Garnier and Loreal. Ensure that you're not just putting on sunscreen in summer. It's important that you wear sunscreen every time you go outside and that if you are staying outside for long periods of time, you apply it frequently.


Check to see if the sunscreen is water resistant. Usually, if you're in water, the sunscreen will lose its affect sooner so remember to keep track of time.
