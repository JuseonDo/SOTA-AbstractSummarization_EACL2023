management console commands

@summary
management console provides two levels of management:

@summary
level 1 – for management of device types supported by the simulator (add and remove device type, start and stop devices).
@article

By default, the simulator service process is running on the same server as the management console - in such a case confirm the default  parameters by pressing "y" at the prompt: Read default connection parameters ? The default connection parameters are 127.0.01:43500 (localhost as the the host name and 43500 for TCP port).
Once connected, use HELPcommand to see available options.
 Device type is considered as a group of devices using the same SNMP record file.

Level 2– for management of devices (agent instances) under current device type (start, stop, add, remove devices).

A specific set of commands is available for each level. In order to see all available command for the current level, use HELP command.
