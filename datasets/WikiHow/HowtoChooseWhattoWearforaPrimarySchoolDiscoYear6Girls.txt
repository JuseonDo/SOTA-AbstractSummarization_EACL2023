 It's no use assembling the perfect outfit and makeup if you can't go!;
, Preppy, girly, or even a sporty!

, or that pair of black sheer tights with a pair of shorts with a cool top and leather jacket! ( or if you have one, a denim jacket of the same shade as the jeans! Don't wear a different shade of denim jacket or you will look like you are simply wearing clothes ). Wear comfy boots or flats. Make sure they look stylish though!

, Maybe even a nice pair of sandals would work!

, Add a matching pair of sneakers and a track suit jacket ( roll up sleeves and unzipped! ) Who knows, it may become the next new trend for these events!!!!!

, These should be a rosy blusher, bold lipstick, subtle eye shadow.
 Make it look natural so blend it down the cheek a bit too.
,,, Enjoy the dance!!!
