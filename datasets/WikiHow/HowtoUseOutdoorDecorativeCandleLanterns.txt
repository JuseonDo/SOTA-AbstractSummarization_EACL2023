 From glass candle lanterns to metals based decorative lanterns, there is a design likely to work for your needs.


Four-sided metal lanterns with glass windows are the most common types of candle lanterns. The windows should move easily for placing a candle inside.
Wooden decorative lanterns are an equally good choice. Housing a large clear glass pane, these lanterns usually have two slopes on both sides where lower slope contains a steep angle than the upper slope.;
, Regardless of the shape and size, the main highlight of every decorative candle lantern is its glass windows. This is the means by which you can prevent the candle from blowing out when outside, as well as having its light clearly seen wherever it's placed outside.


The glass can be engraved in various stylish patterns and designs, while some are decorated with metal silhouettes or have historical designs imprinted on them.
 Use for an evening celebration outdoors or a romantic candlelit dinner on the beach, where using a candle without covering is impossible.
 This can be excellent for Halloween, to guide trick and treaters to your door safely.
