 The exact amount of drink mix or gelatin mix required depends on desired color saturation. One packet to approximately one pound (half a kilogram) of material is a good start.Your fabric item should be made from natural fibers, like cotton. It will work best on animal based fibers like silk and wool. Plant fibers, such as cotton and linen, will yield light, muted colors.Man-made fibers like polyester will not take or hold dye. Cotton/Polyester blends can be dyed, but will produce a mottled (heathered) effect.;
, This may mean putting on gloves to prevent dyeing your hands, an apron to avoid staining your clothing, and putting down plastic over carpeting or furniture.
 Add about a cup (250 ml) of of very hot water to powder, mix well. Once mix is completely dissolved, pour this mix into the washing machine. Start washing machine cycle using hot water.
 Be sure to stop the cycle once item is covered completely with water. Use stick to poke item and make sure it's completely submerged. Sometimes air bubbles will keep items afloat.
 Try to wring out a corner so you see color of item, not color of dye bath. Colors will lighten significantly after rinsing and when dry.
,, If drip drying be sure to protect area below item in case it drips.
