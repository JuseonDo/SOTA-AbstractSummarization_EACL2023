 You can either put them one by one into the bowl you will make your BBQ Powder in, or you can put each amount into a separate small dish or bowl then add them one by one to your mixing bowl. You may prefer to use the separate dish method if you're apt to be heavy handed.
 Ensure they are combined together and that there are no clumps of any one of the ingredients., Rub into meat, sprinkle over vegetables or combine with a suitable oil to make a marinade, olive oil would be a good choice., It should last three months. The flavours will fade eventually.
