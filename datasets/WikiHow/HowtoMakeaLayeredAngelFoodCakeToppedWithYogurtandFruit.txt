 Use a bowl that is only wide enough (from the center pedestal outwards) to fit the first layer of an angel food cake. It must be several inches deep.;
, Don't just rip the angel food cake to pull it apart, and avoid any jagged or unsightly cuts. Don't use a knife; a cake server will help you slice it evenly.


Place the second layer of the angel food cake to the side. You'll be placing the cut piece back on top of the other layer momentarily.
It is best if you cut the cake outside of the bowl.
 Some fruit ideas include (but aren't limited to): peaches, strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, raspberries, etc. You can get as creative as you'd like with the sweetness here, and choose any of your favorites.


Try to fully coat from edge to edge the bottom of the angel food cake for a rich experience and so the next layer doesn't seem to crumple unevenly when placed above this layer of fruit. Don't just use the center and coat an inch or two from the center outward.
 While you may not want to use plain yogurt, a fairly bland one is ideal; the blander the yogurt, the more the sweetness from the fruits stands out. French Vanilla or some other very basic flavor works best.
 This is optional, but doing so can add yet more sweetness.
 Think of this sandwich cake like an Oreo cookie: The two layers of cake are like the brown cookie and the fruity mixture is the filling.


You don't have to be a baking artist to put this cake together. It will fall apart when served. As long as you keep it chilled before serving, your cake will stay edible for several days.
