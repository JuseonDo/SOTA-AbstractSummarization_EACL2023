, Be able to describe what material the item being shipped is made of.
 There are many different types of allowable packaging systems for freight including, but not limited to, pallets, drums, reels, crates, tubes, or bundles.


You will also need to specify to a shipper if the contents of the package you are shipping need a lift gate to load it onto a truck.
 The U.S. Department of Transportation's code of federal regulations, title 49 defines hazardous materials.
, Sometimes a weight must be estimated, especially if the object cannot be packed until you have determined its class and know the packing requirements.
 Some online calculators will do this step for you by asking for the weight and dimensions of the shipment. You should calculate the density yourself to double-check any quotes given to you.
 If not density rated you do not need this step you can skip to step 9 or 10 to allow a carrier, broker or the NMFC to assist you in finding the correct number.



If you are using a calculator with a particular shipper, you may have to sign in or create an account.
Some shippers will ask that a telephone number or email address be supplied so that they can call you with a quote for the freight class of your package.
