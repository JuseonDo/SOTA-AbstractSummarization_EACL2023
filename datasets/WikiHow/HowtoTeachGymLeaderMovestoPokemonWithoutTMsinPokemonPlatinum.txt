 To unlock the Battleground you first need to beat the Pokémon League, then head to Stark Mountain and finish the Team Galactic plot there.;
, To get the National Dex you must see every Pokémon in the Sinnoh Dex, except Phione.
 They can be found on the northern part of route 212 with the Poke Radar at level 23. Be careful to not use a move on it for the first turn (Throw a Poke Ball instead), so that its Sketch will fail.
 You may want to use the Day Care for some of the lower levels.
 It is the building directly left of the Pokémon Center in the Survival Area. Your rival should be standing out the front.
 If the Gym Leader you want isn't here today, try again tomorrow.
 This is easier if you train the Smeargle strong enough to attack first.
 The female Pokémon species you choose is the species of Pokémon that will learn the move.
