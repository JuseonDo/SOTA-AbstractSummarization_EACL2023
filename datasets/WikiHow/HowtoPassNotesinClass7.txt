If you have a mechanical pencil, take off the top part (where you usually put in the lead) and put your note in there. Then put the top back on and pass it to your friend. It will seem like you were just lending them a pencil.
Alternatively, this also works with pens with caps and removable grips. Just follow the same steps as for mechanical pencils, but keep hold of the removed grip, and pass the pen holding the cap so as to cover the note.
