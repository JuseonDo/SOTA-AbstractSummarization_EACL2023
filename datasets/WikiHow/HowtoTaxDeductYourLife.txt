 Everyone must choose to itemize their deductions (which tally up the expenses you actually incurred)or take the standard deduction, which everyone can take regardless of whether you actually incurred any deductible expenses. For 2012 the standard deduction for single people is $5,950 and $11,900 for married couples. If all of your individual deductions - known as itemized deductions - do not add up to more than this number, you should take the standard deduction.;
