, When capturing B FLAG, there are two crucial points that you must control. The first one is the Mausoleum. Enemy players tend to camp in there and target flag takers. Capture this place and set bouncing betties in there. The second place you want to capture is the short tunnel opposite the Mausoleum. If you set betties there, you have successfully secured both flanks. The wooden bunker above the tunnel is also good to have.
, This is the Japanese side's last flag. When coming to the flag are, beware of snipers that are usually on the monuments on top of the hill. When capturing the flag, you want to secure the whole GROTTO; that means taking the whole curve.
 This is the Marine last flag. Again, be aware of snipers that are in the IMPERIAL BUNKER. Attack from the CREEK and the CRASH SITE to maximize your effectiveness.
