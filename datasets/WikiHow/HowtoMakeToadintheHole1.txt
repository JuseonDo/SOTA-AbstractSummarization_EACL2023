 Make sure that the baking rack is in the bottom third of the oven.;
, For a more traditional taste, omit the salt and pepper, and use some crumbled up beef bullion granules and mustard powder. Traditional toad in the hole uses fat drippings; the beef bouillon will give you a similar flavor., You can also mix the batter in a food processor or a blender to save some time., This will give the batter enough time to set. Covering the batter will also prevent it from becoming too dry., Pour the oil into a greased, medium-sized casserole dish, then roll the sausages around in it. Bake the sausages for 10 minutes, turn them over using a pair of tong, and bake them for another 10 minutes.The exact size of the casserole dish does not matter, but 8 by 10 inches (20.32 by 25.4 centimeters), 8 by 12 inches (20.32 by 30.48 centimeters), and 9 by 9 inches (22.86 by 22.86 centimeters) are all good sizes to start with.Use good quality pork or beef sausages. You can also use bangers, which are English sausages made from pork and breadcrumbs.,, Swirl it around to make sure that it coats the entire bottom of the pan. At this point, you can also sprinkle the batter with fresh rosemary and thyme leaves for extra flavor., Avoid opening the oven and peeking inside, or the batter will deflate and not rise properly.Instead, turn on the oven light and look through the window on the oven door. If the oven has no window, then simply wait 20 minutes.
, It tastes great served alongside some onion gravy and mashed potatoes.You can also serve it alongside steamed vegetables instead.
