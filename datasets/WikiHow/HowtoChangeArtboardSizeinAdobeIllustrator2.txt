 You can resize the artboard based on your art size directly in Illustrator using menu settings.
 If you have piece of created art that extends beyond your artboard, you can have Illustrator resize it automatically to fit correctly.
 This will display some additional options in a submenu.
 This will automatically resize the artboard so that it matches the dimensions of the artwork.
