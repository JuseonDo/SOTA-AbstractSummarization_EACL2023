 Zippy Chat is designed to work with all major browsers.;
, By default, most browsers ship with Javascript enabled. Zippy Chat requires Javascript to operate, so it is essential that it's enabled. Most browsers have this setting under a Security pane (Safari) or Content pane (Firefox, Chrome) within the browser's preferences.


, Your title should be relevant to the subject matter that will be discussed within the chat room, or to the visitors who will be visiting the chat room.
 This step is optional, but it can help search engines index your chat room and help visitors find your chat room.
 You're done. After clicking the button, you'll be redirected to your newly created chat room.
 The url for your chat room will never change, so share it to spread the word about your new chat room.
