 The people will cry out or reveal themselves after being hit with your non-lethal projectile weapon.;
, The best combination is from 2-4 people, more can be too many and less won't work quickly enough.
 The last thing you want is a parent or a guardian reporting your description to the police or neighborhood watch.
 Even if you are defacing a person's lawn or other property, don't be a jerk. No burning bags of dog feces, no smashing windows, and most f all do NOT harm your victim physically in any way, shape, or form. The idea is to have fun, not be a sadistic demon.
 Toilet paper, rotten pumpkin innards, smoke bombs, stink bombs, and eggs are allowed, as long as you don't go overboard or severely damage something. The worst thing is to get a reputation as a horrible prankster, you want to get a relationship of mutual respect between you and your victims, with a pinch of fear in their hearts.
 Use your imagination to think of other harmless but degrading pranks that can be done with relative ease.
 That's what Halloween is for!
