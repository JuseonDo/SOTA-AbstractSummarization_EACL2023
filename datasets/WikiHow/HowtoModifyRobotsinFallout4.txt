 This is the only DLC necessary to unlock what you need.;
, This is the minimum level required to activate the DLC.


A Quest will be added to your Pip-Boy, called Mechanical Menace. It will require you to listen to a caravan distress call on your Pip-Boy radio.
 You will find a group of robots attacking a lone blue robot.
 Once they are all destroyed, talk to the blue robot, ADA. ADA will request your assistance in avenging the murdered members of its caravan.
 Travel to any settlement, and in build mode, look under Specials.
 At this time, you will probably only have the bare minimum amount of supplies required to build robots, so your choices will be limited.
 You can use these mods to build your own robots.
 You will need scrap for the resources to build.
 Select a category, fill in the mod or part you want to build, and move on to the next. When it is fully customized to your liking, save it.
