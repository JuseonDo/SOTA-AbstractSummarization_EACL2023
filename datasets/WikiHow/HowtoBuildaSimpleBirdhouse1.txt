 Cut out 7-9 6x6 pieces of wood, measuring 2cm-5cm thick and thin, depending on your intended size. These form the 4 walls, the 1 floor and the 2 roof pieces.;
, Depending on the bird you're hoping to encourage to stay, the circle should be of the size it can adequately fit into. Once drawn, cut out the circle using a suitable saw.
 Using wood glue would be easiest but if you can nail it together, then that is preferable, as it will be more durable.
 The square with the hole in it should be at the front of the house.
 Nail the roof on to ensure that it is absolutely secure. Be sure to secure it so that the rain can't get inside.
 Use waterproof paint, so that it will last for a long time. Be sure to check that it is not toxic to the birds though.
 If you want birds to find it, place it somewhere visible, such as on your porch, out in a tree, or simply just sitting on a bench.
