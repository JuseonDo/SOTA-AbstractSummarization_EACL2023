Place your small wooden box at this intersection., Press the corner edges together. Smooth any excess glue with a cloth.,, Spread a ribbon of glue over each set of holes and connect the corner pieces. Screw in each corner with 3 screws., Experiment with the height of the shelves until you are sure it will fit your books, photo frames or other items.
