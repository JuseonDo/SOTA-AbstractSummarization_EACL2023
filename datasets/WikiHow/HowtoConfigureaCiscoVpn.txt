 Before you can begin configuration, the Cisco VPN Client must be installed if it is not already on your computer.;
, To properly configure the Cisco VPN on your computer, you will need the hostname or IP address of the remote VPN server you will be accessing, as well as the name of the IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) group you are assigned to by the system administrator. You will also need the IPSec password for that same group and the username and password you normally use to sign in and access that same server locally.
 The default location will normally be in the Programs section of your Start menu on a Windows computer.
 When the main dialog box of the Cisco VPN Client appears on the screen, click on the "New" button in the middle of the window. This will open the New Connection Entry Wizard.
 Although it is optional, you may also enter a description of the new connection entry in the field below. Click on the "Next" button to proceed.
, Next to the "Name" field, type in the name of the IPSec group you are assigned to. Next to the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields, type in your IPSec group password. Both the name and password fields are case-sensitive. This screen also gives you the option to choose the name of a certificate if you have any installed on your computer. Click on the "Next" button to proceed.
 Your new connection entry will now appear in the Connection Entry drop-down box on the main dialog window of the Cisco VPN Client.
