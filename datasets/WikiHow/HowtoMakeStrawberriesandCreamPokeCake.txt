 Use the original directions or instructions according to the recipe of your choice. Set the cake aside to cool completely.;
, Use the round tip at the end of a wooden spoon to create evenly portioned holes throughout the entire cake.
 Combine the Jello and boiling water in a medium bowl and stir to dissolve the Jello. Add the cold water and continue to stir. Pour the mixture over the cake.
 Use plastic wrap to cover the cake and place it in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours. This allows the Jello to absorb and solidify into the cake.
 Combine the powdered sugar, whipped cream, cream cheese, and vanilla in a large bowl. Use a rubber spatula to distribute the frosting evenly on the cake. Distribute the diced strawberries evenly around the cake.
