 2. Before anything else, you must know where your opponent is. Mushroom no. 2 can be found within Christmas Town in the Nightmare Before Christmas world (Jack's world).


You can find the mushroom by going through the path at the right side of the carousel in front of Sandy Claw's house.;
, You must have this in order to finish Mushroom no. 2's challenge.
 This is also a necessity, although you can just spam Reflega if you're bad at guarding.
 Mushroom no.2's challenge is for you to reflect all it's magic back to it and and hit it at least 80 times.
 Then jump and press □, but don't use the analog stick. This will cause Sora to glide in place and use absolute guard.
 All the magic attacks directed at you will be deflected by Sora's keyblades.


Remember to adjust your position if the mushroom gets behind you; Sora's keyblades will only protect attacks from the front, so your side and back are wide open.
 Absolute guard won't be able to block this due to it being a multi-direction attack. Reflega will be able to block it and send all of it back to the mushroom.
 It will cause you to fall when you use it.


Remember to face the mushroom, or the keyblades won't be able to protect you.
 It won't be hard as the keyblades will do most of the work for you.
