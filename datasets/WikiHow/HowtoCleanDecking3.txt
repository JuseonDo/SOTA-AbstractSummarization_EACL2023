 Rent a pressure washer from a local tool rental shop, or buy a pressure washer if you will use it often. Get one that has less than 1500 PSI, since anything stronger can destroy the deck.
 Use either oxygen bleach or a cleaner specifically for a pressure washer. Read the instructions on the container of cleaning solution to determine how much cleaning product to put in the pressure washer.
 Keeping the nozzle at this distance can avoid damaging the surface while cleaning the deck.
 Empty the cleaning solution out of the pressure washer, and then add clean water.
