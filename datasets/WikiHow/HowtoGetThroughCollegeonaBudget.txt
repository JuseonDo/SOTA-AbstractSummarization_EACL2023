prioritize your needs on a time scale as well, know when you're going to have the most money out of the month, or know when you're going to have to set aside a few extra dollars for that winter coat you really need.

 A quick, concise list won't cut it, factor in EVERY imaginable expense from laundry detergent, to oil changes on your car. A thorough list might include cleaning products, food, tuition, books, office-type supplies, phone bill, rent, entertainment, utilities, laundry, transportation costs, clothes, make-up, internet, hair cuts and of course the list goes on. Make sure you don't neglect anything!;
, Some easy ones are cable television, expensive cell phone packages, nights out at the bar, take out food, clothes etc. Prioritise, ask your self "what are the bare bone essentials?"

, Prioritize your needs- of course food and rent should come before beers and take-out.
