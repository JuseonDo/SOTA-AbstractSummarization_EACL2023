 If you have the money, go to a salon and have a professional give you some ideas. If something seems too "out there", don't let him/her pressure you into doing it. Choose an option that you feel comfortable with., It's easiest to just work with your hair. If you want more body just blow-dry your hair after you get out of the shower or use a volumizing shampoo. But if you're gonna blow-dry your hair be sure and use some anti-frizz serum. Then go over the parts you want straighter with a straightener., While your hair is still wet put some mousse or gel in your palm and scrunch up your hair with your hands. Then you may want to put on a little hairspray.
