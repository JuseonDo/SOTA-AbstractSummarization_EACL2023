 In old times (and still in some places today), parents feel ashamed to give birth to a girl. Girls deserve respect from society, and all good Muslims should provide them with a better future.;
, Ask for her opinions and feelings about things, and listen genuinely to her responses. Recognize that she is intelligent, and deserves an equal position when making decisions.
 Treat her with respect and protect her reputation and sense of safety. Never catcall her, or make sexual remarks about her in public.


Remember that people change as they grow, and they don’t forget how you have treated them.
Never forget that your reputation as a gentleman is part of your character. You build it as you grow. Make yourself proud.
 She deserves equal legal and civil rights as men have, she deserves affection, respect & love . The women is a mother, a lovely wife & a princess of her father, a daughter.
