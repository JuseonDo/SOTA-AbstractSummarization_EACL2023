, Make sure the glass is cold beforehand, so the salt sticks to it.
 Gently, but firmly, press the rim into the salt, turning the glass so the salt builds up on the rim. Try to do this as evenly as possible for presentation's sake.









If you don't have a salt try, grab a small plate. You don't have to throw out the salt if you're concerned about waste.
 Though the glass is cold and the beer can be drank without ice, it adds life to your drink and makes the taste crisper and cleaner.
 If you don't have a hand-juicer, go mano-a-mano with the limes and squeeze as much juice as you can over the ice, watching for seeds that pop out.
 Don't go overboard -- these additions are pretty powerful. If you have a more delicate palate, you'll want to go light on the Tabasco sauce -- even a couple of drops can be quite the kicker.
 Any of the better Mexican varieties are the best for this cocktail. Traditionally, with this version, you'll want a light beer, like Corona.
 Or you'll get one mouthful of beer and one mouthful of Tabasco and lime -- not a pretty sight!
