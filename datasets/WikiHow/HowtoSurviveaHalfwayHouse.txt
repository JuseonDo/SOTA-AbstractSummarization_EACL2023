 Start on a good note, be positive, don't be down about it, you can always gain something from every experience in life.;
, There will undoubtedly be people who are being "forced" to be there, and who will not be there to work towards good goals, or sobriety. They will simply drag you down.
 Actively participate in YOUR recovery. Talk to the people who ARE working on their sobriety, they will be able to help you on your journey towards recovery. In places such as treatment centers and halfway houses, other people are KEY, instrumental for your recovery. The power of people helping people is the key/foundation on which sobriety can be built. No one knows an alcoholic/addict like a fellow one.
 It will only end up hurting your recovery! You will either end up in a correctional facility (Jail, prison, state mental hospital, or a more secure facility) or even worse back out on the streets using, and causing more damage to your life.
 Any damaged relationships can begin to be mended while you are there, simply being there is showing that you are putting effort into yourself.
 You and your sobriety are key! Without your sobriety you simply cannot be YOU!

, Keep a journal for you to look back on, so you can see how far you have come. It takes constant effort. But it does get easier you do adjust to your new life.
 Build a sober social network, make sober friends, get in the habit of going to meetings. Gain practice at living sober, it took you many years of practicing drinking/drudging to get to the place your are, so consistent use of the tools you have gained is vital!

,, Not only will this give you more money, but you'll find more sanity working all the time than staying in the halfway house.
