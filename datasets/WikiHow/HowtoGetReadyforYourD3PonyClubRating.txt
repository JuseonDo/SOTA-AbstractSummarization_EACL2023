 This the hardest part of it all. Luckily, at this level, it is not too bad. Try printing out just the HM test sheet, filling in the correct answers, and having someone ask you them.

When you can get all of the answers 10 times correctly, you are ready. If you have any questions, e-mail or text a friend a level or two up, or talk to your DC. They are there to help you. Do not be worried, and remember that it is easier to remember if you are relaxed.;
, These are what will lose you the most points, so be very particular and specific. When you have more information available, you will look much more prepared!

Go through a last minute check before you go, to make sure you did not leave out any important information.
 The best way to wow the examiner is to simply talk to them. If your horse drifted, tell them. If you dropped your stirrup, tell them. They want to know that you know what is going well and what is not, and that is the best way to pass., For example, the amount of food your horse gets, or to look up over the fence. This will really help you to do well, but you should know everything before you leave the house., They want to know your opinion, too!
