 Make sure all work surfaces are clean and any kitchen utensils are washed.;
, You need to make sure that you have everything you need before you start.
, Make sure the slices are a nice even size. Most people like thin slices but this is up to personal preference.
, Remember to spread it around evenly. Use as much or as little as you like.
