 Pre-packaged curriculum offer all of the necessary subjects, but some materials may require more lesson planning and preparation than other materials.;
, There are a number of curriculum that cater to the visual learner, the auditory learner, those that prefer computer lessons, hands-on learners, and those that like to learn by reading and writing. Once you know your child's learning style, look for a curriculum that caters to the particular style.
 Some companies offer both an online and print catalog, while others have switched to an online only catalog. Browse all of the catalogs for a few days and see which ones offer the style and price you need.
 Many home education companies attend these conventions, where families can view the materials, ask questions, and even take home some samples. Most publishers also offer convention discounts if you order at the convention. Look on the publishers' websites for a convention schedule.
 Online auction sites, email groups and swap sites usually offer home education materials at a reduced rate.


There are also some local homeschooling conventions that allow homeschoolers to sell and buy used (and sometimes new) books for a discount.
 These often have discount specials or member-only discounts that can help reduce the overall cost of the curriculum.


You can also sign up for multiple educational publishers if you decide to go with multiple company's curriculums.
 Some home-school companies offer pre-packaged curriculum that run well over $1,000. To help alleviate costs, some publishers offer interest-free financing or monthly payment options to help homeschoolers with a tight budget.
 Some secondary sources offer cheaper products but charge more for shipping.
 Most educational publishers have a knowledgeable staff that can answer your questions about the curriculum or help you with proper placement for your child before you make a purchase.
