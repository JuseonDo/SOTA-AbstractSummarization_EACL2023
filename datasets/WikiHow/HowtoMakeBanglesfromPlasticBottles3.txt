 Allow a small overlap as well as the size of the bangle, to allow you to wrap it over onto the outer side.
 The join should meet in the middle of the outside of the bangle. This join will shortly be covered up by the beads.
 This width should be less than the width of the bangle, so that you can see the foil tape either side of it when applied to the bangle.
 Be sure to cover the join from the foil tape. Leave the upper backing on the double-sided tape until you're ready to add the micro beads.
 This will keep them in place and provides a place for you to roll the bangle.
 Roll the bangle slowly in the container of beads, pressing gently to pick up the micro beads on the double sided tape.


Hold the bangle by the edges as you do this.
 This will hold them in place. As you do this, press more micro beads into place where there are gaps, using the sealant to keep them intact.
 Adjust any areas which seem to be missing micro beads if needed, using the sealant as adhesive.
 When dry, check for any loose beads and fix as needed.
 The beaded foil bangle is now ready for wearing.
