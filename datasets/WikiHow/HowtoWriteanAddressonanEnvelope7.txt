Include any necessary titles. You can probably skip titles for close friends and family members, but you might consider including them for government officials, military personnel, doctors, professors or elderly people.
 This is especially relevant in rural areas where houses or estates are known by name instead of by address.
 For example, you might write "Neuschwansteinstra√üe 20."

, For example, "87645 Schwangau."

, If you're mailing between countries, include the name of the country on the last line.
