 You can also add some color with a drop or two of liquid watercolor, liquid food coloring, or gel food coloring.You may be able to use white school glue for this method too. You will need to add in about 1 teaspoon of glitter into it. If you want it to be colorful, add in a few drops of liquid watercolor, liquid food coloring, or gel food coloring.;
,, Keep stirring until the glue and water (if using) are evenly combined.Do not add the liquid starch just yet. It is important to mix your base ingredients first. If you just dump everything into the bowl all at once, your slime won't come together properly., Start with just ½ cup (120 milliliters) of liquid starch. Stir it in with a spoon first, then knead it in with your hands. At some point, the slime will ball together, and leave behind liquid starch in the bowl. At this point, you can scoop the slime out of the bowl, and discard the excess starch.

If the slime isn't stretchy enough for you, add some more liquid starch, and knead it in., Slime is fun to play with for children of all ages. It is also perfect for sensory play activities for young children. Once playtime is over, put it away into an airtight container, and keep it in an cool, dry place.
