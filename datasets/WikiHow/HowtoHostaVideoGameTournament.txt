, Here are some things a game must include for it to be "tournament approved":


A fun multiplayer mode, with scores ("kills" and "deaths" are acceptable).
Preferably a 4 player multiplayer, 2 & 3 player is okay only if you have about 5-6 people, any more and you want 4 player.
It must have excitement and have a theme or subject everyone understands.
The matches, races, songs, games, or whatever you play in the game must not drag on forever! People lose interest after a while.
, At this time you should also organize the tournament, whether you randomize or strategize the matches, get it all together.
 Show them where the snacks are and if they have any stuff take it for them and put it in a room you won't be using, this will be your room for guests' coats and items. Sit down with them and chat calmly, this way it is easy to leave and greet incoming guests without being rude.
 Explain how it is going to work and make sure each individual fully understands the process. If you are randomly organizing (such as drawing out of a hat) get that done at this time.
