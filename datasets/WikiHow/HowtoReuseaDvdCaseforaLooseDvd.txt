 Some DVD stores sell these. You can also find them on eBay.


If there is a cover to the case, flip it around. You should now have a DVD case with a white cover.;
, If you want to stick to the basics, just write the title of the movie/video game on the border and the cover. You could also print out the cover of the movie/video game and put it on the front. Then, you could type the name of the movie for the border. If you want to get really fancy, if you know the copyright, type the copyright stuff, print it out, and put it in the back of the case.
 You should now have an awesome looking case.
