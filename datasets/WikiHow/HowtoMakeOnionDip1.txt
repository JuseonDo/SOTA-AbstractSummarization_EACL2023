 You can use nonfat, low fat, or regular.;
, If you can't find fresh parsley, use 1 teaspoon (15 grams) dried parsley instead.
 Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl every so often, so that the plain sour cream doesn't settle at the bottom.
 You can dip the tip of a spoon into it, or you can taste it with a potato chip.
 This will give the dried onion to absorb moisture from the sour cream and soften. It will also give the herbs and seasonings enough time to release their flavors into the sour cream.
 The dip will last in the fridge for 5 to 7 days.
