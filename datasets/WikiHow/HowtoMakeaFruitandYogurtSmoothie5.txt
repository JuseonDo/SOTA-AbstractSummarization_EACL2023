 You'll need a box of strawberries, some banana (optional), a container of plain vanilla yogurt, vanilla extract, and a box of blueberries.
 Make medium-sized slices of the strawberries and/or bananas. Cut off the leaves of the strawberries. It doesn't really matter if the slices are uneven, because they will blend together in the blender.
, Add it to the blender. About 10 to 15 tablespoonfuls is a good amount.
 Put it into the blender.
 For example, a little granola or a handful of nuts.
 Let it mix for about 20 seconds, or until the mixture is pinkish with little flecks of dark in it.
 Enjoy!
