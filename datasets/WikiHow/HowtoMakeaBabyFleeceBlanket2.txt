 They can both be the same color, or they can be two different colors. You can even use a solid color for one piece, and a pattern for the other. Your finished blanket will measure 36 by 36 inches (91.44 by 91.44 centimeters) with a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) fringe on all four sides.
 Try to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time. This will ensure that all of your edges match up.If you are using patterned fleece, make sure that the right side is facing out.
 Once again, be sure to cut through both layers of fleece at the same time.,, Starting from the bottom left corner, take the first tassel from the top and bottom pieces of fleece. Holding them together, push them through the 1/4-inch (0.64-centimeter) slit you made.Gently tug on the tassels to tighten them.
 This blanket is similar to the traditional tied, no-sew blanket, but because you are not tying the tassels together, you won't get as much bulk.
