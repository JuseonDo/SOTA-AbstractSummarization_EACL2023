 The two shapes should overlap in the lower part of the circle. These will serve as Mushu's head and jaw.


Sketch a few guidelines if you want, but they're not really necessary for this particular drawing.;
, Add two parallel diagonal lines connecting to the left part of the jaw. These shapes will be the ears and neck.
 Put in two protruding eyes with small ovals for the irises, a snout with a large nose, and a smiling open mouth.
 Shape the upper lip to look like a mustache, with irregular pointy teeth and a tongue inside the mouth, nostrils for the nose, and two thin, wavy mustaches next both sides of the nose. Blacken the irises and add light spots for shine.
 Try to draw a modulate line--a line is both thick and thin at different places. This will make your drawing look much better.
 Look at the illustration for reference.
