 The blossom end has the small brown circle on it. The end has an enzyme that can make your pickles softer, and a bit more soggy, which inhibits the pickling process., Mix in ten 5–6 inch (12.7–15.2 cm) pickling cucumbers, 2 cups of water, 1 3/4 cups of white vinegar, 1 1/2 cups of chopped fresh dill, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 8 cloves of chopped garlic, 1 1/2 tbsp. of coarse salt, 1 tbsp. of pickling spice, 1 1/2 tsp. of dill seed, and 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes., Stir thoroughly to combine the ingredients.
 This will be long enough for the salt and sugar to dissolve.
 Distribute them as evenly as you can -- three pickles in two jars, and four pickles in the third.
 The pickles should be completely submerged in the liquid.
 This will add even more of a dill flavor to the pickles.
 Make sure to seal them tightly.
 These pickles should be refrigerated for at least 10 days before you eat them. After that, they will last one month.
 Enjoy these simple dill pickles as a side with your next sandwich.
