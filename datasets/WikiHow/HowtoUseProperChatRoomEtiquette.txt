, Simply asking for help, saying you need help, or telling the room you have a question will not turn attention towards you. People are not mind readers, and they cannot help you unless you ask for it. Be specific in what you are looking for, and provide all relevant details to your question.
 This is important in any situation, but even more so in a chat room, because only text is seen, and you can not see facial expressions or hear tones of voice.
 Patience is a virtue.
, mIRC users will be able to see them, but the more hardcore irc users will see nothing but garbage. Often, IRC channels have a mode that will prevent your message from being displayed if it contains color codes.
 It is hard on the eyes to read and considered rude. It is the Internet equivalent to shouting. If you want to call attention to a particular word or phrase, Do so in the same manner that you would in conversation. Just ask, and see who answers.
 ASL is the common greeting and asking for a persons age/sex/location. Considered rude and unnecessary in most chat rooms, often you will give the impression that you are either ignorant or have no real reason to be there. If you want to know something about a person, stick around a while and find out. People are more willing to reveal such personal details about themselves once they get to know you and feel more comfortable around you. You wouldn't instantly walk up to a person in a bar and ask them for their age, or where they live, so don't do it in chat. Or, read their profile.
 It is an invasion of privacy to assume that you can open an instant message window with someone you do not know.
