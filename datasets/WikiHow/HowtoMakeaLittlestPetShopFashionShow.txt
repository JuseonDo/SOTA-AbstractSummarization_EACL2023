 Other LPS will be needed for judging and to be in the audience.;
, Any other doll clothes that will fit can be used too, along with any clothing you've made yourself.


Select the clothes that will be modeled on the catwalk.
 A shoebox is ideal but any other box of similar shape and length will work too.
 This can be as easy as covering it with nice paper or you might paint it all one color (like white, black or pink). If wished, add logos, patterns and names as well.
,, This is optional but fun; arrange the clothes on a "table" or flat surface for the LPS to change near.


Another cardboard box could be used to make the dressing room; turn it over on its side and face the back of it to the stage. Cover the back with the same paper or paint as the stage, so that it appears seamless. Inside, hang or fold clothes and treat this as the changing area.
 This could be doll chairs, blocks, boxes, plastic containers or anything that can serve as seating.
 Some ideas include:


Position a desk lamp so that it shines over the catwalk.
Place up pictures of famous models.
Include refreshments for audience and judges; the models should have some in the changing area. Choose 1-2 LPS or other dolls to serve the refreshments.
Add brushes and combs, mirrors, perfume, shampoo, dressing tables, etc. to the changing area.
 Use a portable music player to play music in the background.
 Build up to the showing the best clothes last. If you are really keen, make flyers setting out the agenda for the audience and judges.
 Seat the audience in their places.
 Play the music, if using.
 Parade the models, change them and complete the show.


You might like to have a "host" LPS who explains the outfits to everyone.
 Select a winning outfit.
