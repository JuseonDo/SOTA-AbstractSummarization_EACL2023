 Good show preparation starts the day before, and good preparation is absolutely essential for success!Firstly, make sure that all tack is cleaned to perfection and give the horse a bath. Next, prepare all equipment such as the rider's clothing and check that you have everything that is needed - now is the time to go and buy last minute items.Also , make sure that your lorry /trailer is ready for the next day to avoid any unwanted delays.;
,, this will allow for unexpected difficulties with loading/plaiting etc. Plait the horse if necessary .
 Once you have arrived at the showground (with a lot of time to spare, of course), give your horse a chance to get used to the surroundings.
, Only overtake if it is essential and make sure your horse wears a red ribbon if he kicks.
, You will then be pulled into the middle of the ring and invited to do your individual show. This should include all four gaits and is best to be kept short and simple. It should show the judge that the horse responds perfectly to his rider.Please note that in some classes , the ride judge will ride the horse, not you.Always finish with a square halt and salute the judge.
 The judge will then get the class walking around the outside again and will then pick the winner. Placed horses will then get pulled up and a rosette will be given.


Non winners will leave the ring.
 A lap of honour will then take place in a controlled canter.
