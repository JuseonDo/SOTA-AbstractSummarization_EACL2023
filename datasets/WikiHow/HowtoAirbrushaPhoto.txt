 Locate the application your computer and double click to open.;
, Go to the "File" menu and click "Open." Find and select the photo you want to edit. It’s best to select a photo with high resolution since you’re dealing with fine details. A 10-megapixel image should suffice.
 Select a portion of the photo with skin.
 You will now have two layers.
, Do this by selecting the "High Pass" layer and clicking on the eye icon to the left of the layer.
 Select "Filter" then "Blur" from the menu.
 First, choose "Surface Blur." Then adjust in a way that the image becomes blurry but still recognizable.
 When you’re done, adjust the radius so the skin becomes smooth.
 Click on the eye icon in the left to reveal this layer.
 Do this by clicking the drop-down menu above your layer list and choosing the option.
 For a natural look, you will need to reduce the visibility of bumps on the darker skin-toned sides of the skin. To simulate this effect, add a layer mask by going to Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal All.
 Apply a copy of the image on the mask.
, Select "High Pass" filter. You can find this option by expanding the "Filter" menu then "Other."

, It’s best to adjust in tiny increments.
 This is located in the layers palette.
 Head to Image > Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast. Increase the contrast and adjust the brightness to the bumps on the skin.


The bumps are less visible on darker areas and more visible in bright areas.
 Press Ctrl + G.
 Go to Layers > Layer Mask > Hide All.
 Add it above the "High Pass" layer.
 Change the opacity of the layer to 50%.
 Do this by clicking the black thumbnail in the layers palette.
 This will make the smooth skin effect visible over areas you paint.
 Just right-click anywhere on the canvas and select a large-diameter brush with 50 hardness.
 Fill the tiny spots with a smaller brush. Precision isn’t too required here, as small flaws aren’t noticeable

, Done!
