 Gone are the days of art being prohibitively expensive. There are now a number of art fairs and exhibitions that advocate affordable art. The definition of "affordable" varies from person to person, of course, and as such, even at affordable art fairs you will see some pieces with eye-wateringly high prices. Which is why you use art fairs as research opportunities, and then contact artists directly.
 See if you can find anything that sounds like it might specialise in reasonably-priced art.
 Often artists will have their own separate contact information and websites, allowing you to contact them directly and avoid gallery price mark-ups.
 More often than not, when you do this you'll find alternative colourings of popular prints of their own stores, along with leftover prints from limited runs - giving you more reasonably priced, limited-run prints to adorn your walls with.
 If you have a specific idea of what you would like the artist to produce for you, you can even commission them to make it for you - a truly one-of-a-kind and (hopefully) extraordinary piece!
