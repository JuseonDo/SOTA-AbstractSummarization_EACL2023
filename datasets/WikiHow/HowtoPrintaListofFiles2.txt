In Windows Vista or Windows 7, type Command Prompt or Cmd in the Start Menu search box and press "Enter."
In Windows â€‹XP, you will find the Command Prompt application in the Accessories section of the programs listed under your Start Menu.



For instance, if you want a full list of files from your Documents folder, you would follow "dir /a" with "C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\," keeping the quotation marks for this part of the command only.



For instance, to save the file on your desktop in Windows Vista, you would type ">C:\users\yourusername\desktop\dirlist.txt" without the quotation marks in the command prompt.



You have just created a .txt file named "dirlist" located on your desktop. Double-clicking this file will open it in Word, Notepad or some other text-editing program where it can easily be formatted and printed.
