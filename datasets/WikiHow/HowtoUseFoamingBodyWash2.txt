 Squeeze a small amount in the center of your palm and wait for it to foam., Once your body wash is foaming, you can rub it into your skin. Due to its foamy nature, body wash can be applied with your hands instead of a wash cloth or other device. Wash your skin wherever you normally would with body wash.While you can use a wash cloth or sponge with foaming body wash, these can contain bacteria. Part of the appeal of foaming body wash is that you can apply it simply using your hands to reduce germs.
 When you're done applying your body wash, rinse off as you normally would. You can finish your shower routine as normal after using foaming body wash.
 You do not want to rub your skin dry after using a moisturizing body wash. This can irritate your skin, cutting back on the body wash's soothing effects. Instead, gently dab your skin dry using a towel after getting out of the bath or shower.
