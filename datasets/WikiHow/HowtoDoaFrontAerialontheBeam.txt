 It's safer if you stretch for at least 10 to 15 minutes, before attempting difficult skills.;
, A couple of prerequisites, (things you need to be able to do first) are a front walkover on the beam/line. Also, you'll need to be comfortable doing a front aerial, on the floor and line first. This will make it less likely to hurt yourself seriously.
 Most gymnasts at this level are already comfortable with the beam, but others may still have some fear doing harder tricks, and flips. Here are some tips to get comfortable with the beam:


Practice walking on it forwards, backwards, sideways, and in releve.
Practice jumps and turns, like half and full turns, and split jumps/leaps.
Practice easier skills like cartwheels, handstands, and back walkovers.
 The first time you do a front aerial on the beam, wide or thin, it must be with a spot. This is not a cartwheel, or a forward roll––it's an aerial, which is no-handed, requiring extra precaution.
, This means placing your bad leg forwards.
