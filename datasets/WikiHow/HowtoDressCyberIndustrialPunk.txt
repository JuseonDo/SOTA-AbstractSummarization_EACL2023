learn as much as you can about the style, then, armed with your trusty purse go out into the shopping world.

@summary
some ideas: boys: bondage pants or wide-leg pants, plaid design clothing, black band t-shirts (rammstein or kmfdm tend to be popular in the us); military jackets; combat boots and never forget goggles.

@summary

@summary
try going to some clubs or events.

@summary

 Like any other style: Don't rush in or people may think badly of you, and you'll look like a poser or worse, a clown. It also gives you time to sort out and think how you want your wardrobe to look and how it will all mix and match.;
, No place is safe and cyber/industrial items can be found anywhere! Try thrift stores especially, then stores such as Walmart. You can find a lot of things at Home Depot as well! If nothing works go only and shop for bargain.
 Girls: mini skirts or pencil skirts, leopard print tops, pvc clothing, platform boots (and goggles). All of these can also work for either sex, believe it or not skirts are not just for transgender people, though it thoroughly depends on who you hang out with.
 There are a few types of cyber genres known as EBM, Industrial, IDM, Bass, Rave, and Trance. A few good bands are Atari Teenage Riot, Wumpscut, Front Line Assembly, Funker VOGT, Rammstein, KMFDM, Front 242, Angelspit, Neuroticfish, Apoptygma Berzerk, God Module, Grendel, and Combichrist. (Try side projects!)

, There are definitely going to be people there dressed like you and who love the same stuff as you do. Remember, people who dress like this are just as good as people who don't. They are like you and have cool interests too. Try to find some friends with similar interests!

, You can wear wigs or dye your hair crazy colors such as orange, purple, blue, or even pink. There are extensions too for people with short hair called "hairfall." These include foam, wool, and ribbon and usually are made of synthetic dreads. Some even have goggles on their head, usually painted black, have skulls, paint splats, bio hazard symbols or one solid color on them. Some have cyberlox (hair falls made out of slinky type material), very popular, and you'll look great. They're expensive though, so if cost is an issue make your own out of hollow tubes and electrical pvc tape. Shaving hair is optional, however you may confused for a skinhead, which is NOT a good thing.
