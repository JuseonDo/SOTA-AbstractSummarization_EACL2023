Usually, the hockey goal half circle can be used in most ice rinks.
Only if the ice arena allows it, you may be able to draw a half circle on the ice instead.
 Generally, when learning the basics, all steps start in T-position. This is a position that allows feet to be in the correct direction.


For a right inside edge, place the heel of your right blade towards the middle of your left blade.



It is very important not to look down because that can cause you to lose your balance.



Your arms should be parallel to the ice.



Make sure that you push your foot back with enough force to give you speed
Without proper speed, you will not be able to finish the edge across the entire the half circle

, This indicates leaning to the left side of right blade.


Make sure to continue to keep your arms in place as mentioned above as they will direct movement on the ice.

If you look in the direction of your forward arm, it will help direct your movement.
This will allow completion of the half circle turn.
