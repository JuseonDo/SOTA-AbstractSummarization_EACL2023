, Once you have become familiar with the recipe, you can make changes as your tastes change.



At this point, you can add the onions in with the food while it is cooking, or leave them on the side to add to your plate while eating. This meal is entirely driven by your own tastes.
 Depending on how much you have added to the bread, there may be more stuffing than room. If so, just wrap it up in a bit of aluminum foil and heat it with the rest of the bread.



Crispy Crust - put the stuffed french bread on a cookie sheet and let it sit in the oven for a few minutes while everything warms up together.






Soft Crust - butter the crust, wrap in aluminum foil and heat in the oven until the crust has warmed up. About 10 minutes or so.
