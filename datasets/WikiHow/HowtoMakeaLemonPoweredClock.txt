, Although this step is optional, it's a good idea.
, Find the farthest spot away from the nail and push a copper wire into it. What you're doing now is creating a closed circuit, so energy can flow from the lemon and back again.
 Depending on your clock, there are two AA batteries or one cell battery.
 You'll be replacing its energy with the lemon, nail and copper connection you just created.
 This is easier said than done. If you can't connect your wire to the positive point in the battery compartment, you should remove the plastic backing and open up the clock. An adult should help you with this, and the clock may not go back together.
 You'll see the positive and negative points are connected to wires on the inside of the clock. Remove the wires from the back of the battery compartment and then use them to make your connections.


If you have a two-AA battery clock and inside you find two positive wires, make sure you un-connect your copper wire with both.
 You may need to move the lemon into a new position so you can clip the nail to the clock.
