 If you have only just installed Windows Genuine Advantage notifications, simply using the system restore function will remove the program. Then refuse to accept the WGA update next time Windows updates. Otherwise, proceed as detailed below.
 Click on Start, then Run. Type CMD and press OK.
 Type "cd \windows\system32" (without quotation marks).
 Type the following lines:
taskkill -IM wgatray.exe
del wgatray.exe
del wgalogon.old

,, This should kill the wgatray.exe process from the Taskbar and immediately delete both files wgatray.exe and wgalogon.dll.
