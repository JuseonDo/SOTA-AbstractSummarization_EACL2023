@summary
lay your bicycle down so that the side of one handlebar rests over the sheet of paper on the floor.

@summary
remove your bike and refine the tracing, smoothing out edges and adding more seam allowance.

@summary
place your pattern piece over the fabric and pin it in place.

@summary
if you have side mounted brake lines such as shimano ultegra or 105's, you will need to draw a line from your brake hoods back to your handle bar.

@summary
pin the two sides of each mitt together.

@summary
sew the two sides together along the top and bottom edges.finish the seams you just sewed by either zigzagging over the raw edges or by sewing bias tape to cover the raw edges to prevent fraying.

@summary
finish the pointed, narrow end in the same manner as above, taking care to leave enough room for that end to slide up and over the ends of your handlebars.

@summary
turn the mitts "right side out" so that the seam allowances are to the inside.

@summary
pin the hook and loop (aka "velcro") strips to the edges of your brake line slit and bottom handle bar opening to form closures.

@summary
place the mitts on your drop bars and enjoy warmer hands on your next cold ride!

,  Trace the handlebar shape onto the sheet of paper.  Add approximately 1/2 an inch all around to allow for seam widths.  Add another 5 inch "wedge from the top point of the handlebar brake "hoods" back toward the wrist.
  (You can always sew it smaller later on... but if you cut the pieces too small, you cannot enlarge them at a later point.)  Take care to add around an inch extra to the seam allowance by the narrow, bar ends.  This opening must be able to slide over the ends of your handlebars later on.
  You will need to cut four of this shape from your quilted material.,  This will be where you will cut a slit to accommodate your brake lines.

If you cut a slit for your brake lines, you will need to finish the edges of that slit before you continue with the mitts.  Sew your bias tape over the edges of the slit or roll the edges under and away from the open edge to prevent fraying.
Note the cut line in the "template" or "trial version" on the left. This was placed on the handlebars and cut "in situ" to find the correct placement of the brake line slit.
  You should have two, opposite, mitts.  Double check this while pinning so that you don't inadvertently end up with two right handle mitts and no left mitt or vice versa.,  (marked with red lines in the picture) You will need to leave two openings.  One for the hands and one for the handle bar end. (small, pointed end.) Note in this picture, the slit for the brake lines has already been finished.
,  (These should fit loosely.  If they are tight, you will need to unpick some of the seams to enlarge the opening to allow them to slide over smoothly.),  Finish the edges of the hand openings by sewing a strip of double fold bias tape over the edges.,  Stitch them in place.
