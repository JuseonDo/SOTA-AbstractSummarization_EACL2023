 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need". In terms of which oil to choose, bear in mind that the oil has to be strong in fragrance to overcome the natural scent of the ink. Suitable oils include:


Essential oils: Patchouli, frankincense, lemongrass and cypress






Synthetic scented or fragrance oils: Carnation, violet, magnolia, rose.





;
,, Add 100 drops of the chosen oil. Mix. This step is important because unless the oil and vodka are mixed prior to addition to the ink, they won't blend.
 Stir to combine as you add.
 Use the funnel to assist the pouring.
 Should the ink and alcohol/oil mix separate during storage, always resort to shaking to recombine.
