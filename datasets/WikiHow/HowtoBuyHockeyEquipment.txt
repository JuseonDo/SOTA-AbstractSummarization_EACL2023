, See what they think on how your shoulder pads fit. They may not be accurate, but it doesn't hurt to ask. You'll get the best results if you go to a hockey-centered store, instead of a big chain store, such as Modell's, or Sports Authority.
 The equipment may feel rather comfortable at first, but end up not fitting you.
 Buying used skates is fine, as long as the store has a skate oven. The cost of a set of new skates is sometimes worth it, but if you find a good quality pair of used skates that you can get molded, buy them. Both function just fine.
