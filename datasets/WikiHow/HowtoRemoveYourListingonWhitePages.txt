 This is the only way to remove your listing. You are claiming your listing, so they want the registered member to have some way to manage it and what best way yet than to have someone who knows the most about themselves and can change this setting at will. There is a Join and/or Log In buttons in the top right corner of all Whitepages sites. Fill in the required data and click the Login button to continue.;
, Make sure to use your full name and exact city and state for these boxes.
 Find the user that most represents your name and address - not just someone you know living at your address.
 You'll need this complete address later.
