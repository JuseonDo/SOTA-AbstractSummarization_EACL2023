 You can buy special holographic or "spectrum" foil meant for nail art online or in a well-stocked beauty supply shop. You can also buy some holographic cellophane from any store that sells gift wrap., You can use any color you want. If you are new to the realm of nail art, consider choosing silver as your base color. This way, if your foil rips or tears while you are applying it, the gaps won't be as visible.Do not apply a top coat just yet.
 They don't have to be perfect, but try to get them as close to the right size as possible. The width is more important than the length; you can always trim off any excess foil from the top of your nail.



If you cannot find special foil adhesive, you can paint on a layer of top coat instead.,, If you are using holographic cellophane, check to see if it is the same on both sides. If it isn't, then make sure that you are pressing it holographic-side-up into the adhesive or top coat. Next, position the base of the foil piece against the base of your nail, then press it down. Any excess foil should be hanging over the tip of your nail.
 This will help adhere it to your nail, as well as smooth out any wrinkles or air bubbles. Avoid applying too much pressure, or it may rip!, If you are using foil, it is thin enough so that you can tear off any excess or overhang. If you are using cellophane, use a pair of nail clippers to trim off any excess from the tip of your nail.
 If you can, try to use a top coat designed specifically for nail art.
