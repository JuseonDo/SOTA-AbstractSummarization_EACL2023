 Add a ½ to 1 cup sugar depending on how sweet you want your nuts to be,as well as up to 1 teaspoon of salt. You can also add other ingredients to spice up the recipe:


Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon for delicious cinnamon-sugar nuts.Add ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper for spicier nuts.For really flavor-packed nuts, add ¼ teaspoon cumin, ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon dried ground orange peel.;
, Substitute unsalted butter if you are using salt in the recipe.,, You want to keep stirring until the sugar melts and coats the nuts, which should become golden brown and release a strong nutty aroma., Either separate them immediately using two forks, or wait until they have cooled and break the nuts apart. Store in an airtight container.
