 If you are going to be sewing this onto something, be sure to leave room if you plan on sewing the edges under.;
, You can either find this in a magazine, or print one from your computer. Make sure to adjust the print size so that it will be the right size for the patch. Remember that if you are going to be cutting out letters or complicated shapes, you might have a complicated stencil!

, Make sure you have something protective underneath, the razor will definitely go through the paper, and you'll want to protect your table or whatever it is that you're working on.
 Take your stencil and place it on the patch where you intend the design to be. Tape it down as close as you can to the edges. Also make a tape loop and attach it to the fabric wherever there is enough room on the underside of the stencil. The more secure it is, the better.
 Put some paint on your brush and begin painting over the stencil. Take your time and be careful around the edges.
 You may need to go over the stencil with more than one coat of paint.
 Voila!

, Just be careful about the back, acrylic paint may bleed through to the back of fabric, so be sure to put something behind it.
