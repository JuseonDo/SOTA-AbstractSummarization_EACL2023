 Surf is a hidden move that a Pokémon can learn. You have to defeat the gym leader in Petalburg then go into the house located to the left of the gym. The man there will give the hidden move to you.;
, It is located at the easternmost portion of the mainland of Hoenn.
 If you see Wailmer blocking the way to the edge of the water, you need to go back to Slateport City and watch the rival team steal the submarine from the Ferry.
 Do this by pressing “A” near the edge of the water.
 You will encounter trainers along the way whose primary Pokémon are water type.
 Try to use Pokémon strong against water types to win battles faster.
 Keep going until you see a shoreline with a couple of trees on it.


Consult your PokéNav from time to time to ensure that you are on the right track. To access your PokéNav, press the “Start” button and select “PokéNav” to view the map.
 You should see a banner telling you that you have arrived at Mossdeep City.
