 Four chairs might be over the top, one will probably suffice. You can use beanbags and a small table, if you prefer.
 Buy a toaster or borrow one from elsewhere in the house. If you're allowed, and it's not a fire risk, put a microwave in your kitchen area. This will make cooking and preparing food easier in your bedroom.
