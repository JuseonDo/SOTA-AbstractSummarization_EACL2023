 Be nice to your friends, and compliment them. Act nice to most other people, as well.;
, Your clothes do not have to be designer brand, but they should look nice. Accessorize your outfit with shiny jewelry, scarves, or a fancy hairstyle.
 Mackenzie owns many purses, and buys them constantly. You don't need to do this, but having a purse or two will help you look nice.
 Wash your face every day, and shower (at least) every other day. Use facial cleanser and scrubs to make your skin soft and smooth.
 Talk about upcoming events, parties, school dances, and most anything that your friends want to talk about. Try not to spread intentionally untrue or excessively mean rumors, and if a friend asks you not to tell anyone something, respect that.
 You can also use texting apps, so you can text your friends.
 After that, you can strut along the corridor like the queen you are.
