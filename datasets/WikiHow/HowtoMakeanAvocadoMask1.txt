 Use the back of a fork to smoosh the avocado up well, and to get rid of any lumps. Avocado is great for the skin, because it is full of healthy fats and oils. These fats and oils help moisturize and nourish your skin.


Save the other half of the avocado for eating later, or for another mask.;
, Honey is one of the best things you can put on your skin. It is naturally hydrating, antibacterial, and antimicrobial. This means that it can help moisturize your face while killing off acne-causing bacteria.
 Yogurt is very beneficial to the skin. Not only is it naturally hydrating, but the lactic acid in it helps kill acne-causing bacteria. The lactic acid in it is also gently exfoliating as well. It may also help restore your skin's pH.The higher the fat percentage, the more moisturizing your face mask will be.If you have very dry skin, try full-fat, Greek yogurt. If you have oily skin, however, try low-fat yogurt instead., Face masks are meant to nourish and hydrate your skin, so you need to start with a clean face. Use warm water, and if necessary, a little bit of facial cleanser, to wash your face. The warm water is important, because it will open up your pores, and make it easier for your skin to absorb all those nutrients in the mask.
 You can apply the mask using your fingertips or a clean foundation brush; take care to avoid the eye and lip area, however!

, You can pass the time by listening to some music, reading a book, or watching a show. The less you move around, the less likely the mask will be to drip everywhere!

, After this, you can follow up with your usual skincare regime, such as toner and moisturizer. You may not need to use any moisturizer, however, due to how moisturizing this mask is!
