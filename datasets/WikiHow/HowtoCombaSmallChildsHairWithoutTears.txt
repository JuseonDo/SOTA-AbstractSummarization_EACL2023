@article
 Spray this over the child's hair to begin with.;
, Instead, get a small comb or brush and start at the surface of the tangle and carefully work your way down.
 This will help to stop any pulling of the brush or comb from hurting. Always use a wide-toothed comb when combing your child's hair.
 Slowly work your way up.
, Make it fun for your little one by letting them brush another person or doll's hair. Set up a hair salon. Have your child sit in a chair in front of the mirror and you, the adult are the hair stylist. Let your child brush their own clients hair (a doll). Reward after with some bows and hairclips.
 Give them a doll's hair to practice on.
, This will distract them.
 Wash your child's hair with a shampoo and conditioner at the end of the bath. Don't scrub, rub. Massage the shampoo and conditioner into your child's hair. It may be best for you to do this the first few times and let your child do the same thing to a doll. Once they have the hang of it, let them wash their own hair, looking into a mirror. Gently pat the hair dry after a bath or whenever it is wet and needs dried instead of rubbing.
