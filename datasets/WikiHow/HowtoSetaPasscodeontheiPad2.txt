 You'll need to have a passcode set in order to create a Touch ID passcode.,, This is the grey gear app on your home screen.
 The "Touch ID" section will only appear for iPads with a Touch ID-enabled home button.
 This will open the Passcode settings, from which you can set a new Touch ID.
, Make sure you aren't pressing the home button--you only need to lightly touch it.
 Your iPad may also prompt you to remove your finger with on-screen text., You will have to scan your finger eight times., You'll need to scan different parts of your finger in order to complete the Touch ID process.
 The edge you use will vary depending on how you normally tap your home button.


For example, if you normally use the outside of your right thumb to tap the home button, you would repeatedly touch that edge to the home button here.
, Your Touch ID is now active!

, You'll need to verify that your Touch ID works.
, This should unlock your iPad after a second or so.


If your chosen finger doesn't work, try using a different finger.
