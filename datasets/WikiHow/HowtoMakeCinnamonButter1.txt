 The cream will be liquid at first, but it will start to thicken after 5 minutes. At 15 minutes, it will start to turn solid with some liquid at the bottom. Stop the mixer at this point.;
, Let the liquid drain out, so that just the butter remains. You will be using this lump of homemade butter in your recipe.
 Roll the butter into a ball, squeeze it in your fist over a sink, and run it under cold water. This will remove any excess buttermilk and create a firmer texture. You will end up with about Â½ cup (115 grams) of butter.
 If the butter is too hard, let it reach room temperature first. This will make mixing it easier later on.
 From time to time, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl so that everything mixes evenly. You do not want any lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 Try to use a glass container instead of a plastic one; it will preserve the flavor the best. At this point, the butter is ready to serve. If it is too soft, you can leave it in the fridge for a few minutes to firm up.
 It will last 5 to 6 months in the fridge. It is perfect on bagels, sweet breads, and toast.
