 Mix together well.;
, Combine by stirring through gently; this forms the fondant for the centre of the violet creams.
 Place the violet fondant onto the work surface and begin to knead it. Knead until a firm ball forms under your hands.
 Place into the refrigerator to chill. Leave for around 30 minutes.
 As each ball is formed, flatten it slightly and set aside on a plate. As it is chilling, line the baking tray with the baking paper or parchment.
 Heat about 5cm/2" of water in the lower level of the bain marie. Add the dark chocolate and peanut oil in the bowl. Warm the mixture until the chocolate melts. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes.
 Either use a chocolate dipper or hold the fondant with two forks.
 Place the crystallised violet in the middle of the chocolate topping.
