ask for a real egg in a breakfast item.fast food joints like mcdonalds use up to three kinds of egg during their breakfast hours.

@summary
get a value menu equivalent of a full-priced entree.because many of the value menu items are essentially streamlined versions of the full-priced entrees, you can essentially get discounted versions of the same thing with the right choice of words.

combine breakfast and lunch items during the breakfast menu shift.although it's arguably the toughest menu hack to accomplish, placing an order within five minutes of the restaurant's breakfast menu switching to the regular lunch fare means you'll be able to take advantage of both menus.

 If you ask for a real egg (the egg used in their McMuffin sandwiches) you can instantly improve a regular breakfast item that would normally come with something inferior without having to pay the extra money.
 Say you would like the value item prepared in the manner of the entree it's supposed to mirror. Although you may have to pay extra for the added toppings, it will still come up as less than what you would have paid for the real deal.



The most well-known value item stack is the "McGangbang", a McDonalds item where you place a dollar menu Junior Chicken inside a McDouble.
 By customizing your order, you can help ensure that your meal is as fresh as possible.
 Fast food joints salt their fries by default. If you specifically ask to have them without salt, they'll have to make a fresh batch specifically for you. Because fry batches are typically left in a warmer, getting fresh fries is an easy way of improving your dining experience without paying anything more. You can always add salt to the fries manually if you want them.


Keep in mind that this won't get you in the good graces of the restaurant staff, especially if you come in and do this on a regular basis. It means more work for the staff, so only do this if you're really intent on fresh fries.
 "Hacking" the menu like this means you can create a ton of combinations on your own, like egg on a cheeseburger.
