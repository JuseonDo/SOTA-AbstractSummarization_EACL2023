 Start with clean hands.;
, Clean all fruits and vegetables before eating. Wash them under running water and dry them with a clean towel.
 Keep hot foods such as soup, chili or stew hot - 140 °F (60 °C) or above - by using an insulated container. Preheat the thermos with hot water and let stand. Drain the hot water and fill with hot food.
 Use an insulated lunch bag. Metal or plastic lunch boxes and paper bags can also be used. Double sack paper lunch bags to increase their insulation qualities.
 Harmful bacteria multiply rapidly between the temperatures of 40 degrees and 140 °F (60 °C).
 Use a frozen juice pack to keep things cold. Also, freeze sandwiches to help keep them chilled until lunchtime. The sandwiches will be thawed in time for lunch.
 If a refrigerator is available at school, that's the best option to keep food cold.
, Toss what's left of lunch rather than saving the food for another lunch.
 Consider keeping a supply of shelf-stable foods on hand for easy packing. These include crackers, nuts, dried fruit, peanut butter, packaged pudding and canned fruits or meats.
 Making up the lunch the night before can be a real time saver. Sandwiches should be kept in the refrigerator, or frozen, until time to go in the morning.
 Line up the ingredients assembly line style and make a bunch of sandwiches in bulk. This is much like Once-a-Month cooking where foods are all prepared at once for later use. Freeze the sandwiches for later use.[[Image:Pack a Healthy and Safe Lunch Step 12.jpg}}
