 (Calculate how much money you will get from the essence you have once you make air runes out of all of it.)

, To make an air tiara: Bring an air talisman and a tiara into the air altar. Use the tiara with the altar, and your talisman will fuse into the tiara, making an air tiara.
 Make air runes. At higher levels you can make multiple runes from one essence. If you have 1k essences, then you will make 3k air runes, and you can sell them all at 45k which is a 15k profit from which you bought the essence.


Here is a useful chart to track what you should do with so much money and how much essence you should buy:

1k essences will be 3k air runes, which equals 45k. Buy another 1k essences, make air runes out of them, and sell for 45k. Now, amazingly, you have 60k.
Buy 2k essences for 60k. (You have no more money, but it's fine.) Make air runes out of all of it! You will have 6k air runes.
Sell those, and get 90k. Buy 3k essences!
Make 9k air runes out of that, and get 135k.
 Soon you will be rich! And, someday you will be able to make chaos runes, nature runes, or even law runes! You may even do better than that.
