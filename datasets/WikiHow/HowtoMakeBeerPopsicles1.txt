 Open each can only at the time you're making the popsicles, so that the beer doesnâ€™t go flat or sit around too long.;
, Roll the lime softly on the counter before cutting open, to help release the juices. When squeezing the lime into the beer, hold the lime with the skin in your palm and the cut end upward. That way you eliminate or reduce the likelihood that seeds will fall into your brew.
 Stir for up to 15 seconds to ensure that the lime juice and nectar permeate the entire drink.
