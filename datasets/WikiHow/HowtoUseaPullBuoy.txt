 Buoys come in small and large sizes, and you will need to try them out in a store to see what feels the most natural for your body type.;
, This will help you get your balance before trying to float and make it easier to place once you are prepared to swim.
 For optimal results, insert the buoy as high up your legs as possible. It can be harder to control the buoy the closer it gets to your knees.
 A good rule to remember is to face downward and forward a bit, and contract your sternum. This is the natural position you need to focus on when you're not swimming with a pull buoy.
,, This streamlines your body and creates a straighter line as well as limits the mass needed to push through the water.
 With a pull buoy, you should not have to work as hard to swim, and you can use this opportunity to slow down your breathing. Less breathing equals less exertion, and you are less fatigued.
 A pull buoy allows you to float effortlessly in the correct position, so that you can really focus other aspects of your stroke, such as hand entry, release point, and wall push-offs. Each time you use this training method, focus on a different part of your technique to improve.
