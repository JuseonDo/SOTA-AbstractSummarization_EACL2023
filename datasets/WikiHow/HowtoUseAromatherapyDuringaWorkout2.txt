 Mix a solution in a spray bottle with 3 oz. (90 ml) of water and 1 oz. (30 ml) of witch hazel. Also, include 5 drops of sage, 7 drops of cypress and 12 drops of bergamot essential oils.


Cover your eyes and spray on your skin as you are sweating. It should be used on the face, back, chest or anywhere that you are prone to breakouts. Try it on a small area of the skin, if you have very sensitive skin.
 This will help to increase circulation and the effectiveness of the stretch.
 This will remove the previous aromatherapy spray and oil blends, but it will wash away sweat and prepare your body for a long-lasting sore muscle treatment.
