 However, to learn the basics and practice, you might want to use a Forge or Custom Game to use it on where you can learn at your own pace.;
, This will make your character enter the Ghost and turn on the power to it. A message may appear, prompting you to enter the Ghost when you near the vehicle.
 Unlike when on foot however, you will not be able to zoom in by pressing the Right Joystick.
 The amount of pressure you place on the joystick will be relative to how fast you want the Ghost to travel. Use the joysticks in combination to turn and maneuver around the map. If you apply no pressure to the Left Joystick, the Ghost will remain stationary and will also not show on your opponent's radar.
 The Ghost will continue to fire as long as you apply pressure to the trigger. Although the guns are not as powerful as other weapons in the game, they can be used at a fair distance with effect. However, you will not be able to move as freely whilst firing.
 This will speed the ghost along the ground at a faster pace than usual, although you will not be able to shoot and you will not be able to turn as freely whilst the boost is applied. The boost however is useful for ramming opponents with your vehicle. If you kill them, this is called a 'Splatter' and counts as a kill towards your character.
 However, pressing A only slows the vehicle down and raises the front of the ghost, rather than stopping it all together and is very ineffective whilst applying boost. Simply ceasing to apply pressure or move the Left Joystick is a much better alternative. However, pressing A can come in handy if you are about to make a large jump or avoid small obstacles, as it raises your vehicle's front allowing for some ground clearance beneath it.
 It will exit your character from the vehicle and the Ghost will cease to move.
 A message may appear, prompting you to flip the Ghost when you near it. The Ghost will function as normal after you have flipped it.
