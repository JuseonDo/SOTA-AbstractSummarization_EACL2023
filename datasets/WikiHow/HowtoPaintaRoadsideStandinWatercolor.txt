,  Take your own pictures for a personal connection to this art work.
  Google: roadside farm stands, farm markets, produce, vegetables and fruits, etc.  Magazines and seed catalogues will have nice images, also.,  Either way will work fine. Plot out the stand by drawing a horizontal line across the page approximately 1/4 up from the bottom.  In the middle of the page, draw a rectangle for the stand, as tall and wide as you'd like.
  Do horizontal lines from side to side and go back to give them depth by doing a second set of lines.
  Anything you can imagine is good.
  Draw baskets, boxes, or other containers to hold the bounty.  Vary shapes and sizes using apples, pears, melons, pumpkins, gourds, squash, Indian corn, onions, bunched radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.
  Make colorful displays.
  Corn stalks, wreaths, quilts, hand-made brooms, flower bouquets, pottery, etc.  Even little potted trees for sale.,  Bushels and Pecks, Farmer's Best, Fruits, Jams and Pickles, Eat Local,  Bouquets and anything that comes to mind to sell the goods.,,  Begin any place you desire.  Do detailed elements first, or do the background first, your choice.,  Remember to vary sizes, shapes, colors and patterns on the fruits and vegetables.  Add flower bouquets if you wish.,  Add lively elements like birds, pets, people and a scarecrow.,  It can be a busy or simple as you wish.  Branches in upper corners help fill those areas, if desired.  Achieve distance by making colors lighter and duller as things recede.,  Let it dry, then do touch-ups.  Brighten areas that need it.  Add texture to baskets, shadows, grasses, etc.
  Hang it up and enjoy it.  Mat and frame it for over the Thanksgiving table to remind us to be grateful for nature's gifts.
