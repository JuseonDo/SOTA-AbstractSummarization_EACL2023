Some cooks advise adding 20 percent more water than the directions call for. Adding more water will make the food soupier.;
,


Some freeze-dried foods come in canisters with more than one portion. If the instructions on the package call for 2 cups (400 grams) of freeze-dried food, put 2 cups of food into a container that you can cover after adding hot water.
Freeze-dried food also comes in pre-measured, single-serving pouches to which you add hot water.
, Stir. Cover the container or seal the pouch.
 Open the container or pouch and stir the contents again. If all the food is rehydrated, it is ready to eat.


If the meat or pasta is still tough or isn't rehydrated, stir and reseal the package. Wait 5 minutes, stir again, then serve the food.
