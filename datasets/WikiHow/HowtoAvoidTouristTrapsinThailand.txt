 They will either overcharge you or take you somewhere that gives them a commission.;
, If they say the meter has broken, get another taxi. Alternatively, you could establish the price before leaving (not when you arrive) but this is unlikely to be a fair price.
 They will generally not get a commission and will know some good places.
 When going to a temple, always dress respectfully - shirts (not sleeveless) and long trousers. Leave your shoes at the door. Don’t point your feet or touch the head of a Buddhist monk or even a statue of Buddha. The head is the highest point of the body and the feet the lowest and therefore highly disrespectful.
 If you are unsure about the reputation of a particular establishment, check with the Jewel Fest Club or the Thai Gem and Jewelry Traders Association on (66 2) 267 5233-6. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is! If you're shop owner and looking for fair prices, better to buy jewelry directly at factories.
 Some places are known to corner foreigners in empty rooms and later present them with a false hefty bill, refusing to let them leave unless the bill is paid. If you do get into such a situation, pay the bill and then go to the police immediately.
 They will ask you to buy them stuff (mobile phones, jewelry, etc.) and they will ask for your e-mail address so they can keep milking you for money once you're back home. Typical excuses include sick parents/siblings who need surgery, money for education, etc. Be careful to let them down gently, however as it is common politeness and just in case the girl actually likes you.
