 Your Nespresso machine will need to be descaled about every three months. If you drink a lot of coffee, you should descale it every 300 capsules. Some models have a light on the machine that blinks when you need to descale.If you connect your machine to the online app, the app will tell you when your machine needs to be descaled.
 Before you begin, make sure you empty the capsule container of all capsules. You should also empty the drip tray. Replace them back into the machine. Then, turn the machine on.
 Depending on your model, you will press different buttons to start the descaling mode. The buttons will blink, and the machine will beep when you can let go. This lets you know you are in the descaling mode.The VertuoLine has one button you need to hold for around seven seconds.
The Pixie, Inissia, and Citiz models have two flashing buttons you hold at the same time for approximately three seconds.
For the Prodigio, press the three coffee buttons at the same time. Hold them for three to six seconds.
 Pour one container of Nespresso descaling solution into the water tank. Then, add half a liter of water. Close the slider and place a container large enough to catch all of the water from the water tank under the coffee outlet.You can buy the descaling solution from the Nespresso website.
 If you don’t want to buy a commercial descaling solution, you can make your own. Run the homemade solution through the machine just like commercial solution. Before using a homemade solution, make sure to check the instruction manual or call the manufacturer to make sure it is safe.You can make a solution with citric acid. Use 1 part citric acid to 20 parts water. You can also use lemon juice or vinegar. Mix equal parts of either liquid with equal parts water.
If you use citric acid or lemon juice, rinse the machine twice before making coffee. If you use vinegar, run five rinse cycles.
 Press any of the blinking coffee buttons. This begins descaling your machine. The machine will run the water through the machine and expel the water into the container under the coffee outlet.When the machine stops pushing the water through the outlet, it is done.
 Pour the water in the container back into the water tank to go through the descaling process again. Once again, press one of the blinking buttons to start the machine. The machine will do the same thing as before. When it is finished, it will stop running and the water will be back in the container., Toss out the solution that ran through the machine. Remove the water tank, drip tray, and cup support. Rinse them thoroughly with warm water. Make sure all of the residue from the descaling solutions is completely rinsed from the parts.Reassemble the machine once you’ve rinsed and dried the parts.
 Fill the water tank with clean water and place the container back under the coffee outlet. Click one of the blinking lights to make the machine run the clean water through it. This rinses the solution from the machine. Pour out the water.Place clean water into the water tank and hit the blinking lights to repeat the rinsing process once more.
 After you have rinsed the machine with clean water twice, you are done with the descaling process. Press all three coffee buttons until the machine beeps. This lets you know you have exited descaling mode.Let the machine dry for at least 10 minutes before you use again.
