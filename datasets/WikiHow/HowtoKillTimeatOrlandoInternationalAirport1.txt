 Walking and staring at the windowsill watching planes go by can pass some time while keeping abreast of what's going on in this world at this airport. Watch to see what planes take off and land prior to your airplane's boarding process. Make guesses as to where planes are coming from and going, and see how many different airlines you can identify.;
, Don't get too chatty at this point; some passengers are hoping to get to the gates in an orderly fashion and don't want to be talked to for too long., Pray to the "person above" (Him) and for at least a safe travel with your family. You may need to look around the airport to find it, but there is a chapel on each side of the terminals of the airport.
