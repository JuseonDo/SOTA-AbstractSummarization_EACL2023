 Hijabs come in many styles. You can try pinning or tying your scarf in new ways, or consider one-piece or two-piece pull-on hijabs.;
, Try avoiding bright pink, red or acid green, etc. Dark brown, grey blue, black is encouraged. Dark and bold colors.
 Options include hanging beads along the edges of the material or selecting vibrant colors. Make sure that your understanding of hijab as general modest dress is compatible with the way you dress.
 For example, if your dress is yellow then wear some darker color hijab.
, Remember to cover the important parts of hijab rules i.e. neck, hair and chest. When with your family, and you are not wearing the hijab, take trouble to look good for your family or closest relatives (sisters, parents) and for your husband. It counts as a form of worship! also avoid wearing a huge hump .
