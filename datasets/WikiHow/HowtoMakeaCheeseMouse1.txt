 These are often of European origin and come in an array of tasty flavors, wrapped in foil. (For example, Laughing Cow Swiss cheese wedges.);
,, Cut small slivers of sausage (meat or vegetarian) to make the ears. Insert at the pointed tip end of the wedge, which is the face end of the mouse.
 Add small black sesame seeds, pepitas, or flecks of olives for the eyes.
 Cut a small piece of olive with the end of a straw and add the circle to the tip of the wedge.
 For example, a piece of chive stem or a length of pretzel. If you have the ability to make long curls from vegetables, use carrot or celery curls for the tail.
 It's now ready to serve.
