 Or are you just wasting your time, when you could be practicing your other hobby? Be sure, before choosing something as a career. After all, it's a matter of a lifetime. You don't want to spend your whole lifetime doing what you opted ten years back.;
,, Keep it with you all the time, take it everywhere. Label all the colors. If you have any idea, sketch it there and then!

, Don't let someone's harsh comment drag you backwards. Style is all about creating your own. Even if someone tells you, it's odd, tell them that style is what you create yourself, sometimes it may seem odd to someone, while someone will find it cute. so don't be discouraged by someone's harsh comment.
 Have a good fashion and style sense.
 Ask him to make a dress like drawn in that design. Don't worry it will not cost you a fortune!

,, that you'll need to sew, so that you won't need to go hunting for useful things, and you find it immediately!

, read magazines, spend your time with videos, your fashion portfolio, if you have free time enhance your imagination, boost yourself and gain experience about fashion.
 Turn your old shirts to bikinis. or your long-sleeved T-shirts into skirts or your jeans into denim skirts. Or your skirt into beautiful artificial flowers.
 Try to see how people find your clothes.
 Give time to your work. Give it your life and death.
