 of concentrated lemon juice)
1 or 2 tbsp. of baking soda
1 tsp. honey
Brown sugar to desired thickness

, Use a fork or a whisk to combine the lemon juice, baking soda, and honey in a bowl. Ensure that the mixture is smooth and free of clumps.
 How much brown sugar you add will depend on your own tastes. If you want the paste to be thicker, add more sugar; for a lighter, runnier exfoliating paste, add less sugar.
 Make sure the paste is free of lumps. Also make sure that it is not too runny, otherwise it may drip into your eyes or on your clothes or furniture.
 Use lukewarm water and gently massage your face as you wash it. Be sure to rinse it well. Be gentle as you pat your face dry so as not to irritate your skin.
 Using gentle, circular motions, apply the mixture to your face and neck with your fingertips.
 You will likely feel some light tingling and tightening. This is the mask doing its job! If your skin begins to burn, however, wash the mask off right away.
 Dampen a washcloth with lukewarm water and then use gentle, circular motions to move the mixture from your skin.


You may need to rinse out the cloth and re-wet it a few times to completely and thoroughly remove the mixture from your skin.
 Use the coldest water you can handle, as this will help close your pores and lock in the benefits of the mask. Afterward, gently pat your face dry with a clean, dry washcloth.
 Once your face is clean and dry, apply your favorite moisturizer to your face and neck. Even without the moisturizer, you should notice that your skin is smoother and brighter even after one treatment.
 Only do this mask once a week. Doing it more than that may cause your skin to become dry and irritated. The mask should improve the quality of your skin and reduce the appearance of acne.
