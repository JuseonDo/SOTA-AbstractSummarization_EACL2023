 There could be a fee involved, so be prepared to pay the filing fee.;
, Make sure you have the correct amount of authorized signatures (with valid voting rights, address, name) from citizens in order to be placed into the ballot. To be safe collect a few extra signatures to make sure you qualify.
 Are there rules you want changed? Are there loopholes in the current system? Come up with a list of what you want changed, you will trim this list down later.
 Try to aim for three and elaborate on them. Take a voters point of view and what do you think they want, you could ask your friends for advice. Sell yourself out to the public with what they want, but what you can achieve. All in all, what makes you better than your opponent?

, Use what are comfortable with, whether that's the entire Microsoft suite or just paper.
 Divide your calendar so that everyday is split into morning, afternoon and night. Doing so will help you avoid cramming at the last minute!

, Having the available funds that can be used to publicize your events, will go along way to winning the public over. Holding fundraising events is a way to do this, though you could also ask for donations. Make it reasonable, aim for more people to give a smaller amount of money rather than few people making large donations. You may want to select another person to be in charge of this.
 Go for a variety of media's so that you will sell to an audience.
 Go to every house, introduce yourself and state the mains points of why you should be elected. Ask for their contact information so that you can contact them again since research has shown that three times of contact will sway their decision to you. Another good idea is to go to public buildings with a large body of people.
 Make yourself available to questions that others may ask and engage yourself with the general public.
