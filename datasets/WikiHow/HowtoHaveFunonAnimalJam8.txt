get 1000 gems, buy a new animal avatar, and make the animal an aquatic animal (you will only be able to get a seal, penguin, and a turtle if you're not a member) and explore the underwater areas of animal jam.

 It is very fun to explore these stages because you can collect different plants/animals and add them to your scrapbook. To collect them, simply click on them. It is also fun because you can run away from 'vicious' underwater animals like sharks and crocodiles who might attack you, or if you are a 'vicious' underwater animal like a shark or a crocodile, you can chase after 'prey' or pick fights with other 'tough' predators.
