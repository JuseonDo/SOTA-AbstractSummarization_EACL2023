@summary
gather and chop your chocolate into even pieces.

@summary
heat up a pot of water, but do not bring it to boil.

@summary
place the chocolate pieces in a completely dry, stainless steel bowl, and then onto the steaming pan.

@summary
melt the chocolate, stirring, until it is just at 110°f.

@summary
introduce the remaining 1/3 solid chocolate into melted chocolate and continue stirring.

@summary
begin "tabling" the chocolate on a smooth, cool surface such as marble.

@summary
stirring constantly, wait until the chocolate gets to a temperature of 87°–91°f.

 A serrated knife works well here, although you can skip the cutting altogether if you decide to buy chocolate chips or coins.


Set aside approximately 1/3 of the chopped chocolate for later use. It will not be used in the initial double-boiling.
 You want steam to be coming from the pot, but boiling water can cause the chocolate to scorch or melt too quickly.
 Make sure the bowl with the chocolate rests on top of the pan, keeping any moisture or water away from the chocolate. Water that is introduced to chocolate can cause it to seize.
 Do not melt beyond this point or the chocolate will scorch.
 Heat until the mixture becomes smooth again.
 Take the chocolate off the heat and spread 2/3 of it over a cool surface. Next:


With a spatula, work the melted chocolate by scraping and stirring it across the cool surface. This process will smooth and cool the chocolate.
Continue tabling until a temperature of 80°–82°F is reached. Return the cooled mixture to the reserved mixture and put the whole mixture on top of the light heat again.
 Take chocolate off the double boiler. Use the chocolate in molds, biscuits, cookies, dipping, etc.


Is the chocolate sticky to the touch even after a little while? Sticky chocolate has not been properly tempered.The chocolate should set and be firm after 2 to 3 minutes.
