 Get some strawberry fruit juice, popsicle sticks, popsicle molds, and some strawberries.;
, Place a generous amount of strawberries into the bottom of the popsicle molds.
 Once the strawberries are placed pour the strawberry juice over the strawberries. Be careful not to fill it up too high since the might expand.
 This step is very important because is you forget to put in popsicle sticks it will be very hard to get the popsicle out of the cup.
 Make these popsicles before you go to bed so you'll have a nice treat in the morning.
 Share your popsicles with family and friends.
