 For this pizza, a good (healthy) choice would be a crispy thin crust or a New York style. However, any healthy crust will do.
 Put three eggs in a bowl and stir them thoroughly. Pour the eggs on the crust and spread them as the base. If three is not enough, you may add more.
 Baby spinach leaves go first, gently soaking in the eggs. Add mozzarella cheese and onions.
