 Prevent problems before they can occur by eating healthy and exercising regularly.;
, Read warning labels (using your glasses, if you need them) before using.
 If you have a sore throat, go to a family doctor or a clinic. Emergency room charges are very high and you will want to use that service only in dire cases.
 You need to see a doctor who will find ways to treat you which do not involve overpriced medications which you may not need.
 Don’t hesitate to ask for a sample that you have a prescription for. Every little bit helps. However, keep in mind that the samples will be given mainly for expensive drugs. In many cases, cheap alternatives are available, and drug companies do not give free samples for drugs on which they don't stand to make a large profit.
 Meijer even offers some for free. Shopping online can also save up to twenty percent.
 Ask your doctor if he can prescribe your drug in a higher dosage so that you can cut your pills in half. This way you will get a double amount of dosages for the same price. However, not all pills can be split in this manner. Gel capsules and time release capsules cannot be split.
 Call hospitals and doctors offices before you show up for a procedure, and get the details of what the facility is going to charge you. This knowledge may help in negotiation of a better deal or to motivate you to search for a more affordable practitioner. At the very least, your doctor will be more price conscious if she knows that her patients are asking questions.
 Always ask the price before getting work. Once you learn the price, explain that you have no insurance and you would like to have a discount.
 Doctors are running to make a profit for their practice. Some more so than others. If a doctor is recommending extra tests or procedures, especially ones not covered by insurance, get a second opinion to see if these are necessary.
