 Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon sheet.
, Keep in a single layer; don't overlap.
 Dip a pastry brush into the bowl and brush both sides of each baguette slice. You'll need to keep re-dipping in the olive oil.
 This step is optional but if liked, you can sprinkle the top of each piece with salt and pepper or perhaps with a spice such as paprika or sumac.
 Bake for 5-6 minutes, then remove and turn over the slices. Return to the oven and bake for another 5-6 minutes or until golden.
 Place on a cooling rack to cool completely.
 If storing, keep in an airtight container. These will keep for weeks if the container remains airtight.
