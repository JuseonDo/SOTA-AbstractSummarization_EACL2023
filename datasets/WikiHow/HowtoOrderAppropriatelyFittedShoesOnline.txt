 Shoes come in a variety of sizes which range from baby and kids' sizes to the largest known man's size: 37AA (He was 8' 11" tall). As his shoe size tells us there's two measurements, length and width. So, the first thing you'll want to do is place your foot on a piece of paper that's larger than your foot.;
,, Record this measurement as accurately as possible for both tracings. This will be used to assess the numerical size.
 As before with the length, record this measurement for both tracings. This will be used to assess the alphabetical size.
 Generally speaking, the number from the length measurement will be the same as your US size, but for best fit, you'll need to assess your width (A is narrowest, EEE is widest, and B and D are standard, for women and men, respectively).
 Lasts vary slightly from cobbler to cobbler, so it's important to know about your cobbler.


If you've bought shoes from the same company before, you should know whether their shoes fit "true to size" or not, and be able to adjust accordingly.
If you haven't bought shoes from this company before, read the reviews for information concerning fit, then adjust accordingly.
,, And, that's it! You'll have a new, well-fitted pair of shoes in no time!
