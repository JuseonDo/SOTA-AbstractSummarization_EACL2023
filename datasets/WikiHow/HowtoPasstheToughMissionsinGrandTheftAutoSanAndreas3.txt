@summary
it helps a lot to get the homing rocket launcher before this mission.

@summary
drive ahead of the preacher's limo.

@summary
don't shoot at the bikes.

@summary
at the beginning, you can often position yourself to grab one or two packages from the bikes right away.

@summary
for regular bike driving, drive on the center line to avoid most of the traffic.

@summary
use the homing rocket launcher for this one.approach the helipad from the east side to make it easier.

@summary
these do not work, you cannot acquire a military helicopter before flight school (all gold even, iirc) and the pilot spawns after you reach the helipad and the heli is already in mid-air as the cutscene ends.

@summary
after getting out of the airport, it helps to get out of the car and shoot the motorcycle drivers yourself.

@summary
shoot the planes while they're far away.get the groups of planes in particular.once a plane has passed by or dropped its bomb, it may be possible to ignore it entirely after that, so move to the next planes.

@summary
concentrate on accuracy.

@summary
to fly the plane, simply hold down the accelerator (although you may want to release it while shooting to give you more time to shoot,) and use small left-stick adjustments to control the plane.

@summary
start with the nearby courier, then the bike one, then the suv one (usually west,) then check the map.

 To get that, drive a car up next to the guard station at the airport. Have CJ climb on top of the car, then jump up onto the office. Then run around to open the gates. Also, you can park your car in front of the gate to keep it open, and just stand CJ on the line between the sidewalk and the road, to make the jump onto the top of the office. The rocket launcher is on the eastern-most side of the airport, between some fuel tanks, which are to the right of the hangars south (or right) of the control tower., (Don't shoot them yet.) Get out far enough ahead, and aim the homing rocket launcher. Shoot the limo twice, and it will be done. Also make sure it's far enough away to protect the pimp-mobile., Simply drive up close and press the appropriate button (L1 on ps2) repeatedly to grab the package off of the back., Use the middle line for the road as a reference., But watch for turning cars, etc. If you can, drive on the side of the road, if there's a gap between the sidewalk and the traffic., (See "Jizzy" steps for how to get it.) Simply shoot it twice before the helicopter turns the corner.,, If you would like it to be even easier, you can always chase Toreno in a hunter or simply use the sniper rifle on the pilot before take-off. Do not chase the chopper in a car!, If a cop approaches the car while CJ's getting in, honk the horn to keep him from getting too close., To make the minigun more stable while aiming, release the firing button. And move between targets quickly to help save time.,,, If you shoot the gun accurately right from the get-go, the mission will be much easier. Watch the sparks of the machine gun hitting, to see where it's actually hitting. Once you have accuracy, you can shoot the couriers from much farther away, which is quicker, easier, safer for the Red Baron, etc., Most people's mistake is making too big of movements with the left stick, causing the plane to go everywhere. Use the degree of the plane's bank to control the turning speed of the plane, with an occasional pulling back., If the van courier has gone somewhere way too far, it's usually best to retry the mission. (It can happen sometimes.) Otherwise, get the Sanchez next. It's particularly important to get the Sanchez from far away (accuracy), because it can really shoot up the Red Baron. Then get the van courier, and head straight back for the home base. Try to keep the plane flying level to maximize speed. And just fly into the corona.
