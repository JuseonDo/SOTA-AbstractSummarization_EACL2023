 Alternatively, stretch a pair of a nylon cloth over a plastic container and place the henna and some coins on top of the nylon cloth. If you are using fresh henna leaves, use a crusher or mixer and powder it up. Cover the container and shake it to sift the henna through the nylon cloth.
 If you are using henna powder, do as so.

Allow the henna to rest for 24 hours at room temperature to draw the dye out of the henna.
You will see the dye separate into a layer above the rest of the henna mixture as it matures.
 Add additional lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) at a time, until the consistency of the henna is similar to the consistency of yogurt.










Twist the top of the henna cone 1 or 2 times and wrap it tightly with a rubber band.
Roll the rubber band downward until the henna is touching both the tip of the cone and the base of the rubber band. This setup creates a tight seal that will ensure that your henna dispenses properly.
