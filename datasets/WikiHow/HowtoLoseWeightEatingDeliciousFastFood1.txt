eat just a little like you would be allowed, if you had your stomach stapled or a stomach bypass done.

imagine this different suggestion: eat 5 or 6 bites of food twice per day.

@summary
consider weight loss surgery.

 Yes, eat as if you had "weight loss surgery".



No, bulimia or anorexia will not come from eating little for a few weeks! Those are totally different eating disorders with an obsessive, mental component, such as thinking "I'm still fat" (when boney/skinny), or repeatedly binging and purging.
 Try eating only two medium Snickers, Baby Ruth, or such bars a day.
Can you (if fairly healthy) eat candy safely. "Yes!", but you ask "How does that work?"

, If you chose surgery, then eat almost nothing for 3 or 4 months, by Doctor's Orders! Then never be able to eat a large meal ever again, for life...


Decide whether to have such surgery; if not, then: Skip the doctor's radical surgery and doctor ordered, forced "starvation", starving safely, how? Avoid doctor's knife and those ways to starve, if you do not have the surgery.
