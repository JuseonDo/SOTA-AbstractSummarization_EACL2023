 The Ziploc bag will keep bacteria from contaminating the chicken during the thawing process. It will also prevent bacteria from contaminating the sink., Make sure that the bowl is large enough for the chicken to be fully submerged in water.
 Make sure that the top of the chicken is covered.


Do not use hot water. Hot water will promote bacterial growth., A pound of chicken will be thawed in roughly an hour by using this method.If you are thawing a whole chicken, be prepared for it to take a bit longer. If your chicken is 3 pounds, it should be thawed for 3 or more hours.
 Raw chicken thawed using this method cannot be stored again while it is still raw.
