 Disclose all of your travel plans and have him fill out a medical certificate that indicates it is safe for you to travel.;
, For a pregnant woman who travels only occasionally, air pressure and radiation should not be worrisome.


Low cabin pressure has little effect on a pregnant woman or her fetus as the body is able to adapt to the deficiency naturally.
A fetus exposed to radiation has an increased risk of some cancers. At airport security, minimize the risk by asking that you be searched by hand or a wand instead of a security machine.



Many airlines restrict or strongly discourage pregnant women from traveling after 36 weeks. Some international airlines may have an earlier cut-off date. The majority of airlines also will require a medical certificate deeming it OK to fly in the last trimester.

Regular meals and snacks can fight travel-related fatigue. Extra water consumption can help you stay hydrated inside a very dry airplane cabin.
 The chances of survival in a crash dramatically increase through the use of a seat belt.


Buckle the seat belt low on your hips, positioning it below your baby bump. The shoulder belt should be positioned between your breasts.
