 Turn it upside down so that the fixed base is facing up.;
, In some cases you may be able to simply lift the tape and pull it across but that isn't always easy to do and if you're doing bulk boxes, it's often impractical. Instead:


Slide a scissor blade, box cutter or a craft knife through tape. A sturdy modern key will also do the trick. Pull it right along the tape, in the gap it overlaps between the flaps.
Run the blade through the tape sideways at each end to open completely.
Always face the blade away from you, just in case it slips.
,, It can now be stored, recycled or used as required.
