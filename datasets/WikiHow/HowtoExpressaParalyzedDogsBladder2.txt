 In this position the dog's head will be looking behind you.


You can also do this outside over grass, but it will probably be more convenient for you to simply take your pup into the bathroom.
 Then reach under her body with your right.
 Feel around for something that has the dimensions of a lemon and the consistency of a water balloon., It takes some practice, but the hardest part is learning the "feel" of the bladder.


This is the part that you veterinarian will be most helpful at explaining or demonstrating.
Your dog may lift their tail when you have found the right spot., When the urine stream goes from a stream to a trickle, the bladder is fully expressed.The bladder will feel "flat" once it is totally empty. It should take less than a minute for the whole bladder to empty.
