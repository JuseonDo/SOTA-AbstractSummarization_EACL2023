 You do not need to explain why, just state that you do not want the person to contact you., Ignore them completely, and don't respond to any of their messages, posts, etc.
 Make sure that it won't give away your real name, phone number, address, etc.
 Show them what this person is saying or doing to you. Get their opinion on what is happening.
 Even the little things that you don't think would matter could actually make a big difference., The legal definition, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is:
"A course of conduct directed at a specific person that causes substantial emotional distress in such person and serves no legitimate purpose" or "Words, gestures, and actions which tend to annoy, alarm and abuse (verbally) another person." However, keep in mind that this is a very broad definition. State and federal legislation and common law have narrowed and refined in various ways., Contact the nearest FBI office if they cannot or will not help you and your life is being threatened.
