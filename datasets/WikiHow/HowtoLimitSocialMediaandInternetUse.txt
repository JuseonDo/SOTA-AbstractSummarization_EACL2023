 Are you bored? Is it for fun? Try to identify with whatever the reasoning may be.;
, Constant use of social media can cause psychological stress along with negative feelings of depression or jealousy of those around you.
 Logging times can help you see how much time you are spending out of your day to visit certain sites. It can make you realize how much time you’re spending when you could be doing something better.
 If you have tried all you can and still cannot change your habits, talk to someone about your problem. It’s better to deal with these things at first hand.
 Start from most visited to least. Usually there are a couple sites you visit more often than others. For example, you might be more interested in your friends’ photos on Facebook rather than what they are talking about on Twitter.
 Notifications always pop up, and always tempt you to go through a certain application on site for hours on end. The best idea would be to delete, ignore, or turn them off all together.
 Getting rid of the problem is honestly the best solution. Once it’s gone, it’s gone forever (with an exception of some sites). You can even block the site/app on your browser or phone. And no, this doesn’t mean you should recreate another account or redownload the app.
 Actually go to limit yourself on how often or how long you use social media and the internet. Time yourself for an hour a day, or set a timer. There are even website blocking applications available now. It can help you be more productive throughout the day.
 Find what interests you. Find a new hobby. Whether it’s art, reading, writing, making music, sports, photography, etc. Start a better lifestyle. Try joining a gym or changing up eating habits. Help out the local community by volunteering. There is an endless list of options when it comes to finding something you like to do.
