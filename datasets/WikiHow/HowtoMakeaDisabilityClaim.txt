 While you seek treatment for your disability, you will also be required to provide a doctor's proof of your disability and some medical records.;
, These are available through the records office and/or reception of most hospitals and clinics.
 This will help you to decide if you should apply for social security disability or state disability. To receive national social security disability, you must be unable to work for a year or longer. Many state agencies provide disability insurance for shorter recovery periods.
 An Internet search using your state's name and the words "disability claim" should yield results and an online or printed disability application. The state programs differ greatly. Look for information on qualifications, benefit amounts, duration and application process.
 Disability benefits can take a long time to process and may need to be paid retroactively if you receive benefits.
 If you are impaired and unable to complete an application process or research the needed documentation, hiring a lawyer to represent and submit your claim may increase your chances of receiving national disability insurance.
 You may be limited by your state's application options. An Internet application may expedite the process.



Provide the following information as applicable: social security number, birth certificate, medical records including names, addresses and dates of all medical attention received, a list of all medication you are currently on, a summary of your recent work up to the last 5 jobs you have had, a copy of your most recent W-2 or tax return and bank account details.



Some doctor's offices send this and a completed application to the state disability insurance office. If so, complete your application before taking it to your doctor's office.

If you were denied benefits, you can appeal this decision. It is a good idea to seek counsel from a lawyer and research the social security or state appeals process.
