 The chopstick will serve as a skewer so you can rotate the peppers and remove them from the flame once they are done roasting. Alternately, you can forgo the chopsticks and use tongs instead.;
, You want a fairly large flame to ensure the quickest roasting time and sufficient blackening. Lower temperatures will require more gas and time to roast the peppers. You may want to line the stovetop with aluminum foil before lighting the flame, as this procedure can get messy.
, These noises simply tell you the skin is cracking and that the peppers are roasting. This is a good sign.
 You should rotate the peppers so that the entire surface is black and crispy. Don’t worry about that pitch black color. The flesh underneath will be perfectly fine.
 There are several ways you can proceed to cool the peppers.
Put them in a paper bag and close it. This will steam the peppers and aid in removing the skins. You can also place the peppers in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, or seal in a zip-top freezer bag, or put into a saucepan with the lid on.






Alternatively, plunge them immediately into an ice water bath. The ice water will stop the cooking process and facilitate the removal of the peppers’ skins. This method, however, is more likely to pull flavor out of the peppers.
 Once all the skin is off, place peppers on a cutting board.
 Scrape off the white membrane and seeds and discard. This can also be done by hand under running water.
