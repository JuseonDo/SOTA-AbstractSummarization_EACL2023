, Whether using a film camera or a digital camera, you always want extras.
 If it needs a certain type of batteries, or a type of charger, bring it. The room that they take is minimal and the photographic opportunities that you could miss are infinite.
 Photography is all about lighting and its uses.
 You will want to have a few group shots even if not everyone is in them.
 If you aren't well known, make sure that you have a few people who know you there. Otherwise, you may just find yourself arrested!!!
