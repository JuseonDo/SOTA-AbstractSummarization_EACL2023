 His first Pokémon will be a Spearow of level 18, so it would be wise to have a Rock or Electric-type Pokémon as the first in your party. After this is completed, you must clear all of the trainers on Nugget Bridge, including the final man who offers you a position in Team Rocket.;
,,,, Shut the game off and resume where you saved at the last trainer you fought (This is not part of the glitch, and if you already know which trainer not to fight you don't have to battle him and shut it off. The video link should help clarify this but if you are unable to access it you will find the saving technique useful).
 This is harder than one would think because it will teleport away from you on its first turn. It is hard to find, and throwing a Poke Ball on your first turn and crossing your fingers is basically your only option. However, once you've caught Abra you will be able to move on to the next step.
 Now is the time to approach the trainer who is hiding in the grass, who you did not battle before.
 Save your game right here, because this next step can be tricky.
 You will take a step down toward the trainer, but the start menu will appear instead of the exclamation point above his head. Teleport back to the Pokémon Center with Abra, and walk back up Nugget Bridge. At this point your start menu will be disabled, but do not despair as this is part of the glitch.
, Then walk back up Nugget Bridge and your start menu will appear.
