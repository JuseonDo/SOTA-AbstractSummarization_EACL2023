 This will make you a bit more tired, and you will get to sleep earlier. Don't get up too early, because if you have anywhere to go later, you may be too tired to go to those places.;
, Open your advent calendar if you have one, and do your normal morning routine.
 Some great ones are: Elf, A Christmas Carol (Scrooge), The Polar Express, Its a Wonderful Life, etc.
 Offer to do the simple jobs, like peeling potatoes or seasoning the vegetables. They will definitely appreciate your help, and you'll get to enjoy a nice dinner that you helped make.
 If you type in 'Santa tracker NORAD' in Google and click on the website called 'noradsanta.com', you can look at where it is midnight, and which countries are ready for Christmas! If you don't feel like using NORAD, there is also a Google Santa Tracker! Just search 'Google Santa Tracker' on Google.
 You should aim to not have any food three hours before you go to bed.
 If you'd like to, you can add in some lavender oil or petals on top to help relax you.
 Then go downstairs and watch another Christmas film with your family. If you wanted to, you could also get some fancy Christmas themed bowls and fill them with quality treats and celebrations. Then, put these out for people to eat on Christmas Day.
 If you can't get to sleep, then try to relax your body and count backwards from 1000. Or, you could try the old trick of counting sheep.
 You don't want to look incredibly scruffy in the Christmas photos, if your parents happen to take some this year.
 Open your presents, spend time with your family, and have an all around good time!
