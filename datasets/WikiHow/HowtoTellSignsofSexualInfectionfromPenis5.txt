 If your partner is a woman, there are certain tests she should get on a regular basis. If your partner is a man, he should be screened for certain STIs.These tests can tell you if you or your partner have an STI, allowing you to take proper precautions and to seek treatment. This is especially important because, as mentioned above, many STIs do not cause obvious symptoms.


These guidelines are just that — a guide. You should discuss all testing and risk factors with your healthcare provider, and they will help you adjust screening accordingly.
Make sure your partner is also tested and treated accordingly.
 Men who have sex with men should be tested at least yearly, if not more frequently., Having multiple sex partners puts you at an increased risk for STIs.
