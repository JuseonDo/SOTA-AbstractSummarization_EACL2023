 When meeting face to face with clients, always be there at least 10 minutes before the meeting. This makes the client feel important, as though you have blocked out extra time for their needs.
 Grab the company logo and use it on folders, documents and PowerPoints to give a professional appearance.
 Include a proposal, company gear, such as notepads, postcards or folders and your contact information.
 Getting to know the customer both personally and professionally will help you to ensure that they feel comfortable with your relationship. Take copious notes about birthdays, family, vacations and milestones.
 Remember that even though you may prefer a look or strategy, it is up to the client how they want something to turn out. Note changes and follow up with questions and positive statements, rather than getting negative.
 One of the biggest ways to alienate a client is to charge them for something that they weren't aware of or send a surprise invoice. Let them know when the billing will happen and what will be included.
