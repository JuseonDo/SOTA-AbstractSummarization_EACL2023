have a friend use a tailor's measuring tape to measure your body.

measure the circumference of your hips if you are a woman.

 The measuring tape should be soft so that it can fit around curves. You can do this yourself but it will be more accurate if someone else takes the measurements. Measure your neck and waist first.
 If you are a man, measure the circumference around your navel area instead.
