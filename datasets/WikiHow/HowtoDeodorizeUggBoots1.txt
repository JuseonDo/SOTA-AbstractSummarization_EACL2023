 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of each ingredient will be plenty.Both baking soda and cornstarch have odor-absorbing properties.


If you can't find cornstarch, use cornflour instead. Don't use cornmeal, it is not the same thing.;
, Tea tree oil not only smells fresh, but is antibacterial as well.
 Be sure to break up any lumps or clumps. If you are using essential oil, make sure that it is evenly distributed throughout the baking soda and cornstarch.
 Try to use the same amount for each boot. If you washed your Uggs earlier, make sure that they are completely dry first.
 This will distribute the mixture through the inside of the boot. Be sure to tilt the boot back and forth so that the mixture gets into the toe area as well.
 For very stinky Uggs, leave the powder inside for up to 24 hours.
 If the shoes still stink, repeat the process.Keep in mind that some boots may be beyond salvaging., You should aim to deodorize your Ugg boots more frequently than you clean them.
