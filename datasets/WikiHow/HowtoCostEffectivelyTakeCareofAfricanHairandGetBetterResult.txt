don't use any chemical treatment: any chemical treatment that changes your hair will also at best weaken it and possibly kill it.

@summary
make simple hair styling: styling that tugs at your hair and on glued-in extensions, tight braids, tight cornrows, and hard gel hairstyles.

@summary
minimize or better still, eliminate heat exposure.

@summary
shampoo only to clean your hair from dirt and old skin cells.

@summary
keep hair moisturized.

@summary
wet your hair thoroughly and apply a palm's sized amount of shampoo (paul mitchell, matrix or motions suggested) on the each side of the head and lather well.

@summary
gently comb out your hair with a wide tooth comb or what most people know as afro comb.

@summary
'co-wash'.

@summary
for best results, simply rinse the hair well with warm water, and apply conditioner to the hair, starting about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) away from the scalp, and smooth it through to the ends.

@summary
for after-wash care, begin with towel drying (pat your hair dry - don't rub, it causes hair to frizz).

@summary
maintenance: every night, before bed, oil your scalp, brush you hair and wrap it.

 Do not use products that contain sulfates (natural oil-stripping detergents), silicone, alcohols or glycerol (hair drying and damaging chemicals) - this eliminates about 96% of available African hair care products quite apart from the poisons manufactured within Africa.;
, They all severely stress your hair.
 Heat removes moisture and can fry your hair irreparably. It is preferably better to leave hair to dry naturally, rather than blowing heat.
 Shampoo washes away oil which protects your hair. When shampooing, apply it only to the scalp, and lather very gently. After washing hair, just gently squeeze it with a towel. No pulling or roughness.
 African hair needs moisture and deep conditioning, especially when exposed to heat appliances like blow dryers and flat irons. A conditioner is a cream that is applied to the hair to smooth the cuticle, soften the hair, add sheen, and restore moisture. Oils like jojoba oil can help as well. Moisturize everything but the scalp.
 Don't plop it all on top of your head. Rinse and repeat.
 Don't pull out any hair. As you comb, apply conditioner through your hair and massage the scalp (Affirm, Matrix or Motions are suggested). Put a plastic shower cap over your head so ALL of your hair is in it. Leave it on for about 30 minutes and rinse your hair out. Comb it out as you rinse ( using slightly cooler than lukewarm water adds natural shine to the hair).
 Conditioner washing is washing your hair with a lightweight moisturizing conditioner, eliminating the shampoo step which can be very drying, especially to chemically damaged hair. Many with damaged relaxed hair wash daily.
 Apply more to the ends if they are dry. Avoid applying conditioner to the scalp unless it is dry. Rinse out conditioner very well.
 Then comb out your hair (this involves a lot of combing and brushing) and work in a heat protection product. Blow dry it on WARM setting - the hot setting will dry out and damage your hair. As you dry, work in a smoothing serum. Paul Mitchell works - and brush it downwards (root to tip) with a circular brush. When you are done, separate it into four large sections (right front, left front, right back, left back and bangs if you have then).
 Repeat the above process once every week (or two). Get a trim every 3-4 months.
