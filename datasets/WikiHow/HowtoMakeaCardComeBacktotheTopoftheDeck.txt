, As you’re talking, perform a double lift — that is, pretend you are taking just the top card from the top of the deck, but actually pick up the first two cards. Do this without showing that you have two cards.


The critical part here is to remove the two cards so smoothly that the participant believes you are showing them only the top card.
 In actual fact, it will be the second card that they're seeing but they will think it's the first card.
 When they have assured you they have the card memorized, put the cards back on the top of the deck, and make a big show of removing the top card putting it into the middle of the deck. Now the once second card is on top.


Obviously, don’t let the person see the face of the card!
