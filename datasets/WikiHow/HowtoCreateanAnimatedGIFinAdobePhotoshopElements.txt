 A good size to practice with is 300 by 300 pixels at 72 dpi. You can select a transparent background, as it creates a cool effect, however you don't have to.;
, Then, proceed to draw your frames, one on each layer, using whatever animation technique your little heart desires. Just make sure that your first frame is the lowest layer, your last frame is the layer on top, and all the layers in between are in chronological order.
 This is important!

"GIF" should be the default setting, but if it's not, change it so that you've got "GIF" selected.


, An internet window should pop up and display your animation. If it looks okay, exit out of the web browser and click "Save."
