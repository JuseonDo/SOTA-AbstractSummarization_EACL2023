Consider a pink blush if you have fair skin.
Choose a peach blush if your skin is medium tone.
Try a plum shade if you have darker toned skin.
 Apply dark, shimmering metallic shades to make your eyes stand out.


Avoid light silvers or grays, even if you opted for all-silver accessories. If you want to keep the all-silver look, opt for medium to darker shades of gray.
Go with either dark bronzes or coal grays if you accessorized with silver and gold accessories.
Try adding some variety into your look with a color eye shadow. Stick with blue tones. Think dark blues, eggplant violets, and deep turquoises.



You may add liquid glitter liner over the black liner to give your eyes a bit more sparkle.
, Instead, use violet-red colors like mauve or pink tones.
