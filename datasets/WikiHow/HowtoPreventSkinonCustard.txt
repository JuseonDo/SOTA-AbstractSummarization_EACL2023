 Follow the directions exactly. At some point in whatever custard recipe you are using, you will be asked to cook the custard.;
, If the custard is allowed to set, a skin will form. Keep the custard stirred well with a wire whisk to prevent a skin from forming.
 You can do this with a strainer or a slatted spoon. You may notice a thin skin as you are cooking or when you are ready to pour.
 If you are adding the custard to other ingredients in a special custard recipe, follow the directions of the recipe for when to pour the custard.
 The wrap should be bigger than the size of the dish.
 Use your hands to lightly press the cling wrap or waxed paper, so that it is actually touching the top of the custard. It is important that the wrap or paper be placed directly on the surface of the custard mixture, not just above it.
 Refrigerate the custard in an airtight container. Leave the cling wrap or waxed paper in place until the custard is served.
 There should be no skin on the custard.
 The sugar will work toward keeping the skin away.
