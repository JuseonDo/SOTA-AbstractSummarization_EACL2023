 If you want the two sides to be different, then buy a half a yard of each color and/or texture of fabric.;
, Draw a template to this measurement on paper, to place over the fabric. Cut out the template, then pin it to the fabric. Cut out a piece of fabric based on the template. Remove the template and cut the other piece. Make sure that the two sides of the pillow cut out are the same size.
 You'll be sewing the inner part of the pillow first, then turning it inside out. This ensures both neatness of stitches and strength of the sewing. Pin together in readiness for stitching.
 Start sewing. As you sew around the edges, remove the pins from each stitched section.
 This leaves a hole for adding the stuffing of the pillow shortly.
 The sides you want to be on show are now on the outside.
 Feed the stuffing through the open section of the pillow.
 Be sure to knot it off tightly, to prevent unraveling. You can either finish here or add embellishments to the pillow as desired.
 Put the pillow wherever you want it.
