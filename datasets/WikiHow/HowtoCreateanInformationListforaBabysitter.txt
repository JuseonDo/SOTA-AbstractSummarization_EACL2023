 Not every child is the same. Run things you put on the list by your husband or wife, or make it with them! You don't want to find out you put something you shouldn't have on the list!;
, Start with rituals and special needs your child may have. Do they need to take medicine?How about allergies? Make sure to include the child's bedtime rituals, they might try to convince the babysitter of something else!Write down anything vital to your child, the babysitter shouldn't have to deal with to many surprises.
 You never know what could happen. Make sure you are CLEAR about the things they are not allowed and are allowed to eat. Both the babysitter and your child. It can save a lot of grief.
 Babysitters with a license will be trained to keep the door closed on anyone they do not know. If you know someone might be coming by, make sure to include this on the list. Include the names and phone numbers of neighbours (and if they are to let them in if they come to your door).
 Whether it's a blanket, stuffed animal, or something that would comfort them.
 Most people know 911, but should they do in case of fire? Make sure to include these numbers.
 If you don't know them or too well, advise them to allow the answering machine to do the work.
