 If you don’t have a lot of indoor space, choose the starter vegetables that have a long maturation time.


Place your planting trays in a south, sunny window.






Water frequently so that they don’t dry out.






Start to harden your seedlings a few weeks before they go into the ground. You can simply open a window and allow the air to blow on them, or you can place them outside in a protected area for a few hours each day.

, If this is your first garden, be sure to pick a location that gets a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight a day.


Pull weeds and clear all debris from your garden plot.
 If you don’t have a tiller, you can use a shovel to turn over the dirt. Spread compost over the soil; work the compost into the soil after a few days.
, You should also mark each row with an identifier of some sort. You can write the name of the vegetable on a Popsicle stick or small plastic stake and place it at one end of the row.
 Don’t allow the soil to dry out.
 If you see evidence of nibbling, you should protect your garden with a fence or netting.
 Mulch will help keep down the weeds and keep moisture in the soil. Leaves and grass clippings make great mulch.
 If your space is limited, you can choose to plant compact varieties.
