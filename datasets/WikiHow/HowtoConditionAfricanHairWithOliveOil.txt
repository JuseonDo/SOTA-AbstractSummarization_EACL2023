 This reduces shrinking and tangling. .;
, Sulfate is bad, it gives hair lather and strips it of its natural oils.
 Put plastic cap over your hair and leave on for 20-30 minutes.
, Don’t use white vinegar as it contains less vitamins to give your hair that shine we all love and need. The smell will last until hair is dry. Put ½ vinegar and ½ water in a spray bottle (you can also use a cup). Shake well. Spray on the section in your hair and not all over like oil sheen and spritz.
 Hooded dryers are the best for your hair. You can also wrap your hair and air dry it for a while, but some can't do that since their hair can tangle up if they are housekeeping or attending other duties. It takes a while for it to dry completely and your hair won't get as straight. BEFORE you expose your hair to any type of heat, spray it with some heat protection and let it dry a bit.
