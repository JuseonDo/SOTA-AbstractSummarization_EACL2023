 Their head. Who knows why, but it exposes this as it attacks. Generally it will approach from behind you. Keep your Gummi-Ship low on the screen, so you can note where the head pops up. It generally appears accompanied by a burst of flame, so as soon as you see that, begin aiming. A fast Gummi-Ship is your only hope of reaching the head before it hits you.
 Unless you damage it, it will just keep coming back.
