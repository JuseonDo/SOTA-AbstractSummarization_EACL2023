 This will make your muscles looser and the tests more accurate. You are also less likely to injure yourself if you have warmed up.
 You are preparing for a Sit-and-Reach test.
 Have your friend move the box so that its side is against the bottom of your feet.
 The wall can help you to sit up very straight if it is an uncomfortable position. Place the beginning of the yardstick at the tip of your outstretched hands. Have a friend tape the yardstick into place at this neutral starting position.
 Do not use a lot of force as this could be harmful.
 Reach 3 times and record 3 measurements. Take the farthest reach as your flexibility measurement.
