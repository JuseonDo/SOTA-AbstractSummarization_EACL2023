 Place the eyelash curler near the center of your lashes, and gently squeeze for 15 seconds. Repeat to your other eye.
 You don't want a big glob of make-up, as this will cake on your eyelashes unattractively. You only need a little bit on the bristles of the wand -- you can always add more later.


Wipe off the excess on a tissue, leaving only a thin layer.
 Do this a couple of times. Make sure you get your bottom lashes too, even though they seem "less important."

, Allow the first coat of mascara to dry.
 Layering 2 different mascaras together will really open your eyes, since they are both formulated differently. If you don't have more than one mascara, you can just use the same one for two layers.


If you are using two mascaras, make sure each coat is lighter than you would normally use for one.
 This won't take long, but keeping your eyes open will ensure the lashes stay open and separated.
 Dab off any excess moisturizer on your hand, then gently swipe the areas around your eyes that have mascara marks.
 This will get rid of mascara clumps and also separate your eyelashes so they are not stuck together.


Do not use a pin or toothpick to separate your eyelashes; it is incredibly dangerous. Even if you think you are not clumsy, there is no need to take the risk.
 Found in most pharmacies and make-up aisles, make-up remover is essential for healthy eyelashes.


Squeeze a pea-sized amount of makeup remover on a cotton pad and gently press down on your eyelashes to remove the mascara. If you're not getting black marks on the pad, you're not taking it off thoroughly enough.
If you want, use the eyelash comb to comb through your lashes again, to make sure there is not any remaining mascara
If your makeup remover requires rinsing, carefully splash your eyes with clean water, then wipe them on a towel.
