 Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper., Either do by hand or with an electric mixer., Mix into a soft dough using a flat-bladed butter knife., Knead gently and quickly for 30 seconds, using only the fingertips., Using a heart shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookie shapes., Prick a few holes into each cookie with a fork. Sprinkle with sugar., Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until firm and lightly golden., Let sit on the sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to complete the cooling., Store in an airtight container.

For a special touch, decorate the cookies. Melt white or milk chocolate. Dip half of the cookie into chocolate to cover. Let set. Yum!
