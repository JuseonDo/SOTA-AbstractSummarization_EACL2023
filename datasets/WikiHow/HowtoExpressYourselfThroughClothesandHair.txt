 Rock, pop, or the blues, r&b and so on. After you're done deciding, make a list of all the different types of music you listen to. However, if you only like to listen to one artist or one band in that genre, feel free to write the person's/band's name down instead.;
, If you're not sure, ask someone. Could be your teacher, family, or friends. After you're done add this to the list.
 (ex: your country of origin, nature, actions, popular quotes, etc.)

, Anything that is related on your list and you like it, get it. Don't spend too much money. You're going to need some more later on of course, especially if your saving up for something special. Again, don't end up spending money on something that's not you. After you're done buying things that represent you, move on to the next step.
 Decorate, decorate, decorate. Find things you could put on your shirt. Rhinestones, ribbon, buttons, glitter, write stuff down with fabric marker as long as it is you. Don't make it too much though.
, Everyone wants a hairstyle they like, but it has to suit you as well and go with your personality. This could be bangs, layers, simple style, trims, short hair, long hair, coloured hair! Anything. Before you do so, go to a professional hair stylist and ask if it will look good on you. Also pay close attention to if you really like it, it suits you and looks good. Don't cut it yourself, unless you've done it before and loved it. As for colouring your hair, go with your favourite colour, something that you'd like, could be multicoloured, maybe even streaks. If you don't want to cut or colour, find some hairstyles that you like and do them to school or to the mall, or a party.
 If you're into music, do something funky. Don't cake makeup all over your face if you don't feel like it's necessary - you could get loads of acne and bumps all over your face. If you don't want to use a lot of makeup, just moisturise your face daily and add some mascara and lip gloss.
