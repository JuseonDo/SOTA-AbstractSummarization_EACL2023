 Are you looking to date them or do you want to get some new friends who live near you?;
, Dig through the "Suggestions" section which can be found on the right column.
 Does anyone seem appealing or interesting to you?

, A little blue and white screen will pop up saying "Add As A Friend?"

, This option can be found on the bottom right of the little screen. Adding a message makes the person more likely to accept.
 Say something like "Hey, I'm . I heard that you were in my area and I just wanted to say hello."

, Don't be shy! The worst that can happen is they will reject your request.
 You can write on their wall or you can talk to them via pop-up chat.
 Be sure to meet in a public area like the mall or an amusement park for the first time and not one of your houses.
