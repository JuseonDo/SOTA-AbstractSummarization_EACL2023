 Most people rinse rice for sanitary purposes, and to get rid of the starch dust. Starch is what causes rice to become sticky and clump together. If you cannot bear to eat rice without washing it, then rinse it once or twice—but don't rinse so much that the water runs clear. You still want some of that starch left.;
, Some people find that letting the rice soak in water helps it become stickier in the end. Try soaking it for 30 minutes to 4 hours. Drain the water once the rice has finished soaking.
 Using more water than you actually need will help make the ricer stickier and clumpier.








Consider adding a dash of salt. This will give the rice some flavor and make it taste less bland.
 Try to use the short-grain rice variety, if you can. Short-grain rice tends to have a higher starch content than medium or long-grain rice, which makes it slightly more sticky.









Both jasmine and basmati are considered to be medium-grain.
 Do not cover the pot with a lid.
 At this point, you can place the lid on the pot.
 You may notice some steam holes in the rice.
 If you make it a day or two ahead of time, your rice will be extra sticky. If you do plan on waiting that long, however, you might want to cover the rice and leave it in the fridge so that it doesn't dry out or spoil.
 Transfer the rice to a serving plate. If you want, you can fluff it a little bit with a fork to make it less clumpy.
