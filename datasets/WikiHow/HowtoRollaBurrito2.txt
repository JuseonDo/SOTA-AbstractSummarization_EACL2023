 Again, this step is essential. You can microwave your tortilla, steam it, or put it through a panini press to get the desired heat and moisture. Whichever works best for you.
 Place a smaller amount of burrito filling directly into the center of the tortilla.
 Either the tortilla sides will meet, or the contents of the burrito will tell you when you should stop.
 This is much like the tuck motion you performed rolling a larger burrito.
 Your smaller burrito has been successfully rolled.
 This provides insulation to keep the burrito warm; helps compact the burrito even more; and gives the person eating the burrito a mold to help keep the burrito together.
