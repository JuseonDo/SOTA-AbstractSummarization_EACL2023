, Have a relaxed session over a cup of coffee. Analyse your problem for any possible solutions and if you have found one, be happy and work to solve your problem.
 When we are low or unable to figure out things we usually expect some help from the ones who are really close to us. It can be a family member. (elder or younger) Though these set of people may not totally help you come out of your problem but surely discussions with them will really sooth or calm you. They are emotional boosters. Respect their decision.
 As they say "a friend in need is a friend in deed". We usually get along with friends very well with no inhibitions, that makes us rely on them for the solution. But a friend is the only person who can direct you to realities. If you are wrong it makes them no hesitation on saying so. A friend will always guide you in right direction. So accept the fact told by your friend.
 When we are in a state of confusion we always find ourselves emotionally correct no matter how wrong we are. This leads us to expect a positive answer form the person with whom share the problem. So come out of the perception that the solution will favour you. Be bold to accept the truth.
, By giving complete figure of the situation you are indeed helping yourself get the right answer.
 When you have finished your version of saying the problem give time to the opposite person to analyse it and come with a conclusion. Do not interrupt in between.(As a good listener is a good speaker)
