 They will take even more advantage of you than they already are. Be calm, or at least act calm. Assume they have no qualms about killing you; it's quite likely that they don't.;
, Never forget that you are being held at gunpoint, and could be killed at any moment. You don't want this theft to escalate into homicide.
 After all, which is more important to you: your life or your wallet?

, Take some time to calm yourself down.
