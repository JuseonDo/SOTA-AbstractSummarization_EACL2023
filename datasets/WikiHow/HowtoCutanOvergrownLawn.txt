 Often these will grow taller than the grass and are easier to remove individually.;
, If you cut the grass back too severely the first time, it may die off. Instead, cut back over a period of a week or so to gradually reduce its height.
 A lawn that is cut back a lot will benefit from a boost of fertiliser to help it get growing again.
 Too many severe cutting sessions will deplete it of its strength before winter dormancy.
