 If you do not have one, you will need to make one before beginning.;
, Search one. Once your results have come up, edit your requirements. For example: free shipping, buy it now, brand new, in the US only.
 Setting the prices you are willing to pay is of great importance. For example: $1 - $10.
 For certain searches, this may be well worth changing out of the default "Best Match" setting. However, if you are getting too many products that are not what you want, feel free to change it back.
 When you find the cheapest one, check it out. Make sure it is from a top rated seller, and read the feedback. Also make sure the item image was taken in the seller's own home.
, If you don't think it will be a good deal, look at the next cheapest item.
