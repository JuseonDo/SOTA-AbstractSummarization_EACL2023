, Rub the pieces into the flour.
,, Stir with the fork.
 Use your hands to roll into a ball of dough.
 Place in the refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes.
 Line the baking sheets with parchment paper in readiness for use.
 Roll out on a surface sprinkled with flour, to prevent sticking. Roll the dough to a thickness about 5mm/ 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm)., Either use a circle cookie cutter or the open end of an average-sized glass.


Leftover dough can be rolled into a ball and re-rolled to cut more cookies from.
, Bake for 10-12 minutes.
 Let sit for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then remove and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack before icing.
 Draw a spiral design with the white writing icing.
 Pipe the icing evenly from the center right out to the edge of the cookie.
 Starting at the center, drag the toothpick to the outer edge. Aim to do this about 6-8 times around the whole cookie, dividing it into equal pie slice shapes.


Make any other adjustments using the toothpick that you think will enhance the look of the web.
Consider making small spiders for a more realistic look and a touch to the cookies.
 When finished, you'll have a batch of cobweb cookies that look tasty and intricately detailed.
 Ways to serve include:


Simply pile into a basket, web side facing upward.
Pierce little holes in the cookies and string them up on a thin piece of twine to make cobweb cookie bunting. Hang in place.
Use the cookies as part of a decorative food setting, perhaps including edible spider candies, edible insect candies, etc.
