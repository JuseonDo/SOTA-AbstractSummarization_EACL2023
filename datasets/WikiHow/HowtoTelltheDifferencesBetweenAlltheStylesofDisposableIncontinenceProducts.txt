@summary
try to determine just how much wetness you tend to go through on any single given day.

@summary
propose to yourself that you might not even need a disposable incontinence product at all, if you aren't leaking that much.

@summary
look around on some incontinent companies websites, to see just what is available, especially while reading the product descriptions under most companies "incontinence products" sections.

@summary
determine your weight on a scale, by weighing yourself or the one who's been proposed to be wearing the incontinent garment.

@summary
look around at the stores.

@summary
look for incontinence pads and/or belted incontinent products, if you find the wearer doesn't wet all that much and/or all that often.

@summary
determine just how much other coverage you'll need, in the style of diaper the wearer will be using.

@summary
look for what types of diapers to use at night, or if you find that the wearer wets their diapers heavily.

@summary
look on the market for disposable waterproof pads which can give the wearer some extra protection that will ensure them that no urine will soak through and end up on the bed or changing surface when they don't want it to.

@article
 Not all people will need a disposable incontinence product to begin with, if they only tend to leak a little bit. A few drops of wetness is normal to expect in any given adult.;
, All that you might even need might be a feminine pad that can double as a wetness "catcher" when you don't need all that much. And females aren't the only people who can afford to use them, males can to, as long as they tailor it to their own "urine catching area" near the front "zone" of their underpants.
 Most often times, you'll find those that are pads, those that are pull-up styled, along with those you put on much like that of a baby-like disposable diaper (those with tabs and such).
 This can further help determine just what's available to the wearer.
 Most stores might carry a large selection of types, along with a wide variety of brands, but since stores vary in what they carry, call the store first.
 They can be useful in these two situations.
 While most diapers are pull-up styled (with or without extra-protection/better-fit tapes), most can get away with wearing these during the day. And most of these brands can be fit to either gender (unless the outside of the package describes otherwise). Depends has come out with gender-based incontinence products that look and work much like those specifically for that gender, so be careful when noticing/purchasing these products.
 Most companies provide baby-like (tape-diapered styled) disposable incontinence diapers that get put on. These diapers are mostly marketed as "for Maximum Protection" and most can be worn at night without much need to be changed during the night.
