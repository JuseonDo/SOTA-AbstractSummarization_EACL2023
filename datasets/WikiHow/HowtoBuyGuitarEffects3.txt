@summary
by and large, delay effects split the signal into two identical signals and momentarily hold back one while allowing the other to play in real time.
@article
 The signals are mixed back into one at the output. Usually you can control the length of the delay and the amount of the signal that is affected versus the part that stays "dry" (unaffected). This latter control—found on most effects—is usually called the level control.
