 Lay the window sash onto a work table and cover the damaged pane with a rag. Wear work gloves and goggles while doing this. Tap the center of the covered pane with a hammer and pull out the remaining shards.;
, The putty might need to be softened with a heat gun, which you should hold 1 inch (2.5 cm) away.
 These are the grooves in which the glass sits.
 Then, brush them with an exterior primer.
 You can warm and soften a handful of putty by kneading it in your hands.
 Apply even pressure on all sides as you wiggle it into place. There should be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) of putty between the face of the glass and the rabbet.
 Use a putty knife to slide a glazier's point into the center of each side of the pane, sticking the point into the wood.
,, Press it firmly against the rabbets.



Start at the top right corner and hold the blade at a 45-degree angle to the glass. The tip of the blade should point at the top edge of the corner, with the knife's corner on the glass.
Push your index finger downward on the blade and scrape downward.
 If you can see the underside of the putty from the opposite side of the glass, you need to scrape closer to the rabbet.
 Then, use a clean rag to wipe away any putty film that's left on the glass.
 Overlap it about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) onto the glass.
