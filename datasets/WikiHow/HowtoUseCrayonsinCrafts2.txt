 Get a stiff piece of paper or card, canvas-board or thin sheet of wood, that your collage will be glued on. This is your base.
 You can draw a picture, some shapes, or download pre-drawn stencils from the Internet, to act as a guide.
 Apply a thick layer of glue to fill up the outline, then press the crayons lengthwise into the glue. You can use whole crayons or broken pieces, or you can use crayon shavings.
 You can also glue buttons, crumpled balls of coloured tissue paper, glitter, feathers, and ribbons to your base or as a border.
 Thick layers of glue will need more time to dry.
