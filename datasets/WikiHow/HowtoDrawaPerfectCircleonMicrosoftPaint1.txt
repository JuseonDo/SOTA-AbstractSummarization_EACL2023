, This tool is the oval button in the toolbar in the “Shapes” section.
, Starting from where you click, the Ellipse tool will make a perfect circle instead of the normal ellipse.


Before you release the mouse button, you can drag the mouse to adjust the size of the circle.
 You now have a perfect circle!


This method is great for creating concentric circles, because you can see the size of the circle as you draw it.
