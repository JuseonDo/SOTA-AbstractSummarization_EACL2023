let's start building a monster computer that will excel at distributed computing tasks.

@summary
get a good motherboard.

@summary
put in enough ram to do this stuff.

@summary
fit as many processors as your motherboard allows, and make them expensive, powerful ones.

@summary
for extreme seti performance you will need a powerful gpu, get the latest high end graphics card, or ideally more than one (nvidia is better at this)!,

@summary
install an operating system with the least amount of overhead.

@summary
download and install the boinc software that seti@home and the other good causes runs on.

@summary
,

@summary
get the url of the project you want to join (eg.

@summary
start crunching those seti (or other good cause) packets.

@summary
good luck!

, Get one with support for plenty of RAM, but crucially, seek multi-processor support. The more processors you jam into the computer, the more simultaneous tasks you can undertake. Also, for the fastest upgrade path, get one with 64 bit support.
 Nowadays, you can get up to 128GB of RAM on consumer platforms (LGA 2011-V3). Better make it the fastest RAM (that your chipset/CPU clock speed will allow).
 The more expensive and powerful the better. Server processors are better in some categories than normal processors.
 Its trickier configuring the Bionic Manager to get all the cards/cores to work at the same time but if you do, this will blow away any CPU on the market. Period.
 If you want to avoid learning a new operating system, use one in which you are comfortable installing and using. Operating systems in order of least overhead:


LimeTech unRaid (If you want to run multiple Operating Systems)
Windows Server 2016/2013 r2
MacOS X (Snow Leopard)
Windows 10
