 Look for silk, knit, or cotton blouses. You can choose a fitted shirt with a collar in a standard color, like white, or you can opt for a more stylish design in a brighter color. Avoid distracting patterns or low-cut blouses, however. Your top can be stylish, but it should also be conservative.
 Pencil skirts are the most traditional, but other simple cuts, like A-line, may also work. Look for subdued colors like black, gray, or dark brown, and avoid slits that extend above the knee.
 Dress slacks often have a glossy lining along the interior and may either have pleated or plain fronts. Look for trouser cut slacks in subdued colors like black or gray.
 Jackets are optional for women, but they can go a long way in creating a polished, professional look.
 Opt for closed-toe pumps and skip strappy heels and peep toes.
 You may be able to get away without it in some offices, but it is a part of most traditional business styles.
 A conservative bracelet or simple earrings can keep you looking your best, but too much sparkle looks inappropriate.
 Only wear enough to smooth out your skin. It should not be noticeable.
 Strong scents can be over-powering in a confined office space.
