 It is preferable to buy at least 250mls as it will be used up quickly.;
,,, Two or three good squirts usually works, and if the pest is drenched in oil, it will die immediately. It works a little differently from fly spray, in that it kills pests quickly if you give them a good drenching with the oil.
 Although non-toxic to spray and handle generally, it is toxic if swallowed. It is also a good idea to wear gloves if you are sensitive to essential oils.
