, Scrub the potatoes clean with a vegetable scrubbing brush and cool water, then cut them into wedges. You do not need to peel them, as the skins are part of their appeal.
 Stir the butter until it melts. Have the potatoes ready. You will be frying them first; this will help give them a crispier texture as well as cut down on the baking time.
 Add the potatoes and toss them until they are covered in the oil and butter mixture. Cook them for 10 minutes, tossing them from time to time. Don't worry if they still look raw by the time you are done.
 Add the salt and pepper straight to the skillet. Cover the skillet with a lid, then shake it a few times to toss the potatoes inside.
 Don't clump or pile the potatoes. If the baking sheet is too small, it would be better to set the extra potatoes aside and bake them in a separate batch.
 Put the baking sheet with the potatoes into the oven and bake them for 10 minutes. Flip the potatoes over using a spatula, then bake them for another 10 minutes. The steak fries are ready when they are golden brown and crispy.
 They go great with steak as well as other dishes, including hamburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches.
