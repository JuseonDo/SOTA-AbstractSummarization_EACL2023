 You will want something like a ball head that you would attach to a tripod. This is not a quick release attachment. That will not work.
 You can find these at your local garden and construction supply store; a place like Lowe's or Home Depot (US). It will be something along the lines of a 4 inch (10.2Â cm) vise.
 This makes it easier to get a 360 degree of movement and improves its range of motion. Mark it with whatever you have for reference.
 This is where you are going to attach the tripod head.,, If you need to, take apart the vise.,, You may want to add some type of metal adhesive. Or, if you are good with tools, use a soldering tool around where the stud meets the metal of the bench top vise. This will provide for a more secure connection than just adhesive.,
