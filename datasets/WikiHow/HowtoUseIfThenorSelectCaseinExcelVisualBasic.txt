@summary
note that the if...then...else statement executes a group of statements based on the value of an expression, and the select case statement executes one of several of statements based on the value of an expression.

@summary
copy the above code into word, or a similar application, and replace all the "#** " with nothing(s).

Sample Macro Using If...Then...Else Statement

Sub Using_IF()
Dimension the variable.
Dim x As Integer
' Place a value in x.
x = Int(Rnd * 2000)
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 10.
If x <= 10 Then
' Display a message box.
MsgBox "X is <=10"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 100 and greater than 10.
ElseIf x <= 100 And x > 10 Then
MsgBox "X is <=100 and > 10"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 1000 and greater than 100.
ElseIf x <= 1000 And x > 100 Then
MsgBox "X is <=1000 and > 100"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 2000 and greater than 1000.
ElseIf x <= 2000 And x > 1000 Then
MsgBox "X is <= 2000 and > 1000"
If none of the above tests returned true.
Else
MsgBox "X does not fall within the range"
End If
End Sub



Sample Macro Using Select Case Statement

Sub Using_Case()
' Dimension the variable.
Dim x As Integer
' Place a value in x.
x = Int(Rnd * 2000)
' Start the Select Case structure.
Select Case x
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 10.
Case Is <= 10
' Display a message box.
MsgBox "X is <=10"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 100 and greater than 10.
Case 11 To 100
MsgBox "X is <=100 and > 10"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 1000 and greater than 100.
Case 101 To 1000
MsgBox "X is <=1000 and > 100"
' Test to see if x less than or equal to 2000 and greater than 1000.
Case 1001 To 2000
MsgBox "X is <= 2000 and > 1000"
' If none of the above tests returned true.
Case Else
MsgBox "X does not fall within the range"
End Select
End Sub



, You can use Excel to accomplish this if you like.,, Paste the REPLACE(d) ALL code into the new module that pops up and separate the two macros with a single return line.,
