Editing the code will not affect editing notes in the Evernote software.
,, This will give the site permission to review, create and update notes, tags, and notebooks.The site is well-regarded on the Internet, so these permissions are safe.


You can revoke this access at any time by going to your Authorized Applications settings on Evernote.com. Just click “revoke access” next to “ENML Editor.”

,,,,, Evernote allows the use of many HTML tags as well as in-line CSS style sheets.Use the the Evernote Markup Language developer’s guide to learn which elements are allowed.
 Now that you’re editing the HTML, you can set a new solid color or a background image.


Find the <en-note> tag.
After “en-note”, hit space and type style=”background:#95DEFF;”>.
The line should now read: <en-note style=”background:#95DEFF;”>.
To use an image instead of a solid color, add this after en-note instead: style=”background-image:url(‘yourURL’);”>.
The line should now read: <en-note style=”background-image:url(‘yourURL’);”> where “yourURL” is the full path to the image.
 You’ll want to see what your note will look like before you save your changes. The preview will appear in new browser window in the online version of Evernote.
 If you are satisfied with your changes, save your work.


If the changes are accepted, you’ll see “Your note has been saved! Click here to check the results in Evernote.”
If there are any errors in your code, you’ll see a message that says “There is an error in your ENML code.” You’ll need to fix the errors before you can save the note.
 This will sync and save the changes you made online with the local version of your note.
