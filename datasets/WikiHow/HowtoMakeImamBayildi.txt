 Some recipes often leave portions of the skin on, so peel roughly. To make them attractive, peel long strips leaving a 0.5 cm 1/5 inch gap between each peel. Sprinkle with salt and put aside.;
, Alternatively you can brush with oil and bake at 175C / 345F until just tender, or deep fry. Put aside once cooked.
 Ideally the onions should brown only slightly if at all. Add spices (if desired) and garlic, cook for another few minutes until the spices smell fragrant. Add tomatoes, chopped paprika peppers and season with salt to taste. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes, then add lemon juice, parsley and sugar (if desired).
 You will need to split the eggplants from top to tail to make a boat like shape, but aim to avoid breaking all the way through.
 Bake 20-25 minutes in the 175C / 345 oven until the vegetables just start to break down.
