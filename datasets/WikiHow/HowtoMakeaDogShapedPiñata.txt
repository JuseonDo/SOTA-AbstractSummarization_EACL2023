 You can make this any size you want, but it is recommended to make it smaller.
 Do the same thing with the plastic bags. This time, make result bigger and tape it up so that it stays stiff., This will be the legs. You can even make a tail too!,, The paste is made up of one part water and one part flour. You can start by mixing one cup of flour and one cup of water, continue adding the same proportion if you need more paste. You can add more water if it gets too thick. The paste should have a gluey thickness to it. If the paste appears to be lacking in viscosity, leave it for 5 to 10 minutes and it should thicken up., Make sure that you have a lot of strips. Even if you have more than enough, it is still better than having less., Directly apply the soggy strip onto the dog. Continue this until you have one full layer covering the dog.,, You can choose to add more layers if you think that the shell isn't hard enough., Make sure not to cut through the plastic bags. Pull your piñata ends off the dog.


Note! Request adult supervision if necessary.
 Either fill both sides evenly or just fill one side up.,, You could paint it, glue tissue paper to it, or maybe even put glitter on it!
