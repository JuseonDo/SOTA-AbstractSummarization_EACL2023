 If you have an administrator account that is separate from your personal account on your Mac, you can access your profile setting from there.
 If a lock symbol appears, click on it and enter the administrator log on information again. Then click the “Users & Groups” icon.
 Click the Reset Password button, follow the prompts, and enter a new password. When you or the user of the account logs in after the password reset, they’ll have to update or reset the password themselves.
