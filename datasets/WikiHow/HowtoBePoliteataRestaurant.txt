 Keep this in mind. Do not try to do weird or extreme things that may make other people uncomfortable. Instead, smile and try to be nice.;
, Use your pleases and thank-yous. These will be appreciated by the staff at the restaurants and may get you better service.
 Do not run around the restaurant like a little animal! This will disturb the other diners and is not polite.
 This will help save time for them, which they will appreciate. If you have questions about the menu, don't be afraid to ask them. Just be sure to do so while maintaining your manners.
 Keep your mouth closed when you chew, don't put your elbows on the table, and don't slurp! Also, try not to burp loudly, 'cause in most places this is considered very rude.
 Most service folks rely primarily on tips, so be sure to be fair. When it comes to the bill though, do not squabble loudly over it, or disagree with the waiter in an overly vocal manner. If there is an issue, just ask to talk to the manager.
