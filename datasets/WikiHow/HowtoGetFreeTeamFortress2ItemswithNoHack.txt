 Launch your TF2 game on whatever platform you’re using, and on the game’s main screen, click on “Servers” to summon a list of the servers available for you to play in.;
, The lower the latency, the better your game-play experience is going to be.

 Click on a class to select one, and click “Play” to spawn into the game world’s map. You can select any of the following:



Pyro — a final-offensive class that can set other players on fire with his flamethrower

Engineer — a last-defensive class, capable of building a number of structures to support the team

Spy — a last-support class, can equip covert tools as well as disguise himself as other players

Heavy — the strongest class, can sustain and deal immense amounts of damage, but is also the slowest class

Sniper — can shoot enemies from afar

Scout — a fast, agile first-offensive character

Soldier — a more durable class, but slower in speed

Demoman — a first-defensive class, can use high-damage weapons to provide indirect fire and can set traps

Medic — a first-support class, responsible for keeping teammates alive

 To accept, just click on “OK, resume game.”


You will not receive additional items if you do not accept it, so make sure you accept the items to continuously receive them within the 10 hours allocated to you.
