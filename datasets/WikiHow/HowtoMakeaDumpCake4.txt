, You can do this using butter or cooking spray. Set the pan aside when you are done., Set a medium-sized saucepan on the stove and pour in the milk. Tear open a packet of chocolate pudding mix, and add it into the milk. Whisk the two ingredients together to combine them, then turn the heat up to medium. Cook the pudding until it thickens, stirring often., Stir everything together using a whisk; the batter will be very thick. Note that you are using just the dry cake mix, and not the additional ingredients listed on the box., Use a rubber spatula to help scrape everything out of the saucepan and spread it evenly across the bottom of the pan, Do not stir them into the batter. They will help give the top of your cake an interesting design and texture., You do not need to take it out of the baking pan. Instead, plan on serving it straight from the pan instead., Thanks to the pudding base, the cake will be very rich and moist. If you'd like it to be even more moist, however, you could add a dollop of whipped cream, or even a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead.
