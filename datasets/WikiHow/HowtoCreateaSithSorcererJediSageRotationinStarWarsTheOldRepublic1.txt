 There are three. Two of them are damage oriented, and one is a healing discipline.

Lightning/Telekinetics - Damage.
Corruption/Seer - Healing.
Madness/Balance - Damage.
There's no "better" discipline. It's all preference. Click "Inspect" near the discipline to learn more about it.;
, As a Sorcerer/Sage, you will never engage in melee combat, and over time, the skills get weak anyway. Replace them with new force abilities., Regardless of discipline, you will get one healing skill right away: Dark Heal/Benevolence. You may want to keep it handy, because you may need to heal yourself in an emergency, or heal your companion., The wise choice is a tank, given the fragile defenses of the Sorcerer and Sage, but if you can take a few hits and are in a damage discipline, you could always go for another damage based companion or a healer., At first, it will seem pointless, but in the later levels, its a valuable asset., You will obtain utility points as you level. You can use these on Skillful, Masterful, and Heroic levels. You only get a limited amount, so choose wisely!

Regardless of discipline, they are always the same.
 Unless you have a particular distaste towards them, they should almost always be used to start fighting. Due to Crushing Darkness'/Telekinetic Gust's cooldown, its best you only use it on tougher enemies.
