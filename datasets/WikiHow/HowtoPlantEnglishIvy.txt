English ivy prefers partial sun or filtered shade, but it will grow in full shade. If you plant ivy in an area that is not shaded during the heat of the day, provide the plant with a shade screen for the first 4 to 6 months.
Ivy is an invasive plant, so pick an area where it has plenty of room to grow and will not interfere with other plants.
Be absolutely certain you want to plant it, as it's invasive, considered a weed in many areas and not allowed in some. See Warnings below.;
, English ivy grows best in a pH of around 7.
 Add hydrated lime to raise the alkalinity, or sulfur to raise the acidity. Follow package directions when adjusting your soil pH, and then test the soil again to check the new pH level.
 English ivy grow best in well-drained, fertile soil.
 The hole should be slightly wider than the plant's root base.
 This stimulates the growth of the plant and its roots.
 Fill in the hole with soil.
, Mulch helps plants retain moisture and prevents weeds from growing.
