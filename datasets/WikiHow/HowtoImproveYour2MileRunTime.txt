 Doing this will establish running as a habit in your life. This simple step will improve your heart rate, lower your weight, increase your endurance, and relieve all of the stress built up inside of you. Running every other day also gives your muscles time to heal.;
, Also it's a good idea to change your shoes every 6 months. Write the date of purchase on the sole of your shoes.
 Do not stretch right before a run. Running will naturally stretch your muscles.
 The last thing you want to do is fall out during the middle of a run.
 This is vitally important.
 On some of your run days go for 5 miles (8.0Â km).
 Try sprinting for 400 meters at a time. Do a set of four and record your times for each lap.
 Do this to show yourself how much progress you have made towards your goal.
 This is critical. Tell yourself what time you want and train for that time.
 You will have good days and bad days. Improving your time does not happen overnight. Just run and the time will follow.
 Push each other.
 You will become what you think. See yourself on that APFT test reaching your run time goal. Mental preparation is key to success...
