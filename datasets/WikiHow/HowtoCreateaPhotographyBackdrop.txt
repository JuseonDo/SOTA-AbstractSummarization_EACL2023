 Muslin fabric is a low-priced cotton found at most fabric shops.


Muslin comes in a selection of widths. Purchase 4 yards (3.66 m) to 5 yards (4.57 m) of the widest material possible.
Muslin material comes in shades of white, and can be dyed any color.;
, The material may shrink when you first wash it, but should not get any smaller with subsequent washings.
 Adding different colors will give you a selection of backdrops to work with.


Work outside when dying muslin material, in case of spills.
Follow the directions on the dye, adding the correct amount of dye to a large bucket of hot water.
Put rubber gloves on to protect your hands from the dye, and place the muslin material into the bucket of hot water and dye.
Move the fabric in the bucket to make sure the dye covers the entire piece.
Keeping the fabric in the dye for a longer period of time will produce a darker color.
Bunch up the material and submerge it for only a few minutes to obtain a tie-dyed look.
Take the muslin material out of the bucket when you have obtained the hue you desire. Rinse the fabric with warm water until the water runs clear, and then set the color with cold water.
,,, When you create backdrops for photography, you want exact edges.
 When you are making photography backdrops, taping the edges will prevent them from fraying.


Fold the end of the material over the tape, maintaining a straight line.
Place the muslin material on an ironing board, and iron the edges with a hot iron.
 Insert double-edged iron-on sewing tape at the edge of the fold and iron it on.
