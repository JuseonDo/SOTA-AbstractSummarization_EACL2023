@summary
open up a paint program and put the sprite sheet on it using copy/paste.

@summary
make a decent-sized box large enough to place your background in and paste the background from the sheet to this paint program.

@summary
after everything for the setting is in place, time for the characters.

@summary
next comes the best part.

@summary
repeat the above steps for creating a comic until you have the comic done.

@summary
make a space at the bottom and put down the comic name, your name for credit, and for giving credit to the people who made the sprites.

@summary
there are many sprite comic websites and if you can't find a certain character from a site just type it in on google and you will find one.

 (If you have more than one sheet repeat this step for each one.) OR, if you saved the sheet(s) on your hard drive, just open the file. Then open up another paint program and expand the canvas until it is the size you want.
 Then paste the important things, like the ground, and background items, such as trees and buildings.
 Copy/paste your characters into the box,but remember to have "draw opaque" on or you will have those unwanted white boxes, taking note of position, pose, and spacing. If you want, you can combine two together for an extremely funny pose!

, Using the text box tool on Paint, type whatever the character will say in the situation. Make sure to keep it sensible. A character on fire WOULDN'T say "I am cold." Also make sure to have the box not in the way of anything important and have the box all one color, preferably white

,, If you don't, and the original spriter who edited/sprited from scratch the character you're using, expect fireworks.
