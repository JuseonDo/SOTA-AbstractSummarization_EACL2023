 You will need a baby wash rag, a non-metal emery board, a dry hand towel, and a bowl of warm water. If you want to actually cut the nails, you'll need a baby-safe nail trimmer, too.
 Never try to wrestle a fussy baby.
 This depends on which you plan to trim first., In many cases, gentle filing is enough, and you won't need to cut the nails.



Brand-new babies have such moist fingernails, which often do not clip well. You can use the emery board to file them down until they are hard enough to clip.
 Use baby-safe clippers. Hold the baby's finger or toe pad and gently squeeze to pull the skin away from the nail.
,, It may take two or three sessions to clip all ten nails!
