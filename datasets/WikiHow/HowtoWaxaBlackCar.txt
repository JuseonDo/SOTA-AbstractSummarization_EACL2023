 The different types of paints used on automobiles are Acrylic Lacquer, Acrylic Enamel, and Urethane based paints.;
, A thorough wash and dry is very important to allow the wax to be applied smoothly.
 Use the wax if your black paint has hairline scratches or other minor blemishes or if it needs its shine restored. Colored wax can restore the shine of fading paint only if the paint is oxidized.
 Use a damp terry cloth or cheesecloth, and squeeze or scoop out a small amount of wax onto your cloth. Apply the wax with moderate pressure, and use circular motions that overlap. Moderate pressure ensures that the wax can get fully worked into scratches and other blemishes.
 This ensures that all the excess wax is removed and the new shine is revealed.
 Apply in circular motions with moderate pressure.
