 You'll need:

1 16-ounce packet sugar cookie dough
1.5 ounce cream cheese, room temperature
4 oz milk or white melting chocolate or 1 cup milk or white chocolate chips
1 tablespoon butter, margarine or oil
Sprinkles (garnish, optional).
 Follow the instructions given on the dough packet. Allow to cool completely before making into cookie balls., Line it with either wax paper or a silicone baking mat., Break them up as you add them, to ease the processing. Then process until fine crumbs are formed., Keep processing to combine into a firm dough., Place each ball onto the prepared cookie sheet as they're made. Then either chill on the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour, or freeze for 10 to 15 minutes. This will cause the balls to firm up., You can either do this in the microwave or over the stove, depending on what you prefer., Dunk the ball into the melted chocolate and cover with chocolate. Tap off excess chocolate as it drips, on the side of the bowl or saucepan., Continue until all of the balls have been covered., Alternatively, add desiccated coconut, cocoa powder or confectioners sugar., If it's warm, set in the refrigerator., They're now ready to eat. They can be stored in an airtight container in a cool place or in the refrigerator, for a few days.
