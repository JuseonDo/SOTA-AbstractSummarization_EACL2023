 You can add guidelines if you like, but you should be all right without them.;
, Try to have it curve along the line of the circle you drew in step 1.
 The point at which the two lines overlap is where the number of the ball will be.
 It should look the same as the first circle you drew, just a different size.
 This step is only for the billiard balls with numbers 9-15, however, so skip it if you're doing any of 1-8.
 If you want you can draw a surface for the ball to be sitting on or add a shadow to make it look more real.
 For this tutorial, the 9 ball was used, so the coloring is primarily yellow with white on the top and bottom.
