 You'll need six (or eight for a fuller snowflake) pieces of paper (white copy paper will do, although you can use more elaborate types like construction or origami paper), scissors, clear tape and a stapler.;
, If the paper you are using does not make a perfect triangle, cut off the rectangular edge that sticks out and make it align perfectly. You should end up with a square folded into a triangle. Fold the triangle in half, noting where the folded "bottom" of the triangle is. If you have to cut off the bottom end of the paper, keep it and put it aside.
 Position the scissors along the bottom fold, and parallel to one of the edges going up to the top (your cuts should be somewhat diagonal). Cut almost all the way up to the double folded crease, but not quite. Keep about the same distance between each cut. (This might not be suitable for thicker paper, since the number of layers makes it difficult to cut through.) When you unfold the triangle into a larger triangle, it should look like the photo above.
 Turn it so that one of the points of the square faces you. It should look like the picture.
 Tape these two pieces together. You should see triangle shapes on each side of the roll.
 Take the next two paper lines and pull them together on the opposite side of the tube and tape together as before. This will be a more rounded shape and wider than the first tube.
,, Do the other 3 pieces the same way. Now you will have 2 pieces consisting of 3 strands or "arms" each. (For smaller snowflakes, it may be easier to use double-sided tape or white glue in place of staples.)

,, This ensures that the snowflake shape is pulled into place. See picture at top for the finished snowflake.
