 A standard adult serving is 1/3 lb of duck (.15 kg).
 This grade of duck meat will be a 6-8-week-old duckling raised indoors and fed with fortified corn and soybeans.
 A whole duck with skin on is the most popular and commonly found selection. However, you can have the meat divided, de-boned and the duck skin and fat layer removed by a butcher.
