 Wait until you’ve dried your hair completely and heat-styled it as you normally would, then spray it on as a final step.Use your fingers to tousle it and you’re all set.


You can spray it all over your hair and tousle it, or you can apply it from mid-shaft to the ends.
For extra volume, be sure to spray near the roots.
 Many people avoid washing their hair every single day, especially in winter, when the climate can make hair especially brittle. Using sea salt shimmer spray on second or third day hair can keep your hair looking grease-free, texturized and bouncy for another day or so before having to wash it. As an added bonus to the beachy waves, sea salt shimmer spray provides a subtle golden glow!The results are similar to using dry shampoo, wicking away grease while still preserving your hair’s moisture.
 Although many regular sea salt sprays on the market can be drying, most of the shimmer versions are special organic blends that offer positive benefits along with that beachy iridescent glow. Check the labels and look for products made with moisturizing essential oils and aloe vera.


Also look out for brands that include organic sea kelp in the ingredients. Sea kelp can preserve moisture and provide a dose of vitamins and minerals that nourish both the hair and scalp.
