 An epilator is a hand-held device that pulls hairs up by the root when moved across skin. The plucking heads on a body epilator will be too cumbersome to use on the upper lip, so you’ll have to shop around for a slim model designed for facial hair, touchups, and other small-scale work


Epilating is only possible if the hairs are long enough for the epilator to catch. If you aren’t willing to let your hairs grow long enough to do this, use another option listed here (such as bleaching).
 The warmer your skin, the more open your pores – and the easier the hairs will be to remove.
 This will not only make the skin above the lip easier to access, but also keep your delicate lip skin away from the epilator.
 Unless you’re very used to plucking these hairs, be warned that it will probably hurt. You will get used to this with time, but in the beginning, it will be uncomfortable.


Start with the slowest speed. Until you get the hang of epilating, just remember that easy does it.
 If your upper lip is sore, you may want to wait a while before doing this.
