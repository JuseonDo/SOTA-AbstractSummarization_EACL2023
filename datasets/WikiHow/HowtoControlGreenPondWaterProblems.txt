 Your fish can affect the pond water quality. First of all the number fish should be according to the pond size because the organic waste will be more with more fish.;
, when these small algae cells come in contact with sunlight produce algae by photosynthesis.
 These are biological bacteria which are already present in the pond work by decomposing the organic waste quickly, so they help to reduce the nutrients for the algae.
 These are food sources for algae.
, Aquatic plants in the pond have a huge impact on growing green algae cells as algae require sunlight for its survival so, when aquatic plants restrict the amount of sunlight, green algae causing cells are prohibited.
 It does not harm the pond and aquatic life in any way.
