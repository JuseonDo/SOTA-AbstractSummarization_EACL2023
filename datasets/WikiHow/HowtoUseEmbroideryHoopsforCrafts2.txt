@summary
use the embroidery hoop as your "loom".

@summary
cut the sleeves of an old t-shirt into half-inch to one-inch-wide loops.

@summary
stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, spacing them evenly.

@summary
attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself.

@summary
connect another weft or two using the same method - looping them through the previous weft and through themselves.

@summary
,

@summary
begin weaving the weft over and under, forming a tight spiral.

@summary
continue weaving and adding wefts.

@summary
when the basket is the desired size, cut you last weft loop.

@summary
cut the warps one at a time.

  This works best with a round one.  Any size will do.  Just remember: the larger the hoop, the larger the finished project.
  These will be your warps and wefts.


Warp - the material you string on the hoop.
Weft - the material you weave with.
  (These are the warps.)  Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it.  Smaller projects may use as few as 4, whereas larger projects may use more than 12.  It is ideal that the warps be the same color.
  Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material.  Don't fret if you do. It happens.
,  Keep the material snug, but not tight.  Push together two loops at the top and treat them as one warp.  This creates an odd number of warps.  As you go around, be sure to go under the warp that you went over last time.  Continue this method until your spiral is about the size of the bottom of your basket.
  Begin pulling the material tighter, making it pull on the weaving. By doing this, you make the sides pull up, little by little, into a basket shape. As you work, the sides should start to bend up.
  Wrap it around a nearby warp and tie it firmly.  Tuck the ends in.
  Tie the ends in pairs.  Trim to make a fringe or tuck in.
