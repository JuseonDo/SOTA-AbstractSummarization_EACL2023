dissolve calcium into water prior to mixing with concrete.

@summary
a calcium addition of 2% by volume is a standard calcium amount to increase concrete setting times.

@summary
mix concrete together as per normal using calcium enriched water.

@summary
place and finish concrete quickly after mixing since the set time will be accelerated.
@article
 Agitate the water to help the calcium flakes to dissolve.;
, A five gallon bucket full of concrete would require only a small handful of calcium to accelerate the setting dramatically. A medium Tim Hortons coffee cup of calcium would increase the set time of almost 400 pounds of mixed concrete.
, Direct sunlight or warm ambient temperatures will cause the set time to increase even further. Calcium is most useful for cold weather concrete applications where a high initial set strength is required to resist the potential damage to fresh concrete from freezing.
