 Remove all manuals, warranty information, receipts, cardboard, and anything else in there. This is temporary and you'll be able to put them back in later on.
 Mark the connecting end of the wire above the "Samsung Galaxy S III" text and the USB end at the bottom of the box, which will be hidden from view at most times., Be very careful, as you wouldn't want to lose a finger over a DIY phone dock! To make cutting easier, put the box lid on top of the box itself., Simply cut or tear these off and throw them away., Thread the wires into the holes to round them out., Push the connecting end through one hole so that it balances in it without falling out. With the USB end, pull the wire straight through and put the lid on the box. If the box does not close fully, continue pulling the USB end until it does., You'll find that the phone cannot sit on the dock without falling down, because the connecting end keeps slipping through the hole. Take off the lid, and use the Blu-Tack or superglue to hold the connecting end in place., Cut and pull off the cardboard residue. Use a permanent marker to blend the holes in with the entire box. If you have an artistic flair, try painting the box or using another form of creativity to make the dock look its best., Replace what you've taken out of the box. Discard the cardboard, but otherwise all the other manuals, warranty information and receipts can go straight back in., Find a place that looks good and is safe.,,
