, It's much easier to bake when everything is already in front of you.
 Mix the ingredients together in a large bowl, using a wooden spoon.


Mix with the wooden spoon until the mix becomes thick, sticky, and hard to mix.
 Try to make the cookies all the same size.
 The length of cooking time will depend on how big or small you have made them.


Set the timer right after you place the cookies in the oven.
 Place the cookies on a cooling rack by using a spatula, and let them cool for about 10 minutes before eating.
 Cookies that are not eaten now should be stored in an airtight container.
