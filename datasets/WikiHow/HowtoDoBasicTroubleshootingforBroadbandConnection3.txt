 Look at the back of the router and ensure all cables are properly secured. Trace them back until you reach the wall socket. Check for any broken or faulty cables.
 A simple restart may just do the trick. Wait for about a minute.
 As you do so, observe all the lights on the router.
 Find out if doing the previous steps has resulted in a restored connection.
 If after the restart you still don’t have Internet connection, the problem may be outside your own home or with the service provider. It can also be the router itself.
