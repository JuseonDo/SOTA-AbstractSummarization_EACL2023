Whether you are the party who posted the advertisement or are responding to an advertisement, meet people at busy public venues such as restaurants or shopping centers to perform transactions.
If you are participating in a job interview, arrange to have the interview take place during business hours.
If meeting in public is not an option, bring a trusted friend or family member with you and tell people where you are going to be.
