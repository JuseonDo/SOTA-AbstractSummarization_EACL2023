 It does not need to be too detailed, but do include major lines and points. Do not shade the picture.;
, With each of the colors of pencils that you will be using, shade a small square and paint over it with water. This will allow you to see how your colors will look, as some colors look completely different once water has been added.
 Blending colors in this method can produce beautiful effects and add dimension to your picture.
 Do not worry about shading yet.
 This time, leave blank the areas of highlight and shade in your shadowed areas.
 Using more than one color to shade your picture will give it dimension.
,, Make sure that your brush strokes go with the contours of your subject. Start out with a little bit of water, and add more to produce a more washed out effect. The more water is added, the lighter the color will become and the less you will see your pencil lines. However, if too much water is used, the colors will run. Use a smaller brush for detailed ares.
 Doing this provides a very strong color, and it is difficult to hide mistakes.
 You may or may not want to add water to this layer.
