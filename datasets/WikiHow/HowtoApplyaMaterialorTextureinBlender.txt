,, You can adjust the color and reflection (diffuse and specular) settings here. The intensity slider will adjust how prominent the reflection is, and the "hardness" slider will affect the sharpness.


For this example, an orange material with a soft reflection will be used.
 It should have the selected material applied to it.
 You can find it right next to the "Materials" tab, then click the "New" button.
 This will allow you to select a texture. The "Clouds" option will be selected for this example.



For this example, a size of 0.1 and a depth of 6 will be used.
, If you don't want the texture to be a very saturated pink color (when will you need to use that?) go down to the "Influence" panel in the Textures tab and click on the color swatch.


Change the color to something more reasonable (for this example it will be a dark brown).
The updated texture will show in the Preview panel.
 The texture has appeared; however it's a little stretched out.
 Since the texture is stretched vertically here, the Z value will be changed to 3. This will squish the texture so it appears normally.
