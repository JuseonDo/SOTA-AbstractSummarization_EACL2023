play in all possible auctions: the first rule is to participate in all auctions one at a time weather or not you need the product.

@summary
place bids early: when you place bids early, your chances of getting a position highly increase and you spend less in the process.

@summary
create gaps: as the auction progresses, more bidders join the fun, and many think the winning bid will be far away from the maximum price.

@summary
bid for fixed value: conventionally it’s seen that participants, who bid at bidstall, end up winning when their bidding amount is about 30-40% of the product.

@summary
heavy bidding: while this strategy is recommended for bidders with high risk appetite, it’s not a bad strategy either.

@summary
finally remember, there is no free lunch anywhere, there never will be.

 With a proper strategy, this mindset of other bidders can be used to your advantage. The recommended technique during an auction bid process is to get a position first by placing a bid & follow it up with a series of 20-30 bids downwards. In the process leave one or 2 gap bids. In the event your lower positions are cracked you always place the gap numbers as the competition is likely high on the lower side of the bidding bracket.
 So be ready to invest that percentage of amount. No guarantee you will win, but statistically about 95% of bidders have been winners when their investment is between 30-40%. The more you bid the better your chances of winning.
 When you place more bids, you essentially knock out competition from freebies & small bidders, but still have a chance of getting the product. Keep a tab on your bid packs to ensure you do not overbid the value of the product in the one of the best strategy based auction sites.
