 First, boot up Ubuntu Linux,make sure you have an implementation of the Java JDK installed on your system, whether it is OpenJDK or Oracle Java JDK, which lays the foundation for the Android SDK. If you don't have the Java JDK installed on your system please install it, you can obtain the Oracle Java JDK from Download the Oracle Java JDK,for more information on:
