The airship.
The Rat's tail. (don't have the Rat's tail, tomorrow, check back in about 8:00 or so to view Get the Rat's Tail in Final Fantasy I, kay?);

 Now head in those stairs and go on into this room , and keep on walking, (boring) soon you will encounter a big Dragon. Talk to him, he will say something bout your Rat's Tail and upgrade your people. Read the tips for descriptions of your new jobs.
