 The smell will drive them away. Lemon juice will also work for this.
 Put a bit of ferret poop in the boxes and place your ferret in the box the first time so that he knows where it is. Ferrets will usually potty in the same corner, so it helps if you know what corner of the room or cage they like, and put the litter box in that corner.
, Ferrets do not like to poo where they sleep.
 It is not only physically harmful, but mentally as well. It is important to note that ferrets can only be about 90% potty trained. They will have accidents, especially if their boxes are not cleaned on a regular basis. Also, do not use cat litter for training; carefresh bedding works the best since ferrets do not usually eat this and are not allergic to it. Make sure to NEVER use sand/powder/clumping, clay, or wood based litter. They will cause respiratory problems and can shorten your ferrets lifespan. They can also make a mess as ferrets like to dig in them. But allowing the to dig in there should be avoided also. A great ferret litter is Yesterday's News cat litter, but make sure to buy the unscented. NEVER buy scented litter as this is not good for your ferrets lungs.
