 When the paints run together to form the marbling effect, they'll mix and form new colors. Keep the new color combinations in mind in order to avoid dull colors.


Related colors work best. For example, keep reds and oranges together and keep blues and greens together.;
,, Cover the work surface with several layers of newspaper to prevent paint spills from going everywhere. The work surface area that is protected should be at least four times as high as the bottle.
, This doesn't need to be an expert painting job but use lots of paint.
 Flick the paint across the bottle; just do it randomly without trying to effect a pattern. In order to paint around the whole bottle, insert one finger into the neck of the bottle and carefully move it around.
 Use a new brush each time.
 Just leave the bottle standing and the colors will run down it. This creates the marbling effect. Make any touch-ups that might be needed.
, If needed, lean on the side to dry the base. The bottle is now ready for using as a vase or decorative object.
