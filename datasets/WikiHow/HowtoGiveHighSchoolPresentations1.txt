 It is very essential to know your topic very well. Learn things about your subject. Remember, it is a presentation, meaning presenting information to an audience, not reading your report.;
, After introducing yourself in front, start your introduction to your presentation with a short concise idea about your topic. Show your objectives or a bird's eye view of your report. Then, make it strong with a spark of interest and camaraderie with the audience and teacher.
, Make sure that people can read it from a distance. Avoid creative and fancy fonts.
 Avoid complicated charts. Keep visual ideas simple.
 You don't want to stumble on your work and get confused with it.
 Practice at least three days before the day of presentation. If you are going to present a complicated topic, preparing a week before the day is ideal.
