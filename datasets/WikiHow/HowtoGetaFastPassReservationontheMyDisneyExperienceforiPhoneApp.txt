 After you have used your first three you can book another one and then another after you have used your 4th one and so on. Each new FastPass will be awarded the minute after the hour block has finished (not until your window was supposed to expire).;

,, If you have already an account, enter your email address and your Password then tap "Sign In".
,,, Choose either "Yes, I have a package with tickets" or "No, my tickets were purchased separately."

,, Use the scrollbar to select the date you'd like the reservations for. If you are in the park for that specific day, you might want to leave the scrollbar alone, verify the park and move to the next step on their app by hitting the "Next" button in the top right corner. You can scan in the paper card/ticket to link the tickets to your account or type in the provided information., You'll only be able to receive certain amounts of rides in each tier.
 Watch over on the right hand side the times the FastPass+ reservation is blocked-out for. This time gives you a one-hour window of time in which to come back to ride the ride. This window of time has never changed, and potentially won't change in the future, though you never know what Disney is planning behind the scenes.
, This object can be bought at a Walt Disney World store. MagicBands are the only way to access your FastPass+ reservations nowadays within the parks themselves, and are definitely a useful tool when it comes to Walt Disney World vacations.
