 For this method, you don't have to buy any extra ingredients other than basic household supplies, like aluminum foil, a pencil, screwdriver, and scissors.;
, You can poke a hole with a screwdriver or a knife.
,


Wrap the whole thing in aluminum foil. The pencil is used to create a mold for the foil.
 The shape of the pencil will remain in place leaving a chimney for the smoke to travel through up the aluminum foil.
, The smoke will start to pour out of the hole in the ball and out the chimney left by the pencil.
 Run away and do not breath in the toxic smoke.
