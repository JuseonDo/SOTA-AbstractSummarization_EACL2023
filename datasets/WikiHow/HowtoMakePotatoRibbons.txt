 Wash especially well if you intend to keep the peel intact.;
, Cut round and round, keeping the peel as thin as possible as you go. Make as many long ribbons as you can.
 A tea towel is ideal.
 Rice bran oil is a good choice as it has a high heating point and is mono-unsaturated.
 These go well with fish or grilled meats, and a lovely fresh salad.
