@summary
measure the proportional fractional volume change (also known as dilation) of the material.
@article
 Apply a known force to the material in both the stress and strain directions. Measure the dilation (dSs) that occurs in the material when stress only is applied. Measure the dilation (dSn) that occurs in the material when the external force applies only strain.
