beware of zero-liquidity.

Every home that is sold, new or used, adds to the economy because the owners will buy paint, carpet, appliances, and so on.
Every home sold contributes to the sense of social balance and consumer satisfaction.



Zero-liquidity occurs as interests rates are lowered toward zero to spur borrowing and more money floods the market.
As liquidity freezes, mortgage holders find they have over-bought and are upside down in their mortgages.
The longer the housing impasse lasts, the longer the recession is likely to last.
