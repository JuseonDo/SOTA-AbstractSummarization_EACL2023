The "X-MULT" switch should be set to the band being used.

 This will help you determine if the the audio oscillator and modulation circuits work properly., This will help you determine if the RF section works properly., If not, the intermittent contact on the wheel may require cleaning or lubrication, or the spring fingers may require adjustment to ensure they are making good contact.,,, There are 9 tubes in the 25D model., Some spots may require re-soldering., These units are located on the underside of the unit., They may look like Mica. Replace any that are.
