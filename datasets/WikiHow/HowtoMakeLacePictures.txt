 These are listed below. If the lace needs pressing, do so now, on the wrong side.;
,, This should be about 2cm (3/4") larger than the cardboard piece.
 Try a few positions until you get one that you like the most.
, Fold the excess over the back of the cardboard and tape it into place firmly. (You could also glue it in place if preferred but tape makes it easier to remove later.) Pull it tightly before taping into place.
 Place another piece of cardboard at the back to serve as the backing against the wall.
 It is now ready for hanging or displaying wherever you'd like.
