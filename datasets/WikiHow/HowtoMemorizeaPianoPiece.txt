 How difficult is it for your level? Realise that you cannot master Liszt's Liebestr√§um if you've only played for a year, as it requires very advanced techniques and precision.;
, If you feel it's very difficult, then try one or two bars at a time. Likewise, if you feel that it's quite simple, challenge your memory and learn up to five at a time.
 Play it slowly, don't rush! Your finger muscles need to remember in what way they moved when playing each note and phrase, and it takes time. Once you can play this without any mistakes, at a reasonable pace, repeat until you have played it perfectly 3 times in a row. Also make sure to look at the sheet music closely, your mind needs to develop it as a photographic memory.
 Once you have played it perfectly, repeat until you have played it perfectly 3 times in a row.

, Think of two phrases (four bars each) as being named measures ABCD and EFGH. What you need to do is to play measures D and E together to make sure that the pieces moves along without any interruptions. It is important that you do this step, otherwise it's not going to sound very good.
