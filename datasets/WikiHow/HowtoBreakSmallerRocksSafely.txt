 Some suggestions are:


A denim bag (You could make one from an old pair of jeans)
A box (Could be somewhat awkward)
A corner;
, Be sure not to overcrowd the bag. If using the other methods, the same applies.


Be sure that if you put multiple rocks into the bag that you want the rocks to be all the same hardness. In other words, don't mix up the type of rocks.
, Is your rock chalk, granite, obsidian? If it's too soft and you hit it very hard, you will turn it into dust. If it is very hard, and you barely hit it, you will, if you're lucky, chip it and that's it.
 Break them until they are the size (or sizes) that you want, depending upon your end objective.
 This isn't required, but you should do it in case any spare shard gets loose.
 Or go to the location that that particular surface is at.
 That way, they won't be too small.
 Rock tumbling is one way of learning about the beauty that can be found in rocks.
