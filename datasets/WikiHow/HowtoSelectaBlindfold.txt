,, Be able to blindfold someone quickly, without getting hair caught in the blindfold.


Be sure that you are applying the blindfold so that contestant cannot peek through the area between the bottom of the blindfold and their cheeks. Seeing a small amount of light may be unavoidable and OK. More may not be.
 Be sure the blindfolds are easy for you to find. Be sure to select the right blindfold for each contestant.


Wash or sanitize hands before touching each blindfold and/or contestant.
