There should pop up a screen saying Areas, Airports, Interiors etc. Click on 'Airports'.
Then a list of airports in San Andreas comes up. These are 'Las Venturas', 'San Fierro', 'Los Santos', 'Abandoned Airfield' and 'Army Airport' Select the army one. NOTE: To select the base, you have to press space on your keyboard, NOT enter or return.
 Look around until you find a ramp going down and at the end of the ramp there should be a room. Walk into it
