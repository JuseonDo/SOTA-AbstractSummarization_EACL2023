You can probably take testosterone if you’re recovering from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer treatments often disrupt hormone levels, and testosterone treatments can correct testosterone deficiencies by rebuilding bone mass, increasing energy levels, and solving related problems;however, if you’re at high risk for recurrence, your doctor might recommend against it.
Low testosterone has also been linked with type 2 diabetes and imbalances in blood sugar levels.If you’re looking for a way to control or prevent diabetes, you might choose to take testosterone.
 You may also have difficulty concentrating, too.


Taking testosterone can cause significant emotional changes, and these changes can affect how other people perceive and act toward you.
