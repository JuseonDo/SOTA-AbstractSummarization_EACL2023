 Hard water can leave deposits behind, but using products to dissolve them can damage bathroom vanities. Read the directions carefully, or simply use white vinegar to soften the spots and deposits. Do not use acids like vinegar if your vanity top is made from stone, marble or concrete, since these can etch the surface.

Hard water deposits can solidify, making them almost impossible to remove once enough sediment has collected.
