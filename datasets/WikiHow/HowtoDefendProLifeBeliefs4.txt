@summary
compare something you know for sure is a living thing to something you know is definitely not.

@summary
consider that everyone who ever walked the earth was able to live because their parents didn't have an abortion.

@summary
ask them to imagine for a minute that they are a fetus: pretend you understand human speech and can hear your mother talking.

@summary
if they try to argue that even if abortion was illegal, we could not prevent women from having abortions, remind them the exact same argument could be used to stop anything from becoming illegal.

@summary
if they argue that a woman should be able to control her own body, explain that the fertilized egg is not her body, rather, it is, conceivably a separate human being.

@summary
if they argue that abortions are mostly done for health reasons or in case of rape, remind them that only 7 percent of women report that their abortion was due to a health reason or a possible health problem with the baby, and less than half a percent report that their abortion was because they became pregnant as a result of rape, which means the vast majority, 93 percent, of abortions in america are purely elective -- done on healthy women to end the lives of healthy children.

 Take a snowball. If you roll it down a hill, it grows and develops. However, it isn't made of cells, can't reproduce, and can't respond to its environment. How about a leopard? It is made of cells, it grows and develops from a cub to an adult, it can make babies, and it responds to its environment. If they bring up a woman who is infertile, say that women as a species can reproduce, it's just that a deformity causes some women to be infertile.
 There are even some that have survived an abortion and are still living today. If you have an abortion, you may forever wonder who your baby might have grown up to be; you may have just deprived the world of a great artist, political leader, scientist, important military leader, violent criminal, etc. Everyone deserves a chance to make the world a better place.
 She wants to get an abortion. You want to say, "Mommy, don't kill me," but she can't hear you. It may seem silly, but, you were a fetus a long time ago. And, whether or not you believe a fetus is a human being, you would not be here right now if your mother had an abortion. Or, maybe you would.
 To turn it around, if murder was legalized, more people would be like "Oh then it must be okay to do it!" Same for abortions, if it became illegal, people would think, "It must be illegal for a reason." Plenty of people get abortions without thinking it through thoroughly. Sadly, many just see it as a shortcut - they've never been told that it might possibly be wrong.
 After all, if it was part of her body, that would mean the mother has 2 hearts, 4 legs, 4 arms, and 2 heads for almost 9 months of her life!
