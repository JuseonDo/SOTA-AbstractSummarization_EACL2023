@summary
fill your pot or your basket 3/4 full of florist’s foam.

@summary
tuck a metal florist’s stick into the rubber band or wire that surrounds each clothing flower.

@summary
press the foliage into the florist’s foam.

@summary
add the baby clothing.

@summary
tie an attractive ribbon around the top of the container.
@article
 If necessary, trim the foam with a knife or scissors so that it matches the contours of the container.
 The top of the clothing flower should be facing upward.
 Place shorter pieces around the edge and taller pieces toward the center.
 Push the florist’s sticks that are attached to the baby clothing into the foam. Fill in any gaps where you have no foliage so that the foam is not visible when you present the gift.
 Choose a wired decorative ribbon for the most elegant appearance.
