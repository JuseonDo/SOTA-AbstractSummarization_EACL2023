 Some find it fun to create themselves, others like to create their own unique person. Whatever works for you is fine. You can edit the player's appearance (i.e. skin color, hair color and style, etc.) in this screen. You can also edit their name and hometown while creating your player.;
, Training camp allows you to receive bonus attribute points that will later go into building up your players attributes. There are five (5) events, and you can earn up to 80 bonus points.
 The more attribute points you earned in training camp, the higher your players overall rating will go. The higher your overall rating, the higher caliber you are (i.e. 5 star, 4 star, etc.) Players with a higher caliber have the option of choosing any school they want.
 Based on your caliber, you will be given a list of schools. Be careful though, you can only pick what school you go to once.
 In order to become a campus legend, you have to be both a good student and athlete. If you are successful in that, you will become a campus legend.
