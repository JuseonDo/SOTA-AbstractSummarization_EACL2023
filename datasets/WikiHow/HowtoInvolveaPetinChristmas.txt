 Take a photo of your pet then find a small frame with a hook so that you can hang it on the tree. During the holiday season craft stores will probably have small decorations that you could even glue to the frame- like foam stickers.;
, Just have a member in your family hold the animal or get the animal to stand next to someone in the picture. This will show that they are a part of your family.
 For example, you could have your dog wear a Christmas collar or put a red ribbon around your fish tank. This just adds decoration to them and the room.
 While everyone is opening presents, give your pet a gift, such as a bone for a dog or a toy for a cat. It is also fun to wrap your gift for a dog, sometimes they will even unwrap it themselves.
 If you live where it snows, then just take your dog outside to play with it. Or just spend a little time with your pet inside on Christmas giving it special attention, even if it's just a belly rub.
