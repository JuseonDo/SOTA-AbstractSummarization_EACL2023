 First, boil your needle for five to ten minutes on a stove. Keep your needle and your jewelry in rubbing alcohol. If you have newly bought them, this might not be necessary, as they would already be sterile, but it is highly recommended that you sterilize them too, just to be on the safe side.;
, Evenly mark two points using a pen or a marker, wherever you want your piercing to be.
 The numbing gel is a better option, as ice only numbs the first layer of skin, and in addition to that, it tightens the pores of the skin, making it harder for the hollow needle to go through.
 Pull the skin out, away from the eye.
 Push the needle out from the other point.
, Clean it daily with rubbing alcohol or a saline solution.
