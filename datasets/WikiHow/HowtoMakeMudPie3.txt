 The pie crust will never become truly hard; it will always be a little crumbly.
 Use a rubber spatula to help spread it around. Make sure that the mixture covers the entire bottom of the crust.
 This will give your pie an extra crunch. If you don't like nuts, you can omit this step., Again, use a rubber spatula to help spread the pudding evenly across the pie. Be careful not to disturb any of the previous layers.
 To make the peaks, gently tap the whipped cream with a rubber spatula. Don't worry about garnishing the pie just yet. It needs to set first.
 This will take at least 2 to 4 hours. Leaving the pie in the fridge overnight would be better, however.When covering the pie, take care not to smoosh the whipped cream topping too much.
 If you have some chopped pecans leftover, you can sprinkle those on top. If you aren't a fan of pecans, try sliced almonds instead. You can also drizzle some hot fudge, chocolate sauce, or caramel sauce on top.For an added touch, scatter some chocolate curls on top.
