 The best rum to se would be "Rum 151," but you can use any other type of rum as well., If you can't find any Tabasco sauce, you can use any other type of hot sauce. Keep the bottle as close as possible to the surface of the drink so that the sauce floats on top. Do not stir it., Be prepared for a strong taste. Many people claim that the Suicide Shot does not taste great, which is understandable considering the name.
