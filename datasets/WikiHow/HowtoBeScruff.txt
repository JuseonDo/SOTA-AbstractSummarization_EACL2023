 The first thing to understand about being scruff is that you shouldn't care about anything- people's opinions should be just that and not influence you in the least bit. Just go with the flow and don't let anyone's remark phase you.;
, Remember that you want to look like you've just woken up, so don't wear anything dramatic:

, Wear Vans or dirty skate shoes, and bandanas are big in scruff.
 Peace signs are also acceptable.
 You can tie a bandana around it, or even wear a beanie. Girls look great with a mullet-style haircut, look at Joan Jett for inspiration. Black hair is also a big plus, but don't feel the need to dye it just to look scruff. Leave it be and lay off the styling products.
 A bit of eyeliner is good, but don't use blushers or lip gloss. Also, don't tan, as white skin suggests that you don't care much about the current "self tanning" craze.
 They can be anything from goth, emo punk to grunge, metal etc. If you're not really wired on the whole rock scene, Nirvana, HIM and Avenged Sevenfold are a good place to start. Other scruff bands are The Runaways, The Smiths, The Cure, Kill Hannah and Pearl Jam, but what you listen to is really up to you.
 This can be a phrase, a band, a certain colour, a doodle or even a facial expression.
, Stand up for what you believe in, join movements which interest you and generally have your own personality. Never try to be like someone else, but rather try to improve on their qualities in yourself.
