 Rinse your face several times. What this does is open up all of your pores. You can't rinse a face with closed pores!, Apply as directed and don't forget to scrub!, If you don't rinse off, the soap can actually CAUSE face problems. Unless directed, rinse directly off., This will clean all of your pores out...and it should also leave you with a shining glow!, This will protect your face from all dirt and yuck that cause acne, blackheads, and pimples., Your face should be almost rubbery when done. All clean! If you have face cream, its good to apply so your face stays moist.
