 When you move to a new place you need a lot of boxes to pack! If you don't think you're going to move, give them to someone who is.;
, Not only are you making the earth happy, you're making people happy too!

, Simply paint them and write your child's name. Once it is dry, you may place any toys or items inside.
 It never hurts to be a little safe.
 That way, kid and pets won't be messing with hazardous spray bottles.
 You can put your piggy banks, books, and other stuff on it.,, You can wrap them with colorful tissue paper and then tape them. You can also paint them and let them dry afterwards.
 Make sure it's comfortable, that they can sleep right in it, and the bed fits them when they lay down.
 You can decorate the boxes to make them look awesome and gorgeous.
 Instead, store your jewelry there so it doesn't get scratched or lost. You'll be thankful when you do so.
