@summary

 Take care not to grate your fingers.;
, The core should run the length of each cut face.
, By doing so you slice through the middle of each of the many, many tiny capsules that hold its juice, each of which runs from the core toward the outside of the fruit.
 Because the cuts are away from the center of the fruit the seeds are unlikely to be ejected but pick them out if they are. Depending on how the cuts were made, the central part of the fruit may be ejected but it should all be together and easily picked out. If the cut edges are squeezed together, up and inwards the central part may be less likely to be ejected.
 The husk can be fed to a garbage disposer to deodorize it while making it go away, composted, thrown away, or given to an animal capable of digesting it such as a cow.
