Save before you do this, for you only have one chance to catch him. Zapdos is level 50, and very hard to catch. If you accidentally made it faint or you ran out of Pokeballs, restart the game.
Try both a ground-type Pok√©mon to weaken him, and a flying-type one to lower his health.
Try not to use your Master Ball for this. It is possible to catch Zapdos with an Ultra Ball, so load up on those before you battle.
