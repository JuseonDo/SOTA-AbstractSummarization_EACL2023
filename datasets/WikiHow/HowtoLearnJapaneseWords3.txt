@summary
it happens that in japanese words you might see a part which looks like a word in your mother tongue.

 If this is the case, you can take that as a recognition support. Example:A singer is in Japanese 歌手 what is pronunced as "kashu". Can you see the English word "cash" in it? You only need an explanation now. A singer often makes a lot of "cash", therefor he is a "kashu".
