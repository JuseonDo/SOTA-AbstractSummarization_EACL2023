 There are many different sizes, as well as styles, colors, designs, and patterns to choose; from traditional silk to customized leather with sport team logos! You can buy yarmulkes online or at a Judaical store.
 However, you do not have to wear it when sleeping, bathing, swimming, etc. If desired, you can purchase clips or bobby pins to fasten the yarmulke in place so it does not fall off in the wind, or while doing strenuous activities.,, It's that simple! Some Jews who are of Orthodox, and some Conservative affiliations choose to wear a Yarmulke at all times, during all regular day activities., No one will be offended.
