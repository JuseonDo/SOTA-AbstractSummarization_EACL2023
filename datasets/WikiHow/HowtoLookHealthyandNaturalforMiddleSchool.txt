 You don't want to be nicknamed "Groggy Eyes" for having circles under your eyes and yawning.;
,, When you dry it off, dab with a soft towel, don't rub, unless you want to look red and itch all day.
,, Eat a bowl of Cheerios, a banana and some toast with your favorite topping.
 Trust me, it does wonders.
, Each person needs some jeans, girls look great in skinny jeans while boys look good in straight jeans. Wear solid color socks but occasionally wear a patterned sock or a neon sock for style. For boys whatever matches your style for shoes: Converses, skater shoes, Nikes, New Balances, dressy shoes, whatever it is. Be sure to keep your own style as well. Girls should have nice sneakers, a pair of Converses or skater shoes, flip flops, any style of boot, or any other pair of shoes the girl needs/affords. For shirts, don't be a fashion label for one brand of clothes. Wear shirts that scream you.
 Don't have it brushed the same way. Try a new style. Don't look...boring. Make sure there are no frizzies.
 Wear jewelry, add a hair clip, add perfume, put on some deodorant.
