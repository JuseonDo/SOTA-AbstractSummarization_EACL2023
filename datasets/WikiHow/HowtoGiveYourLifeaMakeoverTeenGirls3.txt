 Most people will tell themselves that they are, when they know that some changes could be made to make them healthier.
 It's a chart that says what you eat every day and at what time. This will organize your eating habits. Make sure that you follow what you written down and in between meals to snack on something healthy like an apple.
 Find a sport you like such as swimming or softball, or go to the gym. You can even go to a nature sanctuary and hike, it's all considered exercise and will also lower stress level.
