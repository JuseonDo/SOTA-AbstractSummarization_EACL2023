 iPads have two physical buttons: the sleep/wake button on the top and the home button on the tablet's face. The sleep/wake button is the one on the top of your iPad, up and to the right of the camera lens.;

If the logo doesn't appear after five seconds, your battery is probably drained. Charge your iPad using a wall charger for fifteen minutes to a half hour.
 Press the round On button, and drag the button to the right.


If this is your first time turning on your iPad, you will need to follow the steps to set up your iPad.
