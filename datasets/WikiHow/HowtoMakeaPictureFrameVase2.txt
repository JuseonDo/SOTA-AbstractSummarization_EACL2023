 If you are planning to mount the vase to the back of a picture frame, prep the backing by painting it. Allow paint to dry before adhering it to the frame backing.
 Make sure both the vase and the backing are clean and free of debris.


Lay the frame with vase down on a flat surface so it can dry. You don’t want to stand it up or hang it until it is completely dry.
 Find a level area and tap the hanger kit into place.
 Arrange the flowers before hanging on the wall.
