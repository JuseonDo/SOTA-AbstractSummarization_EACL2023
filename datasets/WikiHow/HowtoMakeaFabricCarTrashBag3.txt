 The binding should be sewn not only onto the bag but also the lining.
 Hand stitch the binding into place.



Sew the fabric handle and then pin one end inside the bag, just below the binding fabric.






Wrap the other end around so that it joins the original end inside the bag and pin it in order to secure it to the binding.






Sew the fabric handle in place. Add any jewels or adornments you’d like to include to personalize the bag.



Roll Pellon into a circle and sew the edges so it creates a cylinder shape. Consider using a sewing machine for a quick stitch or you can hand sew.






Slide Pellon into the bag and sew it into the lower area of the bag. A few stitches will help secure the Pellon in place. Allow some room between the binding and the Pellon so that a plastic bag can be dropped into the bag and fit securely around the Pellon inside the bag.
