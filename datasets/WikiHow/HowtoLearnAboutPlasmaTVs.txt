@summary
realize that plasma tvs are not that expensive.

@summary
know that most plasmas don't necessarily have the most pixels.

@summary
don't just buy a plasma or other flat panel tv to "save space.",

@summary
be aware that pretty much all hdtv's are "horizontal rectangles" otherwise known as widescreen and have an aspect ratio of 16x9 as opposed to traditional 4x3.

@summary
burn-in is not really an issue with plasmas anymore.

@summary
plasmas are not obsolete.

 Most good 42" plasmas cost about the same as a good 50" DLP or LCD rear projection TV, and they tend to cost less than flat panel LCD's of the same size.;
, The larger (40" and up) flat panel LCD's most often have the highest resolution. While this is important, it is not the MOST IMPORTANT part of a TV.
 This is occasionally a concern of people, but really most people buy a plasma because they want to wall mount a TV.
 This includes high-def LCD's, Plasmas, CRT's, and Projections.
 It can happen, but it is difficult to get, even with video games. If burn-in does occur, it is usually reversible, which is why most experts in the electronic industry now call this "image retention" rather than "burn-in."

, LCD's and plasmas are about the same age as far as the technology goes and the availability to consumers. Additionally, a good plasma does not use much power.
