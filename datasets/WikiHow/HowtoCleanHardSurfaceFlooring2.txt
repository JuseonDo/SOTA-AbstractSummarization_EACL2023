 Wood floors can be vacuumed but this approach is not recommended, especially on real wood (as opposed to engineered or laminate) floors. Vacuuming wood floors can produced scratches.
 Any type of tea will work because the tannic acid in the tea will clean and shine the floors.


Allow tea bags to seep in the boiling water for several minutes before removing.
Don’t use tea until its warm but no longer piping hot (which could burn your skin during use).
 The cloth should be removable and completely clean before using.
 You want the cloth to be wet, but not soaked.
 Don’t over soak the floor or else you will end up with streaks.
