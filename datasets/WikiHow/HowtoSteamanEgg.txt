 Listen for air pockets. They will make a hollow sound. If you find an air pocket, prick the egg there, not automatically at one end.


Do not be surprised if you find more than one air pocket.;
, Add the lid. Put on the cold hotplate.
 The egg is heated gently as the water heats up.
 Keep the lid on and the steam in.
 The timer needs to be set roughly 30 seconds longer than for conventional boiling. When the timer goes off, remove the egg(s) from the pot.
 Serve as for boiled eggs.
