 The lower the concentration of DEET in any bug repellent product, the shorter it will remain effective. While you can apply DEET on children as young as 2 months of age, remember that the lower concentrations of DEET are safer for kids but you will need to reapply DEET more frequently.;
, Remember to reapply sunscreen more frequently when using a DEET product. Only reapply DEET if bugs start bothering you again.
 If using a spray, don't aim it at your face but instead spray it into your hands and rub over your face while avoiding eyes, lips and nostrils. Remember that DEET can burn the eyes and taste unpleasant if ingested.
 Younger children tend to be bothered by insects first. By watching kids, you'll know when the effectiveness of your DEET-based product has diminished. Dusk and dawn are typically the most active times for biting insects to bother people.
 Utilize your product label's instructions and remember its effectiveness ratings to know when you will probably have to apply DEET once again.
 Although DEET is considered safe to use on humans by the Environmental Protection Agency, you should always reduce and eliminate any DEET residue on your skin as soon as possible.
