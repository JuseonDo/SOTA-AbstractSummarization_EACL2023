 The closeness of your relationship should determine your closing sign-off.
, This is extremely common with both personal and professional emails in the United Kingdom and Australia. It is gaining steam in America, but should be saved for people you know very well.


“Ciao” can also be used for a playful end to an email. Remember that it may be seen as pretentious if the person doesn’t know you well enough to understand your tone.
 For succinct emails, the use of a thank you in the signature can help save space.
 Only use it if you are being sincere.
 You can also add “More Soon” if you need to return to the email later.
 For personal emails, use your first name. Between close friends or partners, you may choose to use a nickname or a first initial.
