,, How? One key step is to remove redundancies that occur because each article was originally freestanding.
 A copywriter or editor can easily do this.
 At least one-inch right and left margins because it makes the page easier to read.
 The font size for the text on the page should be at least 11 or 12 points. This is especially true if your ideal clients are over 40 years old. Many people use Arial or Verdana for ebooks since it's easier on the eyes than Times Roman.
 However, you don't want to use the clip art that came with your computer. First that art is for personal, not commercial use. Secondly, you want to look professional and not be thought of as cheap. There are low cost graphics for sale on the Internet for you to use.
 Don't underline titles because people will think that they're supposed to click on them; instead, use bold, color or italics. You can even use special fonts like Tahoma for titles.

Page ii is for testimonials from clients and those who have read and used the ebook.
Page iii is your publisher information page with copyright information. Open a book and you'll see this important page!
Page iv can be used for acknowledgments of others that you'd like to mention.
Page v tells others how to use the ebook.
Page vi is an Introduction to the book, written by you or someone else.
 You may want to consider other ebook software programs to have more security over your content. There are many software review sites available for this purpose.
,, If your ebook is more than 30 pages in a Word Document, chances are you've also created a book!
