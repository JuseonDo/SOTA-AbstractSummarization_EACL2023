 Examples can be formal, casual, princess-themed, or anything you would like. Be sure to include this in the invite.
 Make sure to include when and where the party will be. (For example, Hey, come to my bday party! My den at twelve thirty!),, It should probably one of your friends. Put in a DJ table for him/her. Then, every 5 minutes, switch the song.
