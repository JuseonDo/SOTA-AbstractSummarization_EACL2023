 Write a strict schedule saying when you can play, (e.g Saturday, 1:00-2:00, with breaks.);
, Turn it off, at the wall if you have to, and walk away. Find something else interesting and try to forget all about it!

, It may be hard, but you should be able to get over it. Ask a friend to hold on to the game for a while, hopefully they won't 'join the club'. Then begin finding new things to do.
 They may be able to recommend further course of action you can take.
