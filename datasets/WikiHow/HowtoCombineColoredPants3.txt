 Ankle jeans are especially suited to a neutral heel. The heels will also make you look taller and more svelte.


Men can combine colored pants with neutral oxfords, loafers and low boots to dress up their colored pants.
 Stripes, chevrons, animal prints and floral patterns look splashy next to a bright color. Choose a pattern that has the pants color in them or opt for a black and white pattern.
 Pair warm colors, like pink, yellow, red and orange with gold. Pair cooler colors, like cobalt, green, purple and grey with silver belts, earrings, bracelets and necklaces.
 If you have teal jeans, try an aqua bag. This is especially cute if you have a white or neutral top.
 Semi-precious stones, like rose quartz look great with pink pants. Look through your jewelry box to find coordinating colors and wear them over a white, black, denim or beige shirt.
