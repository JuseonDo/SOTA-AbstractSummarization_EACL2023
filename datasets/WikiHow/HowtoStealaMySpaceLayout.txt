first, go to the target myspace page.

@summary
now, a separate window should appear as soon as you clicked "view source".

@summary
scroll down the page; it may be hard to read but if you get the hang of it you will soon be able to identify all the components of the large page of codes.

@summary
once you have scrolled down try to find this text: about me: .

@summary
when looking for layout codes there is a 7/10 chance that the code is in the "about me".

@summary
copy the code starting where it says <style all the way to the end where it says </style>.

@summary
finally paste the code into your "about me" and look at your new "stolen" layout.

 Depending on which Internet browser you use the way of viewing the page source is fairly the same. Upon arrival to the selected Myspace; right click in an empty space and click "View Source", to view the page's source.;
, What you are looking at may seem like a foreign language and extremely hard to read, unless you know the HTML code setting, but alas it is the key for you to get the layout that you want.
, It indicates that you have reached the "About Me" section and all the codes that inhabit it.
 Scroll down some more, if you don't see the code try looking again, it is very simple to find a layout code just by the "style tags". Style tags are the beginning of the layout code and consists of < and >. If there is writing telling about the person then the code is at the end.
 Now close the page, or leave it up on the screen for future reference or if you lose the code, you have a back to retrieve it.
