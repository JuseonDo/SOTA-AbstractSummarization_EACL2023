 Buy expensive mascara just once; after it runs out, wash and save the brush. The main difference between mascaras is the wand, not the makeup. Apply new, cheaper mascara with the brush that comes with it, then use your old one to fluff and separate your lashes.
 Plump your lips for pennies by mixing a sprinkle of cayenne pepper or cinnamon with a dab of petroleum jelly and applying to lips. It will irritate them just enough to temporarily swell them.
 Often, some inexpensive brands will run coupons in magazines, and newspapers. Cut them and keep them!

, With some water, for example, you can make a free 10 day supply of foundation last for a month.
 Woman cannot live on cheap cosmetics alone!
