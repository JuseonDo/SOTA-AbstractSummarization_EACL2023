 The default boot screen of Windows Vista is a black screen containing just a progress bar and the text Microsoft Corporation. Those of you who are tired of this boring default look of the Windows Vista Boot Screen can enable the hidden boot screen.
Click on the start orb and type in MSCONFIG in the search box and press Enter



 


Once the System Configuration tool loads, click on the Boot tab






Under Boot Options check No GUI boot






Click apply and then OK and restart your computer to see the new boot screen.

Type in Media (without quotation marks)






It will take you to a folder that contains Windows sounds and hidden midi music.

Open Notepad, then type in ".LOG" (all caps without quotes)






Save using any file name and on the file type drop-down menu choose "All files."






Close out Notepad, open the file again and you will find the date and time.
