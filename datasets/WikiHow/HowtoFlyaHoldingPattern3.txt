 The basics are the same as above except a DME distance is used as the holding fix.,,, For example, if you are holding on the 10DME fix to the navaid and flying 5 mile (8.0 km) legs as directed by ATC, you would end the outbound leg at 15 miles (24 km) DME (see diagram above).
If you are holding away from the navaid, subtract the length of the legs from the holding fix. For example, if you are holding on the 20DME fix and flying away from the navaid, end your outbound leg at 25DME.
