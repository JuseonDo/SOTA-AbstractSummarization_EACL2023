Besides bulging in a specific area of the body, symptoms may include back or abdominal pain, severe headaches, vision changes, nausea, clammy skin, rapid heart rate and speech impairment.;
, The doctor diagnoses the condition based on results from an X-ray, a CT scan or an ultrasound.
 This option applies if the aneurysm is less than 1 inch (3 mm) or if surgery would be risky.
, Your doctor can help you determine the correct dose for the medication.
 For more serious cases, your doctor may recommend surgical clipping and endovascular coiling may treat a brain aneurysm.


In endovascular coiling, the surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery to disrupt the aneurysm. In surgical clipping, the doctor inserts a metal clip onto the problem area to stop blood flow to the aneurysm.
, If the aneurysm is small and not ruptured, then the doctor may prescribe beta blockers to lower blood pressure and statins to lower cholesterol.
 In surgery, the doctor will replace the aorta with a fabric graft.
 For this, the doctor uses a small plastic tube to hold open the artery to prevent the aneurysm from becoming worse.
, The doctor may check the aneurysm every year through an ultrasound to monitor progression.



In open repair surgery, the doctor will cut into the abdomen and replace a damaged abdominal vessel with a graft.
 The doctor performs this procedure by inserting a graft without cutting into the abdomen.
