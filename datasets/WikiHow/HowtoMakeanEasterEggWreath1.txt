,, Tie a piece of thread or wire for the hanging part onto the wire somewhere. This will now serve as the top of the wreath.
 Push the wire through the holes that were created to remove the egg's contents.


If using white and brown eggs, thread them in an alternating pattern, such as two white, two brown, or one white, one brown, or every three, etc.
