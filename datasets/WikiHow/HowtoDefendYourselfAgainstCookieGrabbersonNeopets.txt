, Firefox provides the best add-ons and is also the browser most people recommend for Neopets. You may also want to install Adblock Plus, as there could theoretically be advertisements that also steal cookies.
 Do not go to sites you don't recognize, and don't follow links sent to you by people you don't know.
 Proceed to do a virus scan of your computer. Also, check if your email is still correct.
 Pins will protect your items and stop a scammer pounding your pets. Even if someone gets in your account, any area of the site that you have the ability to place a PIN number on should be safe, as it currently seems that PIN numbers can not be stolen through cookie grabbers.
