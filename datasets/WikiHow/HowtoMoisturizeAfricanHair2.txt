 Go through your normal shampoo routine using your moisturizing shampoo. Rinse the product from your hair and towel dry it so that it is damp before you begin the deep conditioning.
 Use a hot oil treatment or other deep conditioners that have natural oils or fats such as shea butter, argan oil and coconut oil. Apply the deep conditioner from root to tip, concentrating on the ends., After you've evenly applied the deep conditioner to all of your hair, take a soft towel and carefully wrap your hair securely in a turban-style.
 Getting back in the bath and relaxing is always an option, of course! Just make sure you don't get hair wet and that it remains securely wrapped up in the towel for the full half hour.
 Repeat this deep conditioning method twice per month for best results.Regular use of this treatment will make your hair stronger and softer.
