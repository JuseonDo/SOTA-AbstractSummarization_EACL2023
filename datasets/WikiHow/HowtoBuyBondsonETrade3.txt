Buy Treasury bonds at auction by clicking on the "Treasury Auction" page and entering the number of bonds you want to buy. Select the Treasury issue you wish to purchase from the list of options. Preview your order and then click "Place Order" when you're ready.
,, Input that number on the "Set Price" screen.

Pay attention to minimum-denomination requirements. If the price you enter does not meet those requirements, you will be notified when you preview your order. For example, you must buy a full bond, not a fraction of a bond. They come in denominations starting at $1,000. Some bond dealers require a minimum purchase of as much as $10,000.
, Whether you bought Treasury bonds at auction or placed an order for other bonds, you will be notified of that trade as soon as it goes through. It should take only a few minutes.
