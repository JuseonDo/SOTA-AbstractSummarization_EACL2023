 In order to perform this method, you will need to enter the Recovery Console, which can only be accessed with a Windows Vista installation or recovery disc.


You can download a Windows Vista ISO file and burn it to a DVD. The installation disc doesn't need to be the one you use to install your operating system, but it does need to be for the same version of Windows.
,, When the POST screen (the screen that appears before the loading bar shows up and usually displays the computer manufacturer's logo) appears, press the button indicated by it to enter your BIOS setup.

, This will start the Setup program.
, This is located in the bottom-left corner of the Install Windows screen. After clicking, wait a few moments while the Setup program locates your Windows installation.
 Make a note of which drive Windows is installed on. This is typically the C: drive, but it may be on the D: drive.
, Press Enter.


If your copy of Windows is installed on the D: drive, replace c: with d:.
 Press Enter.



This will give you the ability to load the command prompt from the login screen without having to start Windows.
 Allow Windows to reboot as it normally would.
 Instead of opening the Accessibility options, the Command Prompt will open., Press Enter. Replace username with the user you want to change, and newpassword with the new password.


For example: net user Administrator newpassword1

If your username has a space in it, put quotes around it (e.g. net user "John Doe" password).
 As soon as you run the command, your new password will be ready to go. You can use it to log in immediately.
 Once you are back into Windows, you can create a password recovery disk so that you can avoid problems like this in the future. Using the disk will allow you to quickly retrieve your lost password. See this guide for detailed steps on creating and using the disk.
