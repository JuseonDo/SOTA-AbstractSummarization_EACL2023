to mark a square that may have a mine, draw a red flag or triangle over it.

@summary
have your friend outline a square when s/he wants to dig up a square.

@summary
game is over.
@article
 Question marks can also be drawn.



If the square has a number on it, reveal that number only. If it’s a non-border square, repeat steps 10-14, using the square that your friend chose as your “chosen square.”
If it’s a mine, then either your friend lost, or you made a mistake in making the game. (See warnings.)

, The game ends when all the numbers on your cheat sheet are uncovered on your friend’s grid.
