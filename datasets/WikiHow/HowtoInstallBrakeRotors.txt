@summary
park the vehicle on a level surface.

@summary
start with the front wheels by placing wheel hocks (they prevent the car from rolling backwards) behind the rear wheels.

@summary
apply pressure to the jack till it makes contact with the vehicle.

@summary
once the jack has made contact with the vehicle loosen the bolts that hold the wheel on.

@summary
continue jacking up the vehicle till the wheel is approximately 3 inches (7.6Â cm) off the ground.

@summary
what is in front of you now is the brake rotor, brake caliper & bracket.

@summary
once the caliper is removed you must now remove the caliper bracket.

@summary
remove the rotor!,

@summary
installation is the exact reversal of this procedure.
@article
 Remove the keys from the vehicle and make sure the gear selector is in PARK and set the parking brake (this locks the rear wheels which means you must work on the front wheels first), for a manual transmission the vehicle should be in 1st gear with the parking brake set.;
, Place a jack under the front of the vehicle on what ever side you choose to work on first. The jack should be placed either at the designated jack point or under the frame. If you choose to work on the driver's side wheel first place the jack behind that wheel.
 Be sure the jack is placed in a spot that it won't slip from, or damage the vehicle.
 DO NOT REMOVE THEM, just loosen them.
 Remove the bolts that hold on the wheel (lug nuts) and remove the wheel.
 The goal now is to remove the caliper. The caliper is held on by two bolts. The size of the bolts vary, in our reference vehicle the bolts are 6mm hex head bolts. Unscrew these bolts. The caliper can now be removed. Depending on the age of the vehicle you are working on it could take a fair bit of muscle to get the caliper off. I suggest wiggling it back and forth. There is pressure on the rotor from the pads which is what will cause the caliper to be tough to remove.
 Generally this will be held on by two bolts. Remove these bolts and the bracket can be removed.
 If your rotor is kept in place by a screw or clip, this must be removed first, then the rotor will come off. If it has been a while since the rotors have been replaced the old rotors may need some persuasion to come off. Hitting the rotor with a rubber hammer should do the trick.
 To make the installation of the caliper a little easier try using a C clamp to push back the piston in the caliper, this relieves the pressure and makes the fit over the rotor much easier.
