 This prevents having to learn which one is which! Try to get to know who is who by paying close attention to personalities and physical attributes.
 You can take them to a park, but make sure it isn't too cold or dark and the parents are okay with it. You can also try finger painting, sorting games, singing and dancing, making music, and reading books together.
 It allows the twins to let go of anger. Keep a good eye on both and don't make them if they don't want to.
 They may need immediate attention, may feel jealous hurt, or angry, or could get into something.
 Treat them like you're there to hang out with them instead to just boss them around.
