you now have a mutant pet!
@article
 Go to the Rainbow Pool in Neopia Central and look at all of the Mutant pets before deciding which kind you want.;
, Now, type in the search box "*desired pet species* Transmogrification Potion". So if you wanted a Mutant Lupe, you would type in "Lupe Transmogrification Potion". Look at the different prices/trades that people want. Most are around 300-900k.
 This will take a LONG time, so don't be impatient. Find some games you are good at and play them as much as possible. Do your dailies, spin the Wheels, and buy cheap food like omelettes and jellies to save NP. PUT IT ALL IN THE BANK.
 Some people are willing to haggle, and others offer discounted prices. Look around a little, and then make the offer!

, Feed it to the pet that you want to be Mutant.
 Congratulations!
