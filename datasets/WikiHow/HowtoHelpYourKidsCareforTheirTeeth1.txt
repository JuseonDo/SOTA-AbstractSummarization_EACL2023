 Either a manual or powered is fine. Make sure the bristles are soft and rounded when choosing a toothbrush for a child.;
, If the child is not old enough to spit after brushing, use even less toothpaste or skip it altogether and just wet the toothbrush with water.
 Brush all surfaces of the teeth, including the back and sides.
 Set a timer or play a favorite song to make sure your child brushes for the full amount of time.
 The brushing isn't complete until all of the plaque is removed.
 Some toothbrushes have colored bristles that fade when it's time to replace the brush. If bristles are fraying before 3 months, replace the brush to prevent damage to the gums from frayed bristles.
