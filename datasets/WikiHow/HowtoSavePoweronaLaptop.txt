 To do this, look for a purple "Fn" button on the keyboard (usually next to the left ctrl key, sometimes the key has blue lettering instead of purple). After you've found the "Fn" button, quickly search for another key with a purple or blue sun with an up or down arrow(usually on the arrow keys or on one of the F1-F12 keys). Now while holding "Fn" press the button with the purple/blue sun and a down arrow. (Please note some computers do not have an Fn button so if your computer does not have an Fn button in that case, just simply use one of the F1-F12 keys alone)

,,, The disc will still be spinning inside and consumes a ton of energy.
 Check your owners manual to see how.
 Many of these devices draw power from your USB port, up to 500mA (about a half an Amp) and 5 volts. It adds up quickly depending on how many you have plugged in.
 This will only leave dire essential components in the computer running such as the memory. And allow you to resume working on your computer quickly.
 It will have the same effect as turning the computer off, but it will allow you to go back to working on your laptop just like in standby and uses little to no power from the battery.
