 For example, whole wheat bread is better than white bread because processing white bread requires removing the natural nutrients contained in wheat. Whole wheat products are also better for your digestion.


The definition of nutritious food is: Food that is a significant source of fiber, vitamins, and (preferably) organic substances. Organic and whole foods are more nutritious than processed foods. Processed foods have been stripped of their nutrients, leaving them unhealthy to eat.;
, You might want to put this on your refrigerator as a reminder.


Avoid food with saturated or trans fats. Low-sodium foods are also more healthy. Look for food rich in fiber and calcium. Eating less sugar is also important.
 This may be:


a store solely devoted to whole foods
a local produce market (You can support local farmers, too!)
certain sections in your supermarket that stock dairy, whole grain/wheat products, and organic fruit and vegetables.



You can find a helpful shopping checklist here.
 Change things up by packing a sandwich one day, a salad on another day, or even leftovers from last night’s dinner (be sure that it is healthy).
 For some healthy alternatives to sugary delights, go to HealthFinder.
 You might also want to purchase insulated bags so that your lunch stays fresh.
 Treat it like a ritual. This will help you get into the habit of bringing your own healthy lunch. Soon you will find yourself uninterested in going out for a more expensive lunch or eating less healthy food.


Some people do this right after dinner or before bed. Morning people might want to prepare things during or after morning coffee or tea.
 This way they will "learn by doing," be able to bring a nutritious lunch to school, and get into the habit of eating well, too.
