 You will want to have a landscape type of photo, and something with parts of it that can be brought out using blurring.;
,, This will open up the dialog with several sliders.


Don't start out with adjusting the blurriness. Leave that for later.
 You will need to adjust the rotation. To do this, select which part of the image that you want to be clear. Here, +18 degrees is the correct angle, and the intended blurred area is at the back of one row of cars.
 In this image, the area between the cars is the objective.
 What that does is change the degree of gradient in the blur at the edge.
 Decide, at this time, if you want more or less blur.
