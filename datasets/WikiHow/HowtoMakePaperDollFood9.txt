 Brown and golden yellow are the best colors. If you don't have colored paper, you can always paint some paper before it's done., Use an image to guide your shaping., Follow the packaging instructions for when to paint., A plate can be made from a bottle lid, cardboard circle, or use a miniature doll's plate.
