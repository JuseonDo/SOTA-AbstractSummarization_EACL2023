 You'll also need a post or a spindle from a chair or other furniture item (or purchase one from the hardware store).
 Use caulking to do this. Allow to set properly before proceeding.
 You won't be able to do this once the cup and saucer are attached, although the alternative is to dig the hole first, then simply insert the pole or spindle (which you'll need to do if you want to move this object around).
 Do this so as to center the teacup and saucer evenly on the pole or spindle. Allow to dry completely.
 Let the birds come.


Note: When it rains, this item will fill up with rainwater. That will make a nice bath for the birds but you should remove soggy birdseed from it.
