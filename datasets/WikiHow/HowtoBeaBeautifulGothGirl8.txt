rivet heads, or industrial goths, often do not consider themselves “goths,” although their preferred music and fashion can be found in the same shops and they’ll happily go to goth clubs.

however, in the modern era the industrial scene has come to resemble a dark, rough, dystopian version of the cyber scene.

industrial fashion is somewhat like cyber in its futuristic appearance but is generally more monochrome, less polished and often has a military influence.

 The scene all started with the band Throbbing Gristle forming their own label, Industrial Records, for a new genre of extremely weird experimental electronic music. For some Rivet Heads, this is the only “real” Industrial music - bands like SPK and The Leather Nun which spawned from this scene of the early 80s.
 The modern Rivethead may listen to Darkwave bands resembling a heavier form of EBM (Wumpscut, Skinny Puppy), or even the commercial “Industrial Metal” bands (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, KMFDM).
 It is also undeniable that Sc-Fi movies such as The Matrix have inspired the look of many Rivet Heads - a lot of them will refuse to remove their trenchcoats even in the sweatiest clubs.
