@summary
on the first round, let the zombies break down the barriers.

@summary
shoot 'em up.

@summary
go out by the pm63 (but don't buy it), and open the next door for 1000.

@summary
after about 3 rounds here (so about 5-7) you should have the points to pass up the mp5k in the next room and go straight to the power.

@summary
have one person in the back by the window grab claymores and the m16, and the other needs the m16 and the mp40 from earlier, and they should take the front.

@summary
,

@summary
the person in back can place claymores against the wall to save them for later, and also provide a few facing the other person as a backup space for when they need some breathing room.

@summary
so, you can help the guy in front thin the zombies coming from the dressing room, allow your clay by the window you were guarding go off, then need to use the backup, replace them all, and still have claymores to spare.

@summary
,

@summary
you can trade off on the door or window, or let the more skilled player take the front while the other handles the window.

@summary
leave out (turn the power on) only when you have at least enough for jugg and the bowie knife (so around 7000 each.),

@summary
now, use the knife to take care of any crawlers, as it should be around a one hit kill or a shot or two and a one hit kill.

@summary
a this point, the accepted strategy is to run the level counterclockwise from the start to the theater, through the middle, and repeat.

@summary
simply open the area to the alleyway (through the back door of the stage toward the ak74u) and post up by the door in the back.

@summary
,

@summary
do not open this door!,

@summary
sit back by double tap and watch that window.

@summary
using this strategy (and leaving a stubbs* at the end of a round to hit the box, upgrade, etc.)
@article
 Don't worry, they are REALLY slow. Simply knife every zombie once for a cool, easy 130 points each. To maximise the amount of points you receive per zombie, you should shoot them in the leg four times and then knife them. An easy 170 points a kill. At this rate you should have your first grand in no time.;
, This round is also very easy, if you are good with a pistol. You will want to go for chest shots, and drop 4 rounds into each zombie (same strategy as before, but chest shots do more damage). A knife will then kill them.


Every level thereafter, it will take an additional 4 shots and the stab to kill them, so a whole clip and a stab on level 3 (note that it is possible to kill them with only a clip with occasional headshots).
After round 3, it is slightly dangerous to keep with the pistol, as you'll need to either get consistent headshots or reload for each zombie, however it does still get points like crazy.
At the end of round 2, you should have the points to open the top door.
 This leads you to the MP40 and Stakeout. One person takes the top by the window and the table, and the other can watch the two windows on the bottom. All the zombies will walk toward the person on the top, so the bottom person can use the pistol to rack up points. The person on top is recommended to take the MP40, but nobody should grab the Stakeout.
 DO NOT TURN IT ON. This is the best place to rack up points in the level.
, When you save claymores, it allows you to use more than two when the situation calls for it.
, It all depends on how you prefer to play.


, The reason the Bowie Knife is a necessity is because the crawlers will not explode when you kill them with it. Plus, it make the Ballistic knife ridiculously powerful when stabbing.
 This should get you to a high round by itself. However, if you dislike crawlers enough to merit buying the bowie knife, you can get rid of them entirely here.
, This is crucial.
 One player (with monkey bombs and a thundergun) sits by the door and shoots the zombies coming down the alley. This player RUNS THEIR GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF AMMO TO RELOAD. Failing to do so will open the door, causing crawlers to pour in and zombies spawning behind your group. The other two stand facing down the alley in line with chain link fence.
 you can permanently rid yourselves of the crawlers. Using these simple methods, you can have fun, help your team, and not seem like a total douche in online zombies. Read on for more helpful tips on how to be an efficient, number crunching zombies player.
