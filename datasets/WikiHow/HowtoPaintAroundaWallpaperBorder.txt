Clean the border with a damp cloth if it’s dirty and let it dry.
Look at the edges and seams to make sure they are flat and adhered to the wall. Repair any curling or loose places with a little wallpaper paste and let them dry.;
,, Try to make your cut lines as straight as possible.


Cut through the paper while it’s on the role if you can to save time. Slide out the cardboard tube most paper is rolled on to make it easier to cut.
If you unroll the paper to cut it, you will need to measure and mark the roll as you unwind it so that you get a straight line when you cut.
 Line the bottom edge of the cut paper up to the bottom edge of the wallpaper border so that about 1/8” (1/3 cm) of the border is showing at the bottom.

The tape should cover the tiny edge of border paper left showing but not extend beyond it.
Make sure there are no gaps, bubbles or curled areas along the edge of the tape.
At the corners overlap the papers slightly.
, Use a brush or trim size paint roller.


Try not to get much paint on the paper covering the border. Large amounts of paint might seep through or under the paper.
Make sure the paint line is slightly over the tape. That is so there will be none of the old paint color showing when you lift the tape off.
