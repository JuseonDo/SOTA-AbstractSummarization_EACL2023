 It may be hard for you to tell people about how Asperger's Syndrome affects you. However, there are situations where it is necessary for you to tell people that you have Asperger's Syndrome and how it affects you.;
, Some people with Asperger's may not be very social, but most are extremely intelligent.
 Tell them that it is neither. If they still think of it as such, walk away from them.
 After explaining to the person about Asperger's Syndrome ask them if you can hang out with them or just be around them more often.
 Remember that you are here for a reason. The people who are insecure or feel uncomfortable about Asperger's are most likely like that about themselves.
