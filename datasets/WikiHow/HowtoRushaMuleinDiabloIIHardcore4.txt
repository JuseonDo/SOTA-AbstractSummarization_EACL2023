for diablo: kill everything.

, Try not to do all portals; if you do, no sweat, it's just easier to position your mule in a safe spot before you summon Diablo. There is a corner northwest of the pentagon that you can tuck the mule away in. And yes, the mule needs to be down there when you kill Diablo. Kill Diablo. The mule will take portal to act five.
