 This circular box and its lid could make two zoetropes, or you could make a thaumatrope with the other piece.

,, The size of the hole should be should be a lot bigger than the diameter of your marble. Make sure the hole is centered on the bottom of the box.
, Remove the tape from the bottom surface of the glass bead, as shown. There are various methods, but the idea is to make the box spin like a top.
 The paper strip should be the same length as the circumference of the circle (i.e. enough to go around without any gaps or overlapping). Remember, the box will be spinning, so you might want to make the pictures go in a loop (so that the last one is also similar to the first).
 Make them the same distance apart as the pictures. Make the black paper strip smaller than the container.
,, Look through the slits in the black paper to the pictures on the opposite side, and spin the box on the marble, like a top.
