 This can save much-needed battery life for more important situations.
 The heat can break/melt the lubricating greases, which will seep through and damage hardware. Camera parts will also expand when they get hot.
 Both extremes of temperature can be permanently damaging to cameras. Keep the camera warm in cold conditions, and cool in hotter temperatures.
 These are more often than not supplied with cameras and are another vital part for safety. If small, stylish, point-and-shoot cameras are what you use, perhaps this is not for you. However, with larger cameras, a strap is necessary to avoid the consequences of sudden moments when the camera slips out of your hand.
