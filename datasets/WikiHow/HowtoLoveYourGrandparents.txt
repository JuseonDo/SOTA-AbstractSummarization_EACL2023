 Don't get upset if they say no. Usually you'll get a yes from them, but sometimes they have to say no. They want to pamper you, but sometimes they just can't. Don't argue with them and never say rude things to them.;
, Grandparents have feelings too, and you can make them feel great just by caring about them. Remember their birthdays and other special days. Give them a card, you can make the card or buy one.
 Tell them what's going on in your life, and find out what's going on in their lives. This is how you get closer to them and make a stronger bond.
 Your grandparents have been around a long time. They've learned a lot. Sometimes they've learned the hard way, and their experiences can help you avoid the mistakes they made when they were young.
 Don't wait to be asked, just help. They might not feel comfortable about asking for help.
 Give them a hug too, grandparents love that.
 This can be going out somewhere, playing a game, helping them cook, learning about a hobby they like, or sharing a hobby you like. It's fun to surprise them sometimes too, maybe you can make a card when they aren't expecting it, just because you love them. This will make them very happy. You can even send a card in the mail.
 Tell them about problems you're having. They love you and have a lot of experience to help get you through the hard times and make the right decisions.
 Show them you're grateful to them for their good advice. When something goes right because you followed their advice, call them and tell them about it. They want to know if you're alright.
