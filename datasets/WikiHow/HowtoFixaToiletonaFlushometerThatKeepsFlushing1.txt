depending on whether your flushometer is facing left or right, there should be a slot for a flat screwdriver on either side.

@summary
take a wrench and screw the top lid of the flushometer off.

@summary
take the flange cover off.

@summary
you will now see a gasket, which will have a lot of sediment.

@summary
take out and clean the gasket, including the weep hole.follow steps 1 to 5 in reverse order (skipping the cleaning part, as you have already cleaned) to get the toilet working again, leaving it good as new.if this solution didn't work, you will need to replace the gasket.
@article
 Take a flat screwdriver and use it to turn the screwdriver slot and shut off the water from the flushometer.

You may also need to take a cover off where the screwdriver slot is too.;
, You only need a wrench to loosen the top lid of the flushometer. After that, the lid screws right off.

It may also be necessary to use a piece of paper when doing so, so that you don't scrape the chrome on the flushometer.
 Be warned that you may make a mess with some water when taking this cover off.,

There also may be a tiny weep hole too, which is what is causing the suction to release and the vacuum to seal up, also causing the flushometer to not be able to stop running the water into the toilet.
 Clean it really well. You also will want to wash it out too.

Something very tiny in width should be used to clean the port of the weep hole.
