;
, Fry the flour in the bacon grease until it turns golden brown. If you don't fry the flour enough the gravy will taste like wallpaper paste. However try not to burn it.









Variation: You may use cornmeal, flour, and extra pepper.
 If you add the milk too quickly the gravy will not thicken properly and you will get little clumps of fried flour in some funky milk concoction which is not very appetizing.









Another option is to add water (instead of milk) to the flour once it's browned. Cook to a little thicker than you want it. Remove from heat and then add evaporated milk.
 (! I don't add the salt until the gravy is finished cooking because it tends to cause the gravy to "curdle.")
