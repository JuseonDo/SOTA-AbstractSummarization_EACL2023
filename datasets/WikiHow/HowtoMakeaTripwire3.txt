 You'll need a clothespin, an electronic buzzer, a lithium battery, two-sided adhesive pads, a twist tie, fishing line, and a small piece of copper tape., Use the twist tie to squeeze the ends together. You want to hold the clothespin open., Use the copper tape to cover one of the open ends, wrapping it around the top. Smooth it down to the wood., Use the adhesive pad. Use one sticky side to stick the red wire to the copper on the top of the clothespin., Use the other sticky side to stick the buzzer to the top of the clothespin., Place the stick pad on the inside of the clothespin mouth. Put it on the side without the copper. Stick the black wire to the top of it., With the negative side towards the black wire, stick it down to the black wire. Center the wire on the battery., The cardboard should be thin and about an inch wide and long. Poke a hole with a needle., Use fishing wire. Tie a string around the hole., Release the twist tie at the back of the clothespin. The string side should be near the mouth of the clothespin.Pull out the cardboard to test the clothespin. See if it buzzes. Place the cardboard back inside the mouth.
 Use adhesive pads to stick up the clothespin. Run the tripwire across the doorway. Tape it up on the other side of the doorway. Make sure it's taut but not taut enough to pull out the cardboard without much pressure., When someone crosses the tripwire, it pulls out the cardboard. The clothespin will close, connecting the circuit. The buzzer will sound.
