 It doesn't matter what menu, just a song.;
, You should notice that the menu for the song is still there but there aren't any seconds left.
, Press play. You should notice it is playing the next song, with the same menu as the previous. If you try to rewind the song and press play though, it will pop back to that spot in the previous song.
