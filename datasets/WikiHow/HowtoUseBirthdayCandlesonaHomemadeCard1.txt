 Is it someone specialâ€™s birthday or an anniversary? You can use the birthday candle strategy for just about any card, just have your intent in mind before you design.


Decide how you will use the birthday candles. You can create words, pictures or top a hand drawn birthday cake with your real candles.;
, Pre-used candles covered in old cake or melted wax should either be recycled or tossed. Only use new candles that you can match to your card design.


Consider the size of the blank card in relation to the candles you plan to use.
 You may also want to use a stencil to create the lettering or free hand the card.
 Get the creative juices flowing and design your card using a variety of elements.
 A hot glue gun will help adhere the birthday candles to the card and a simple glue stick will work with magazine photos.
