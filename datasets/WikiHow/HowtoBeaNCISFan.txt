 There's no sense whatsoever in trying to become a 'fan' of a show you've never watched.;
, You may want to know more about Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo, Ziva David, Timothy "McGeek, McKillJoy, Probie Wan Kenobi" McGee, Abigail "Abby" Sciuto, Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard, Leroy Jethro "Gibbs" Gibbs and James "Jimmy" Palmer.
, It will help you understand the episode better. For example, Tony DiNozzo frequently refers to and quotes movies. Abby is addicted to Caf-Pow, a high-energy caffeine drink. Gibbs is serious about his coffee.
, Pay attention to the interaction between characters, relationships and back-stories, subtle jokes, innuendos and other smaller factors that make the acting so fantastic to watch.
 Donald B. Bellisario created NCIS, and he also created other hit shows such as JAG and Magnum P.I.
, It's really catchy!
