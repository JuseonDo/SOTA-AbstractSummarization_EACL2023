in the dryer use the gentlest and coolest cycle and check the blanket every 20 minutes to ensure that you do not leave it longer than it needs in order to dry.

if fabric cling is an issue with the blanket, use a clean tennis ball or similar drying ball to keep the blanket moving in the dryer.

 The dryer is another source of friction and so you may wish to further limit the tumbling time by removing the blanket damp and line drying.
 This will also speed drying time and tends to fluff the fabric.







Ideally, for a long blanket life and to prolong softness, line drying outside is the preferred drying method. It removes the friction and fabric damage that occurs during the tumbling action of a dryer.
