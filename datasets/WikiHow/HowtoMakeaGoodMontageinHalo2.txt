 DO NOT record video with a video camcorder, it just doesn't work. A spectacular example of an HD capture card is the Hauppauge HD PVR.;
,, It can be anything from rock to rap or electro to screamo. Just make it something that is meaningful to you and that showcases the gameplay.
 Lets say the track has a part where there are five strong beats in a row. An example would be to put 5 sniping headshots in a row right there.
 You will want to move clips around to get a good effect. Remember, the key is editing.
 Common examples are color correction, glows, masks, and transitions. Try to stay away from over-used, gaudy effects like lens-flares or pre-made effects. Remember, more is not always better. Focus on syncing the footage with the music before adding complicated effects.
, You will want to publish your video to popular hosting sites to be seen. Some popular sites are: Video Google, Yahoo Video, Youtube. Do not spam links to your video everywhere. If people enjoy it, they will watch.
 Learn from any negative comments, but do not necessarily listen to them all.
