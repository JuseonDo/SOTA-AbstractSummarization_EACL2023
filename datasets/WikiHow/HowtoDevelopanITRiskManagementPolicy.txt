Consider your servers, computers, data, smart phones, routers, software, emails, files, networks, and website.;

Common or newly identified vulnerabilities can often be identified with the help of online forums and IT networking sites.
Consider threats from humans (hackers, competitors, user errors), technical systems (crashes, overloads, viruses), and the environment (natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes).



Consider the loss of access, confidentiality, and reputation in connection with potential breaches. Any interruption in commerce, lawsuit, or breach of trust can be quantified as a cost.
,, Multiply that figure by the estimated occurrence rate to come up with the long-term cost of each control.

Designing a form for all users to fill out will ensure that the same data are collected on each evaluation and incident for future planning and evaluation purposes.



Appointing one department or job position to head up the evaluation process can ensure timeliness and accountability.
 Evaluate its effectiveness, revising and editing the plan as necessary, particularly in response to any changes in business processes or to the risk environment..


Risk management should be talked about and viewed as a continuous process that underlies all decisions and practices throughout the organization.
