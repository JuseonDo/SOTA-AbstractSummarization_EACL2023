, On the screen that appears, you will see a section like this:

, Please note that no matter how many times you click on the second and third items from the top, they will remain gray X marks. Only click on red X marks, and click them all until they are replaced by green checks. When the screen looks like what is shown above, click "Proceed." On the screen that appears, you will see a section like this:

, (Please note that it doesn't matter whether there is a green check or a red X next to "Search for negligible risk entries.") The scan will begin, and the next screen that appears will feature lots of file names and other gibberish that flashes by very quickly. You can safely ignore all of this. As the scan progresses, you will probably see something like this:

, As the scanner finds each problem, the count of "critical objects" will go up. The picture above shows 41 problems found, but you may have many more.
 When the scan is complete, you will see something like this on the screen:

, Click "Next." On the screen that appears, you will see a section like this:

, To do that, right-click (click with the right mouse button) on any of the listings. It doesn't matter which listing you right-click on. After you right-click, a menu will pop up. It looks like this:

, This places a checkmark next to all of the spyware files found by Ad-Aware. Your screen should now look like this:

, The box shown below will appear:

, A box will appear that says "Quarantining selection," followed by a box which says "Deleting selection." Both of these boxes will disappear on their own. You don't need to click anything else. After the "Quarantining" and "Deleting" boxes disappear, you will see the full Ad-Aware screen again. You can now close the program, you are finished!
