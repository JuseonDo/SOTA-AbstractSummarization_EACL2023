, Chop the ends off the asparagus. Get out platter and lay bacon flat on it.
 Make bundles of about 4-6 pieces wrapped in bacon. Put two toothpicks through each bundle so they won't come undone.
 Paint lightly with the mixture of olive oil and seasonings. Sprinkle on some lemon pepper.
 Let it heat until it's at 400 °F (204 °C).
, Flip after 5-7 minutes. Paint lightly with the olive oil mixture. Flip again after 6 minutes, and again if needed. Keep the bundles on the grill until the bacon is cooked and crispy and the asparagus is tender.
