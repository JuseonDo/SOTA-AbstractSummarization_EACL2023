 Don't put up with crap from other people. Slash is rebellious.;
, Play guitar. An important thing is that Slash plays guitar, so get a Gibson Les Paul (which run around $3000) or you can get an Epiphone Les Paul, which is much cheaper (maybe $500).
 Slash has been inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.
 Slash wears leather pants and a leather coat. Top hat and aviator glasses are his signature style (if you can, don't use the same combination; it wouldn't be original anymore and would decrease your guitarist reputation).
, Slash's real name is Saul Hudson.
 His is a Les Paul. Make sure you know what you're doing or you could do permanent damage to your guitar.
, Slash has long, curly/frizzy hair. If your hair grows naturally straight, curl it! If your hair grows curly, obviously, leave it alone!!!
