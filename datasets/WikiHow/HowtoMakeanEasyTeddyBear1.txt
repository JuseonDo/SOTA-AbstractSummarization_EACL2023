 It doesn't necessarily have to be a bear; it can be a tiger, a dog, even something like a crocodile (if you want a challenge).;
, Draw a simple template of the teddy and then cut it out! Put the pieces of felt together when you cut so the size of the teddy is identical on either side.
 etc.
, Remember to leave a space to put in the stuffing!

, A teddy isn't a teddy without stuffing- that's why they are sometimes called 'Stuffed Animals'! Don't worry if you don't have proper stuffing, you can use anything; bits of material or even a pair of old socks!

,, It could be anything- Bubblegum, Cookie, Pinky, Blue, Pebbles or a made up word.
 Sleep with it, make it clothes, make it a... den?
