 Check the shirt's label for bleaching instructions, looking carefully for “non-chlorine bleach only.”


When an shirt requires non-chlorine bleach, you must use oxygen bleach or hydrogen peroxide to whiten it.Note if the shirt has a label indicating that it should not be bleached. In this case, you should choose a different shirt that can be bleached.;
, Depending on the clothing you are washing, you want to be sure to choose the correct settings so as not to shrink or otherwise ruin the clothing.
 As your washer fills with water, add the appropriate amount of detergent for the size of the load. The water will begin to bubble when the detergent is added.



It is recommended that the wash cycle run for five minutes before adding bleach for best results.Use a dedicated measuring cup if your washer does not have a bleach dispenser. Do not use this measuring cup for any other purpose.
 It is now time to let the washer run its cycle with the clothing in it, including your shirt.
 If the shirt is whitened or brightened to your satisfaction, dry it according to the label (i.e. tumble dry, hang dry, et cetera). If the shirt is not yet as white or bright as you would like it to be, then it is recommended that you put it through another cycle with bleach.
