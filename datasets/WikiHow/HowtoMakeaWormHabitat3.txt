Make a cover of some sort, such as from a plastic sheet.
 You can also add shredded newspaper, old hay or straw.
 The soil should be light and of good quality. Add the soil in sprinkles, lifting the bedding now and then to create air spaces.
 For example, vegetable scraps and coffee grounds.
 Cover with a layer of well rotted compost. Cover the container.
 Feed the worms half their body weight per day; any more than this and the food will go off and smell bad.
