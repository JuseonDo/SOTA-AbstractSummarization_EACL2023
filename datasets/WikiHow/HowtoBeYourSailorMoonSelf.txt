 If you love Usagi/Serena's hair, try it out with your own hair or extensions! Or create your own unique hairstyle, then wear it out and smile to everyone you meet!;
, Usagi/Serena is a fashionista at heart, Rei Hino (Sailor Mars) is a singer, Lita is a chef and Mina is a pop star; you can be absolutely anything you put your mind to! Don't limit yourself, to one idea... Ever! Okay?

, Smiling brings you encouragement, so you encourage yourself and others with an honest smile.
 Put on your favorite song and be right here, right now; dancing freely whether you're alone or not. Find a comfortable place and let go of all anxiety!

, No matter what happens, always believe in yourself and never give up on your dreams! Because they will come true, with hard work and sacrifice!

, Also don't give up on the friends you have, because they love you; they truly do!

, Because let's face it, numbers are in everything... So you might as well learn to love them!

, It may seem intense and hard, but just give yourself a few minutes to catch your breath and smile, of course!

, Again, don't worry and appreciate the accomplishments you have made in your life... Because although a drive for greatness is wonderful, don't negatively frame your other accomplishments and celebrate the small glories you have made!

, Don't let society or your own ego, make you seem better or worse.. Because cockiness has two sides, whether people realize it or not! You can cockily depressed or cockily arrogant. And neither are good, because you are simply feeding your insecurities; which no-one, especially not you needs that! So remember, smile and yes it's okay to dust your shoulders off; but don't punch your shoulders either!Â ;-D!!

, There are many articles on wikiHow, to help you with this.. And I recommend most of them, but more importantly you should define happiness for yourself and love your own definition; as well as your own personality! And remember, DO NOT WORRY!!
