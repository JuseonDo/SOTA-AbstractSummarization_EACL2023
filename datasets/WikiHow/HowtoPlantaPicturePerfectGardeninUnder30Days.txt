, Add some fertilizer and peat moss to loosen the soil and add nutrients, and mix it in well.
 Always dig a hole that's bigger than the plant's root ball.
 Stores like Home Depot offer a fair selection of plants and flowers at reasonable prices.
,, (If the soil is dry, water it so it comes out of the pot easily.) Holding your hand on the top of the soil ball, knock out the plant and the roots; gently loosen the roots with your fingers before you place them in the ground.
 Take a sharp clean knife and cut off a section of the plant with attached roots.
 The tag on the plants will tell you the size of the plant when it's fully grown, so leave some space around them so they won't be too crowded.


Once you've placed your plants in the ground, fill in the space around them with fresh soil and tamp down the ground with your foot.
 Be sure to water them daily for a week or so until the roots are established.
 This is especially important for flowering plants. You should soon have a beautiful, radiant garden all your own! You can use water soluble fertilizer that you mix in with the water, or attach directly to your garden hose when you water. There are also timed release fertilizer you mix in with the soil - they will last for an entire season. You can also use plain cow or sheep manure, which is inexpensive and a good all-around fertilizer for all types of plants.
