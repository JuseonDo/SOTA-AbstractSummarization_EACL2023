@article
 Air plants can be displayed by tying them to a piece of driftwood, cork or rock with nylon fishing line.


They can also be glued to the wood or rock with hot glue or construction glue.
 A decorative bowl filled with interesting rocks can be a fitting home for an air plant. Simply nestle the air plant on the rocks or glue it to a rock and set it in the center. They can be nestled in a decorative seashell for an interesting display.
 Covering the base of the plant will keep it too wet and can make it rot.
