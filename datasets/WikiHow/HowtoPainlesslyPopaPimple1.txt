 Do not try to pop a pimple that is deep in the skin, painful, shiny, or red. Instead, wait until you see a hard, white bump on top of the pimple. This white-head is pus gathering near the surface of the skin.


Popping a pimple before it is ready will allow bacteria and debris to enter the pores, causing more pimples or painful infections.;
, Coating your pimple in aloe vera overnight can help soften dry, crusty zits, making them less painful and easier to remove the following morning.


Avoid any oil-based lotions and Vaseline, as these will clog up your pores and cause more issues.
 Clean the area around the pimple with a washcloth and soap. Use warm water to open up the pores and make the pimple easier to pop.


The best time to pop a pimple is often right after a hot shower, when the steam and heat has opened up your pores.
If you have to leave the needle or your hands get dirty, resterilize it before continuing. You need to do this to prevent infection.
 Your hands carry dirt and bacteria that will make your pimple worse if you do not protect it. Simply keeping a tissue between your fingers and the pimple should provide enough protection.


Most professionals use latex gloves to protect you from infection, so wear them if you have them.
 With your hands still covered, apply gentle pressure to the outside of the pimple to drain the pus. You do not want to cause pain, just drain the surface pus.


Do not use your bare fingers or nails, as this is an easy way to bring bacteria into the wound.
 Do not try to force out more pus if it does not come out with gentle pressure.
 Clean off the puss with a wet washcloth and apply topical anti-bacterial cream like Neosporin to prevent another infection.
 These can all be signs that a pimple is not ready to be popped. In some cases you can prolong the infection, leading to hard cysts that can only be removed by a dermatologist or plastic surgeon.
