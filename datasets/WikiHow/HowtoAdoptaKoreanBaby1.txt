 This needs to be done before you even identify a child for adoption, as the process of applying for an immigrant visa for your new baby can take some time. Doing so will also help to ensure that the baby you do eventually identify qualifies for a visa.;
, When adopting internationally, you will need to fill out one of two forms to start the process of acquiring a visa for your new baby. The Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption went into effect April of 2008, but many countries, including Korea, did not participate. To adopt from a non-Hague, fill out Form I-600A. To adopt from a Hague country, fill out form I-800A.
 Home studies consist of an in-person interview at the prospective parents' home, an evaluation of the physical and mental capabilities of the prospective parents, and a description of the parents' financial and living conditions, among other things. Each member of the household will also be checked for past criminal history.


Note that the USCIS will also run your fingerprint through an FBI background check to ensure a clean record devoid of criminal activity.
 You will need to send in a base filing fee of $720, and additional fees may also apply.
