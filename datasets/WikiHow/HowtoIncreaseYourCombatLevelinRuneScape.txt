 These are all level 1 and do not reduce your hit points! Pick up the bones and bury them for prayer experience. This is located north of Lumbridge Castle.


Alternately you could complete the Waterfall Quest and Fight Arena to get to level 44 instantly, however it is easy to die in these quests.;
, These are located north of Port Sarim and past the collapsed mine, east of Lumbridge. Pick up their cowhides and sell them at the Grand Exchange.
 any good drops, feel free to pick them up. These are located in Gunnar's Ground and in the Barbarian agility course.
 Due to a programming in when rs3 was released, these are level 146, yet only have 100 health. They will almost never hit, but give 452 experience for every kill, making these levels go by very quickly. These won't hurt you at all, but the zamorak warriors that are aggressive will hit quite accurately, so bring some food, These are located north-west of Relleka and will appear as rocks until you walk near them. An alternate method would be to stick to Dag'on hai monks until 65, as they give around the same exp per hour., These are located in the Taverly dungeon, and are aggressive. Once you hit 70 defence and attack, you may want to consider buying guthan's set, as it will allow you to stay at hellhounds indefinitely due to its healing factor., Along with their great charm drops for later in the guide, they are great experience along with drops. They drop two high level herbs at a time along with damaged chitin, which you can make into chitin scraps and sell for lots of profit., They drop lots of noted items, along with sharks to make your trips last longer. They also drop crimson charms 88% of the time, so picking them up will be well worth your while., Train Summoning and prayer.With the money you make from these creatures and the charms you picked up from kalphites and waterfiends, you should have enough to get 99 in summoning and prayer, maxing out your combat.
