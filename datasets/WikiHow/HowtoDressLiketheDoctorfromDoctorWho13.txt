wear black boots.

@summary
he sometimes wore a long sleeve black jumper with holes in it, over what seemed to be a white undershirt.

 He's the new boy on the block.
 Like Matt Smith, he has a frock coat. His is more of a black or navy blue coat.
 This is really a matter of opinion on what you want to use.
 The collar should be big, preferably narrow with no buttons on the collar points, and every button should be done.
 They also may just be suit pants.
 Dress boots may fit the bill (the official ones are black Doc Martens, yet again).
 He would also sometimes wear a plain black hoodie over it in cold weather (see "Last Christmas" for reference) with the hood over the coat., We have all twelve Doctors (and the debatable John Hurt/War Doctor). It's time for adventure and mystery. Now, "Shut up" - 12th doctor, multiple episodes, and have fun.
