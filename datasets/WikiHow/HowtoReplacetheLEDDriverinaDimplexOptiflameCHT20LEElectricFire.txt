,, Then remove the grate., Gently pull away the rubber connector from the motor, and then slide it out to the right., The bracket is held by 4 screws accessible from the back of the fire. Remove these screws using a cross-head screwdriver, and gently pull the bracket out. Gently remove the LED module from the bracket., Before disconnecting the wires, make a note of which colour of wire goes to which connector. The low voltage connectors are marked with a "+" and "-". This is very important, as the LEDs could be damaged if connected the wrong way round. Now disconnect the wires., If possible, buy a replacement module, type SLT12-350IF, but a retailer for these may be difficult to find. Otherwise, a suitable replacement is RACD12-350, made by Recom. This can be bought from RS Components, part number 7377067, and has the same electrical and physical specifications.
