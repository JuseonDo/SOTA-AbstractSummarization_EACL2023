 Most likely, four per chair if you are trying to calculate a large number of chairs.;
, You will need enough felt to cover each chair leg. Purchase pre-cut felt sheets or you can simply pull remnants from your felt bag for use.
 If you are working with an 81/2x11 pre-cut sheet, measure the felt into thirds (using your ruler and pencil). Follow the ruler with your pencil to create three distinct pieces.
 The cuts donâ€™t have to be perfect, but make sure you end up with three strip pieces.
 Center the felt piece so you have even overhang surrounding the bottom of the leg.
 Twist and tie band as many times as needed for the best fit.
 The felt bottoms should protect your floors until you can purchase a more attractive protection system.
