 Many websites allow you to adopt a manatee for a fee. You can name him/her, and usually you can visit your manatee any time you want.;
, This can be easier if you live in the southeast, like Florida, where manatees usually are.
 Over 500 manatees die every year, and they are expected to be extinct in 2020 if we don't do anything about it.
 to learn more about manatees.
 Have a lemonade stand, a garage sale, or do extra chores to get extra money.
 It seems kind of obvious, but there are other ways of littering when you don't even know it. Your trash could end up in the middle of the ocean (especially if you live in a beach town/city), and harm wildlife. Recycle, and never use plastic bags.
