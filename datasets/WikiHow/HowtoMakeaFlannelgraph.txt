 This will serve as your background. Choose a neutral color of flannel, such as pale blue. Glue the flannel on the back of cardboard. Do not use glue on front. Allow glue to dry and the background is basically finished. Set it on an easel.;
, Cut out the paper shapes, leaving a very large border around edge.
, Place shape, glue side down, onto flannel material. Repeat for each paper shape.
 Leave a thin border to outline the shape. Allow glue to dry and you are ready for an exciting class.
 The shapes stay where they are placed because of the fuzzy nap on both surfaces and the angle of the easel. They appear to be magnetic.
