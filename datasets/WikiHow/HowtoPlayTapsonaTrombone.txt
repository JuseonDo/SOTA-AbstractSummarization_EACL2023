Partials (also known as harmonics) are notes that are played in the same position. You change the position of your lips to achieve the different pitch. The first series of notes is in 1st position, the second is in 2nd, etc.;

Use an electric tuner to make sure that the trombone is in tune. If not you can adjust your tuning slide (pull out to go flat, push in to go sharp).
There are numerous free tuner applications for smartphones and tablets
