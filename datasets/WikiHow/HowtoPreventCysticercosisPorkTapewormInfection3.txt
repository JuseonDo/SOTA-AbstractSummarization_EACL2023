 Since the infection often does not produce any observable symptoms, it is important to get regular checkups. Try to see your physician at least once every six months.


You might exhibit symptoms anywhere from several weeks to 10 years after initial infection.
 There are a number of tests a doctor might run to determine if you have cysticercosis. You might, for instance, get a blood test to detect antibodies against the pork tapeworm. You might also get a biopsy, in which a needle is used to extract a small portion of your bodyâ€™s tissue and look for signs of tapeworms. Finally, you might have an imaging exam such as an X-ray, CT or MRI scan, or an ultrasound to get a better idea of where the cysts are., Steroids are also useful for preventing adverse effects brought on by other anti-tapeworm medications.
 Two common drugs are albendazole and praziquantel. Praziquantel is a medication designed specifically for treating flatworms and flukes. Albendazole is a more generalized medication useful for treating a variety of parasitic infections, but tends to be the preferred treatment method for cysticercosis.
 Talk to your doctor about alternative options before getting surgery to treat cysticercosis.
