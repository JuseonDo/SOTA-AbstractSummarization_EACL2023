if you don't have a mortar and pestle, try this neat trick.

@summary
consider bruising the basil before adding it to a blender or food processor.
@article
 Add the amount of basil required for a recipe and slowly grind it. This will produce a very flavourful basil.;
, Simply place the basil into a plastic zipper-lock bag. Then using a rolling pin or similar heavy kitchen utensil to pound the basil and bruise it.
 While you could simply add the basil to the machine, the speed of the cutting doesn't bring out the oils as well as slower bruising does. If you add the basil after it has been bruised, you'll get the benefit of its full flavour.
