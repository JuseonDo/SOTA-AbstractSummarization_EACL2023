 You'll need a vat and a good amount of bleach/water, depending on the size of the pumpkin.


The idea is that bleach is an antimicrobial, and that water will hydrate the skin of the pumpkin like a moisturizer would on human skin.
 Soak the pumpkin in the bleach solution for approximately 8 hours.
, Spray the outside and inside with the bleach solution used to treat the pumpkin initially. Soak up any excess moisture after spraying. Moisture is the ally of mold.
