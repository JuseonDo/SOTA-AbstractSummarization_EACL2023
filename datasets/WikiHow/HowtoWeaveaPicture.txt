Do this for each child making a picture. The children should not be cutting anything themselves.
 Cut it larger than the frame as it needs to be taped onto the back. Using masking tape or similar tape, stick the mesh down on the back of the frame so that it covers the front. It should sit flat and straight.
 Provide each child with the mesh frame. Tell them to make a picture of their own choosing by weaving the pieces in the craft box through and onto the mesh.

 Place their wonderful creation on display or help them to wrap it if they're giving it as a gift.
