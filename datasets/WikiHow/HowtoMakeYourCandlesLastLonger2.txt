 You can get beeswax, soy, or others.
 A lot of people say that soy last longer, but using customer reviews is helpful.
 Buy candles that say 24 hours or 7 days. Usually if the candle guarantees long life then you will get long candle life.
 But always do this safely and never handle dangerous chemicals that you are not equipped to use.
