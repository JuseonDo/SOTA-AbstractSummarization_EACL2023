 It's the black, apple-shaped icon in the upper-left of your screen.;
,, It's near the top right of the Preferences window.
 It appears at the top of the left pane of the dialog box.



You can schedule times when Do Not Disturb is automatic, such as during night hours. In addition, you can activate Do Not Disturb when the display is sleeping or mirroring on a TV or projector. This prevents others from publicly seeing notifications on your Mac.
When Do Not Disturb is activated during a scheduled time, a "Do Not Disturb" slider will appear at the top of the Notification Center. When activated, you can use this slider to toggle Do Not Disturb on and off.
When Do Not Disturb is activated, you can also choose to allow calls from everyone and allow repeated calls, if you prefer.
 This is the icon in the menu bar at the top-right corner of your Mac's screen.
 Doing so will reveal the Do Not Disturb Slider.
 This will turn Do Not Disturb on as specified by the preferences you set in System Preferences.
