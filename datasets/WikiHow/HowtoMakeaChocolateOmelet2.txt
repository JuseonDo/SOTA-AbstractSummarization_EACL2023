 Whisk to combine.
 Whisk in to completely combine. It should be frothy when done.
 You can add a teaspoon of butter or oil if wished but this isn't needed. Preferably, use a non-stick pan.
 Cook the first side until it's almost done.
 Turn the heat down to low or even off (if electric). Sprinkle the chocolate chips across the omelet, then fold the omelet over. These will melt in.


Add sliced bananas or strawberries to the center, if wished.
 Sprinkle with a few more chocolate chips to complete the omelet. Add more fruit for serving with, as wished.
