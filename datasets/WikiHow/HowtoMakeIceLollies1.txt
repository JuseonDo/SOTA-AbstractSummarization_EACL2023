 Stir or whisk to make sure the syrup is evenly mixed with the orange juice. Consider using fresh-squeezed juice that you can find a many grocery stores, which will be less watered down and have more flavor.


For a little extra kick, add 2 tbsp lemon juice to the mixture.Feel free to experiment with any kind of fruit juice you like! Grape, pineapple, watermelon, limeaide--it's up to you!
You may even want to try adding some veggie juice--carrot juice is naturally very sweet and can add a nice complexity to your lollies.;
, Fill each cell almost to the top, but don't overflow or your lollies will stick together.
 Make sure the wrap is tight across the top of the tray.Tape plastic wrap to the sides of the ice tray to keep it tight and in place.
 This will be the handle for your ice lolly--make sure it is standing up straight and is far enough into the tray for the juice to freeze around it., To be certain your lollies are totally frozen, leave them in overnight.If you just can't wait, check after 2-3 hours.


You can gently wiggle one toothpick to feel if the juice has frozen completely.
 Your mini-ice lollies should be ready to eat.
 Be gentle while working the ice cube tray--you don't want to snap it!


If you have trouble getting the cubes out, try dipping the bottom of the tray in warm water.
