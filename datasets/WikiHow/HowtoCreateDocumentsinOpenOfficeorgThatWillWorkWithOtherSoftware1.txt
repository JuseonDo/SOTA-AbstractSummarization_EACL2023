, Base is another useful one that makes databases, but it is rather difficult to get it to work with MS Access.
, For Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works; Word uses .doc, Excel uses .xls and Powerpoint uses .ppt. Google Office uses Open Document Format.

 PDF is an open device-independent fixed-layout document format. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a 2-D document that includes the text, fonts, images, and 2-D vector graphics that compose the document.
