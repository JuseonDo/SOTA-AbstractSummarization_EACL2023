 This is important because although you are using the shell for a "basket," the inside of the fruit will still be eaten. If the fruit inside of the watermelon is over-ripe, it may be difficult to work with. But, if the fruit is under-ripe, your salad will be bland and flavorless.

If you have any doubts regarding the freshness of a fruit, ask the produce manager at your local supermarket about how to select for ripeness.;

These lines will help guide you as you cut a handle into the watermelon.
 Reserve the cut-off watermelon chunks.

After cutting out the handle, make the handle appear wavy by slowly cutting out semicircles from the skin.
 Put about half of the melon balls into one bowl. You will be filling the basket with them later.

The other half of the melon can be stored or eaten right awayâ€”it won't be needed for the fruit salad.
, Mix the cantaloupe and honeydew with the leftover half of the watermelon, adding the pineapple and grapes. Blend well.
