 When first entering the Pitt, ask Werhner for a concealed pistol. There is also an AK-47 lost in the Steelyard and a baseball bat in a slave stash.;
, You probably only have slave rags, so repair it with garments of dead slaves. There are several located in the Steelyard. Once you collect 10 ingots and return them to the Steelyard manager, he may give you better armor as a reward.
 Sleep to get full health before going to Ashur's announcement.
 Talk to the organizer. She will let you pick an extra weapon from the locker.
 Stay back as far as you can; the radiation affects you immediately.
 Quickly locate the slave with the combat shotgun. This slave will do the most damage to you; the others carry varying pistols.
 Then proceed to kill the others. Be sure to pick up and repair weapons and armor.
 Take meds for the radiation, then drink from the water fountain to get full health.
 Using any guns you have, kill the Bear brother with the flamethrower. Make sure to keep moving to avoid the Bear brother with the Deathclaw gauntlet.
 Rest up, and prepare yourself.
 Again, use a gun.
 Aim for the weapon and fire.
