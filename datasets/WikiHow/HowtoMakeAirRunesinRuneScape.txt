 If purchasing you can easily buy from the Grand Exchange, if mining choose a mining spot close to an air altar (click locate on your air tiara/talisman to find the location of your nearest air altar).;
, When you finish the Rune Mysteries Quest, you will receive an air talisman as a reward, or you can purchase an air talisman or tiara at the Grand Exchange. The advantage of using an air tiara is that you can wear it on your head instead of holding it and so you save an extra space in your inventory, allowing you to Runecraft more runes per trip.
 The talisman will tell you in which direction to walk to get to the Altar.
 Then click on the ruins. Doing this will teleport you inside to the Altar. When you're inside, walk towards the middle to find the Altar. When you find the Altar, click on it to convert all the essence in your inventory into runes. When you're done, find the exit portal and enter it. You'll be teleported back outside.
