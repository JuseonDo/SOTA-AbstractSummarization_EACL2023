 First, draw a circle as a base of the head. Then,draw an egg-shaped circle to show the guidelines for drawing the actual shape of the head.;
, Draw four horizontal lines and a vertical line. These are the guides for you to draw the brows, eyes, nose and lips.
 Notice that there are six slanted lines sketched on the feature outlines. These slanted lines are more detailed guidelines for you to know where the exact positions of the features will be drawn. The ears’ guidelines are connected to the line to eyebrows, line to the eyes and line to nose.
, Normally, people draw necks that are just enough to carry the head but drawing Son Goku’s design is quite different because most of the male anime character designs were drawn with a slender and tall appearance. Since he is, apparently, the strongest anime protagonist of all times, he possesses a muscular body that emphasizes his strength.
, Start sketching Goku’s unique hairstyle by drawing curves of largely spiked hair.
, Make sure that you show his thick eyebrows. Most male anime characters have thick eyebrows simply to show that they are the male characters and to show more of their facial expressions.
,,,, One of Goku’s signature design is his muscular body, so try to get used to drawing his bulky muscles.
,,,, Let’s assume that the light source is from the right area of the image. That means that the shades and shadows should be shown at the areas on the left part of the character design.
