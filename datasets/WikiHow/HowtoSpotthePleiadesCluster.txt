@summary
know where to look, approximately.

@summary
if the moon is not visible, (by this if it is below the horizon), but orion is, the cluster is probably east of orion.

@summary
make sure all nearby light sources are off.

@summary
look directly at between orion and the moon.

@summary
if you wear glasses for distance vision correction, put them on.

@summary
squint if you have to, but you should eventually be able to see a faint blue light, not a single star, in the sky.try using a telescope or some binoculars for a better view.

@summary
congrats.

 The cluster itself is actually very bright, but is far away from Earth, and therefore, difficult to spot with the naked eye. First thing, know where to look in the sky. The cluster is generally somewhere between the moon and the Orion constellation. Locate the moon, (shouldn't be too hard), and then locate Orion.;
, If the moon is visible but Orion is not, look to the west of the moon.
 If there is any light pollution at all then the cluster will be extremely difficult to find.
 You should be looking high into the sky.
, If you look closer, you can even make out the individual stars, an may even notice the dipper shaped pattern they make.
, You have just spotted the Pleiades star cluster.
