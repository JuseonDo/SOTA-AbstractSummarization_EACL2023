if you know of a place where blackbirds are at, and you want to hunt them, there's only one option.

 Stalking. Blackbirds have good eyesight, so you should wear camouflage. Walk slowly, making sure not to step on dry leafs or twigs. Try to keep something in between you and the birds as you stalk towards them. When you're close enough, slowly ready your weapon, and take the shot.
