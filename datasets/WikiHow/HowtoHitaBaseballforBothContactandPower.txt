watch.

@summary
some hitters will commonly drop their hands, meaning that instead of going in a diagonal path to the ball with your hands and bat like you should, the hitter will let his hands drop and swing in a straight line, resulting in either a swing and miss or a pop-up.

@summary
as you swing, your head may naturally turn away before the point of contact, ready to see where the ball went.

@summary
if you have followed all of these directions, you have probably made good contact with the ball on the sweet spot of the bat and you are now in a great position to do some damage to the other team.

@summary
as you end your swing, make sure you don't feel like your back foot has to move immediately.

 Make sure you have most of your weight on your back foot, Â As the pitch comes in, get ready to hit by "loading up", or stepping with your front foot (left foot if you're a right-handed batter, right foot if you're a left-handed batter) straight towards the pitching mound. A common mistake hitters will make is that they will "step out", or step behind them. This leads to either totally missing the ball or barely making contact.;
, The pitch is now coming towards the plate - time to make a decision. The strike zone is the length of the front of home plate and from the batter's shoulders to his or her knees. If the ball seems like it won't pass through that area, take the pitch; even if it ends up a strike, you have two more strikes before you're called out.


If the ball is probably going to be a strike, follow it with your eyes and turn your head to see it fully as it comes closer to home plate, not taking your eyes off of it.
 With your bat, practice going diagonally to the ball until you have it perfect.
 That would be great, except you haven't hit the ball yet. It is imperative that you make a conscious effort as you go to hit the ball that you keep your head looking at the ball. Bringing your head out results in foul tips/swings and misses.
 As you swing, make sure to continue just as fast as you were going when you went to hit the ball even after you have felt contact. Keep your hands steady and level the whole way through, and end with them above your front shoulder. Your hips should naturally have made a quick, powerful twist that has transferred the power of your swing to the ball.
 If you do, it means you're probably off-balance and thus your swing won't have much power to it. The way to fix balance in your swing is to become more familiar with it and even adjust if necessary.
 If all steps were followed, you've probably driven the ball a long way and you can start running to first base. Good luck.
