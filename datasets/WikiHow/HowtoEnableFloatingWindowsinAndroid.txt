 First you’ve have to get the Framework installer, which you can find in the Xposed Module Repository site (http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer).;
, Before you can install the Framework, you have to make sure that “Unknown Sources” is checked in Settings > Security > Device Administration. This enables installing third-party application not found in the Google Play store. Then you can directly install the .apk file if you downloaded it onto your device.


If you got the file from your PC or Mac, you’ll have to transfer it somewhere to your phone memory or SD card, then install it. It should look like the typical Android application installation procedure.
 Locate the app icon and press it. Once it has loaded, go to Framework. Here you can install or update the Framework in case yours is outdated.


Once that is done, reboot your device.
There is a "Soft Reboot" button at the bottom of the screen, which will reboot that device more quickly.
 Please refer to the next part.,, Tap it when you find the button.
 This is optional. Once you’ve finished reading, tap "Download."

,,,,,

,, Some of these require a reboot.


Don’t worry, notifications will appear when reboot is required.
Enjoy your new floating window–enabled Android device!
