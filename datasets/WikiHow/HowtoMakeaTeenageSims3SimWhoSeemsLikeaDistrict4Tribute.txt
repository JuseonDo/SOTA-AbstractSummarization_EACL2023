, District 4 tributes tend to be Career Tributes, and thus would be very strong and athletic. For the same reason, if you have Pets installed, adjust the muscle size to make your tribute a bit over muscled.


If your tribute is female and you have Pets installed, make her rather under endowed. You want her to look as fit and athletic as possible, as odds are she would be a Career Tribute.
, Remember, District 4 is the fishing district! Wavy hair is also a good idea for this Sim. Do not use an elaborate hairstyle, as this would be more District 1 than District 4.
 It is imperative that your tribute has green eyes!

,, Nothing he or she wears should be in neon colors, with the possible exception of bright, crystal blue for the ocean (remember, this is the fishing district). For athletic wear, you may use the above colors or camouflage colors (for the Hunger Games arena). Make the swimsuit an aquatic color. For sleepwear, regardless of the tribute's gender, use pajamas rather than a nightgown - District 4 tributes, being Career Tributes, would have clothing that is easy to move around in.
 (The last three are because District 4 tributes tend to be Career Tributes.)

,, Refer to Be a Water Princess for ideas.
 You might have to use the "motherlode" cheat several times for this.
 District 4 tributes, being Career Tributes, tend to throw artistic and musical pursuits to the wind in favor of fishing and athletic pursuits.
 This helps with the "ocean" theme.
 If you have Pets installed, another thing you can add is a turtle terrarium.
