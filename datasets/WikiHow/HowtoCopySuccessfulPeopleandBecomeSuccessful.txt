 The best way to become successful is to be in the proximity of success on a daily basis. This may seem pretentious, but the reality is that successful people lead the kind of life that you want to be a part of, so it is essential that you too be surrounded in such a lifestyle.;
, Additionally, you will come to identify the cause and effect of certain actions. This is a major learning tool if you want to be successful yourself one day.
 Successful people have a certain way of doing things and if you copy these habits, they will become ingrained in you and eventually become second nature. For example, talking a certain way or interacting with other people can be habits that lead to certain successes.
 By doing so, you will recognize a similarity between you and the successful, thus making your own success feel more plausible in your own eyes.
 Success is often followed by numerous occasions of failure, so find out the bad and the good behind each success story. With such knowledge, you will be less likely to get depressed if you yourself fail on occasion, and you may even be able to avoid certain pitfalls by seeing them foreshadowed in the stories of others.
 Such arrogance can easily cloud your ability to remain ahead of the game. A successful person is always learning from their mentors. When you feel you have gained as much knowledge from your circle of successful people, expand your social network by inviting even more success into it.
