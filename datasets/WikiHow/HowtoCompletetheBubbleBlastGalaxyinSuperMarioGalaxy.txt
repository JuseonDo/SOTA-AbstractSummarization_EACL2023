If you have done so, then you can take the green launch star over by the garage.;
, You will proceed to the Mission Selection Screen.
 You'll be in a planet where there are lots of wires in a shape. Your spawn point will be on the star planet. Go through the pipes and collect star chips for each of the five pipes.


Be extra careful. If you run into a wire or get hit by a hazard. You will certainly die. This imitates like a Daredevil Comet.
 Take the star and you will travel to the next advanced planet.


This second planet will be your checkpoint.
 Press A to move the bubble around.


Please avoid bullet bills, wires, or any hazard.
