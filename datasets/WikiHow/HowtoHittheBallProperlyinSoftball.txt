,, If you can't touch the edge of the plate farthest away from you, adjust yourself so you can.
 Stiff legs require you to tighten your muscles, which will reduce the power of your swing.
 Your "knocking knuckles" (your middle knuckles that bend the middle of your fingers) should line-up. This means that your left hand's knocking knuckles should be in line with your right hand's knocking knuckles. This position will help you snap through your swing, which will add power to your swing.
 This is called the "rest" position. You will hold this position until the pitcher starts his/her pitch during a real game.
 If you have completed this step correct, then you should be able to stick your back hand's thumb out and touch your ear.
 This will ensure that your swing will ONLY GO FORWARD. This is a positive swing. Unlike in baseball, you do not want to pull your bat back for power. That is a negative swing. The pitcher in softball is closer than a baseball pitcher, so negative motion will only work in baseball.
 This is the whole concept of positive motion.
 When you make contact with the ball, roll your wrists overs and extend your wrists out toward the outfield.
 Turn your hips toward the pitcher.
 Do not stop putting your strength into your swing when you contact the ball. This is a common mistake, and it will reduce the power of your swing. Pull your back arm and tuck it underneath your shoulder.
