, Place them in the oven for about 30 minutes until they reach 110째F (43째C) at their center. Use a good meat thermometer for this part.









Make sure they don't get hotter than this! Otherwise they'll start cooking. And note that timing will vary depending on the thickness of your steaks.
 Time this so while the oil is heating, you can take the steaks out. Pat them dry with a paper towel and set them aside. The oil is ready when it starts to smoke.
 This should take about 60 to 90 seconds per side. Take the steaks off the heat and let them rest for about 5 minutes before you serve them.









They should only be slightly less juicy than their once-cooked counterparts and their crusts should actually be more crispy -- always a good thing. This may take more time than zapping in the microwave, but it's worth it.
