 Called Tapsilog because it is a mixture of three foods, Tapa (beef), Sinangag (fried rice), and Itlog (fired egg), this is a classic Filipino breakfast.
 You want to add the egg when you only have 2-3 minutes left for the beef to cook. Cook one egg for every person eating.
 You want to rice to be slightly undercooked.
 You want enough oil to coat the rice.
 Cook it for 3-4 minutes, or until the onions are slightly see-through.
 You want the rice to be coated in the oil.
 Add any salt and pepper to taste and stir the rice regularly to prevent burning.
 If you have limited cooking space it is usually easiest to cook the rice ahead of time and reheat it before you eat.


To reheat rice, put a drip of oil and 2-3 tablespoons of water in a skillet and cook the rice on low, covered, for 4-5 minutes. Stir regularly.
 Vinegar dipping sauce is simple to make if you have the ingredients. Simply mix the following in a bowl:


1 1/2 cup White Vinegar
1 medium Onion, chopped
4 cloves Garlic, chopped
2 tablespoon Soy Sauce
1 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon Sugar
1/4 teaspoon Ground Pepper
