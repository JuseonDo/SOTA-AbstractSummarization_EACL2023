 To do this, cut the mango down either side of the stone with a sharp knife. Remove the cheek of flesh and cut criss-cross in the flesh of each cheek to reveal cubes. Using both hands, turn the mango peel inside out, which will pop out the cubes separately, still attached to the peel.;

 Alternatively, you can barbecue them if preferred.
