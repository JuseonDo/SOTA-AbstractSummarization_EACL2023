once your zoo has at least a few animals in it, tell your friends about it!

 Remember, if the animal center is at your home, then it is not a good idea to post about it on the internet. Home zoos are not something everyone worldwide should come to visit. However, if you would like visitors, put posters up in covered places in your neighborhood.
