@summary
as with most gymnastics skills, the most important thing for learning a new motion is practice.

@summary
you may find it helpful to have a friend act as a spotter, or someone who will help you walk across the beam.

@summary
start by practicing on a line on the ground or a low beam (one that is only a few inches off the ground).

@summary
place one foot in front of the other.

@summary
extend your arms straight out to the side, like the wings on an airplane.

@summary
stay "tight.",

@summary
as you become more comfortable with the beam and your muscles learn the movements, practice on higher beams.

 It may take many tries before you can consistently walk across the balance beam without falling. That's okay; gymnastics is a difficult sport.;
, He or she should stand on the ground while you are on the beam. They should place their hands on your waist or lower rib cage - not on your arms or legs - to help you keep your balance. Note: you should always have some sort of supervision (see Warnings).
 A good rule of thumb is to start at a height where you feel comfortable, and work your way up.
 People with small feet may be able to walk with their feet completely or partially next to each other, but it is better to practice putting one foot in front of the other. In addition to being good practice for more complicated moves, this reduces the likelihood that your feet will get tangled up or that you will trip.
 You might feel a little silly, but you will be able to balance much more easily.
 This means that you should be squeezing your muscles, but not so much that you cannot move. If nothing else, you should make an effort to keep your core (abdominal muscles) tight. If you are "loose," or your muscles are not tight, you will find you lose your balance much more often.
 Before you know it, you'll be able to walk across a beam like an Olympian!
