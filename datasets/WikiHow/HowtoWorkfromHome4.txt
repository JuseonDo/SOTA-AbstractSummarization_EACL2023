 Make a point of getting out of your house during non-work hours. Don’t spend your entire day — working and not working — at home. Eventually, you will get sick of simply being in your home. Get out periodically. Go to restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, sporting events, local concerts, and anything else that takes place outside your home.


Even consider working from a different location. Work at a family member's home. Work at a coffee shop with minimal distractions. Work at the park., Join a gym. Exercise is important for your physical and mental health. Sitting at your work area for hours a day will eventually lead to fatigue, lack of motivation, and disinterest.Studies show that brief workouts in the middle of a work day actually raise productivity. Researchers argue that dopamine releases during workouts, which carry on for a period following a workout, giving your muscles a chance to recuperate. This dopamine puts you in a better mood overall., Yes, you are working from home, but you are entitled to a break.


Walk away from your computer a couple of times during your work day – stroll around the garden, take a walk around the block, whatever feels most relaxing to you. Some fresh air will do you a world of good and refresh your mind. If possible, avoid watching TV or getting sucked into a hobby as this is a very easy way to lose track of time.
