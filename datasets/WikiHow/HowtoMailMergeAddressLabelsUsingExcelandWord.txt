Save the file. Remember the location and name of the file.
Close Excel.



If the Task Pane is not open on the right side of the screen, go to View/Task Pane and click on it. The Task Pane should appear.
, Click OK once you have chosen.
, Open this file and a dialog box will open. All recipients should be selected by default. If not, do so and click OK.
, Click on them in the order they will appear on the label. This is normally First Name, Last Name, Street Address, City, county, Postal code. Ignore the fact that they all end up on a single line, when you're done selecting you can add spaces and carriage returns where you want them on the label. When you have all fields inserted click OK. If you forget one place the cursor where you want it to go (the field to the right of the cursor will probably turn grayâ€”that's OK), then click on "More items..." again and choose the field you want to add. Click CLOSE on the window once you have finished inserting all the fields you require.
 Ignore it when the field after the location for either one turns grey the space will be added instead of replacing the field.
 This depends on the size of the label you are using, but looks better!


If everything is where you want it click on Update All Labels. You should see the fields copied to all labels.
, At this screen you can edit individual labels or print. it is worth clicking on EDIT INDIVIDUAL LABELS and clicking ALL and OK even if you are happy with it so that you can access all the pages of labels.


Save the file before you do anything else!

, The advantage is that they can be easier and quicker to use.
