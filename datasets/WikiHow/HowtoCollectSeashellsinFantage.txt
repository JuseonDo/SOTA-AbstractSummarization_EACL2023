, Those are the Seashell costumes. There is one for premium members and one for non members. Click the buy button under which costume is suitable for you.
 Click the clothes section and then click the costumes section to put your costume on.
 There are only 3 seashells non members can collect, while premium members can collect all of them. The picture above shows which shells non members can collect.
 Every time you collect a shell (that you can collect) your shell collection will pop up, telling you which shells you have and which shells you still need to get an item.
 There will be a row for the item and shells you needed. If the combine button is blue, that means you are ready to get the item.
 Just follow those instructions and when your done, click done under step 3.
 You have received your prize!
