@article
 All of the models in them are airbrushed and they don't really look like they are portrayed. If we were all Photoshopped we would all look like them. Magazines actually won't accept a cover that has not been airbrushed.;
, When you are maturing, you are going through a growth process to accept yourself, and this takes time. Try to only think the positives about you and forget the negatives.
 Keep a journal and write out your best qualities, such as kindness, mercy to others, and strength. Read this when you feel down.
 Don't look in the mirror and say something negative about yourself. Put a post-it note on your bathroom mirror that says "good morning, beautiful!", or an inspirational quote.
 Forget the insults. People only give insults because they need to put other people down to feel superior.
 A label or the size on a pair of jeans does not make you a better or worse person.
 (It helps when you hear someone else encourage you. ) Then turn around and compliment your friend.
 Avoid depending on internet relationships, which can be very shallow.
 If someone says "You are fat" or something along those lines, either keep your chin up and ignore them or face them and respond by telling them that they don't have to make immature comments to feel better about themselves. In fact, point them to this article!

, If you want to change your body by being skinnier, exercise and eat in moderation, but don't fall prey to anorexia, bulimia, or another eating disorder. If you are trying to make yourself look prettier, this is no way to do it. You are accepted and loved just the way you are, not trying to be something you are not.
 Give yourself a manicure or just relax in your room and have time to yourself. Read or do something YOU want.
 If you perform acts of kindness and go out of your way to Help People, you will become much happier.
