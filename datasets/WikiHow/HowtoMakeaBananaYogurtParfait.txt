 If you love oats and think that it should be the highlight of your parfait, you can definitely take more.;
, If you prefer honey, use that but the original recipe does call for maple syrup.Â This step is optional; if you aren't a fan of any kind of syrup, you don't need to add any.
, Cook the oats and maple syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. This should definitely add more crunch and sweetness to the oats. After it's done cooking, set that aside.
 It really doesn't matter how you cut up the banana but thin slices are standard.
 One of the best parts of making a parfait is that you can get creative with the types of yogurt. A great way to make a parfait healthy is by using Greek yogurt. For this parfait, vanilla flavored yogurt is nice. Other favorites that would be suitable include blueberry and strawberry yogurts, which will complement the banana flavor nicely.
 Nuts that go really well with this parfait include walnuts, almonds, and cashews. If you don't like nuts, leave them out.
 Keep in mind, they tend to have added sugar though.
 Parfaits are usually layered, which works better when added to a tall glass rather than a bowl.
 Flatten it slightly, so that it's easier to layer the things on top.
,,, When you reach the top, add any extra toppings that you picked out earlier. You can also add a drizzle of maple syrup of honey at the top if you want.
 Some people like to refrigerate the parfait for about ten minutes, so that it's cold and refreshing when they eat it. It's up to you how long you wish to wait before serving it.
