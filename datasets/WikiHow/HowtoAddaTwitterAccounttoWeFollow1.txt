@summary
post from rom your twitter account as you normally would, but address the post to wefollow with the list of no more than 3 categories you wish to be listed under.
@article



For example if the wikiHow account wanted to add itself in the 3 categories of "HowTo, DIY, and wiki", we would use the following post on Twitter:






@wefollow #howto #DIY #wiki


Confirm that you now appear on the directories you signed up for by doing a search for the tag / categories you submitted on. An example category from the wikiHow example is here: http://wefollow.com/interest/diy
