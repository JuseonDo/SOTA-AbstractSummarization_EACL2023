 It will be melted, so the smaller the pieces, the better, but don't be fussy about the shape or size.;
, Using your fingers, break up the fruit cake slices or chunks into a mixing bowl.
 Place the bowl in a pan of simmering water. Allow the ingredients to melt together.
, Add the rum or rum extract. Stir it all together.
 Cover to keep odors out. The mixture is ready to turn into truffles when it feels firm to touch.
 Dig out a heaped teaspoon of the mixture to form the first truffle.
 Roll in the coating of choice.


Sprinkle the coating across a saucer before rolling the balls.

For serving: Line a plate or tray with foil and arrange as wished. Keep refrigerated until serving time, to firm them completely.
For gift: Line a box or container with wax paper, baking paper or foil. Arrange the truffles in one layer. If adding another layer, place another layer of paper/foil to prevent sticking. Stop after two layers or the top truffles will squash the ones beneath. Keep refrigerated until it's time to give them.
