 There are countless sites that have fonts available to download, but you should try to download from reputable sources to avoid malware and viruses. A few of the more popular font sites include:


dafont.com
fontspace.com
fontsquirrel.com.;
, You can download fonts from a variety of different websites online. Windows supports the TTF and OTF formats for fonts.


Do not download any font that comes in EXE format or requires an installer to use. These are most likely vehicles for malware and other unwanted programs.
 Some fonts will download as a ZIP or RAR file, usually when multiple fonts are included in a single package. You'll need to extract the fonts from the ZIP or RAR file before installing them.


To open a ZIP file, simply double-click it and then drag the font files onto your desktop.
To open a RAR file, you'll first need to install a free extraction program like 7-Zip (7-zip.org) or WinRAR (rarlabs.com. After installing the program, you'll be able to double-click the archive file and then drag the font files to your desktop.
 The Control Panel will allow you to install new fonts. The font installation process is the same for all versions of Windows.


Windows 7 and older - Click the Start menu and select "Control Panel."
Windows 8 - Press âŠž Win+X and select "Control Panel."
Windows 8.1 and 10 - Right-click on the Start button and select "Control Panel."

, This will allow you to easily find the Fonts option.
 Select the Fonts option in the Control Panel to open the Fonts window. This will display all of the fonts currently installed on your computer.
 Make sure you drag the OTF or TTF file, not the ZIP file that they came in. OTF and TTF files should have a font icon.
 Installing fonts requires administrator access. If you're the only user of your computer, you likely won't be prompted.
 Once you've installed a font, you'll be able to select it in any program that allows you to choose from Windows fonts.
