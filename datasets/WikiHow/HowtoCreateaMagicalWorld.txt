 Plan out the geography and topography (the arrangement of physical and natural features), and think about the climate. You could also draw maps and pictures.;
, Don't plagiarize (taking someone else's name), though! This should express the wonder and imagination you want that world to have. For example, a world filled with demons, a bad government, antagonists (people that want to destroy the world) etc should not be called Bliss - a name more suited to a peaceful place.
 It's no use if you can't get in! Make sure that it is a secret entrance: this world isn't for just anybody. Some examples include; saying magical words before entering; crossing a bridge / rope over a river (like in the film 'Bridge to Terabithia') or a more magical transportation - you could arrange items in a particular way and use them as a teleportation board.
 Begin decorating your fresh canvas. Create of plants, weather, buildings, cliffs, etc. Make the world very detailed but only as realistic as you want.
 Use your imagination! What is their personality like? How about their appearance and origin?

, Protagonists (good people) and antagonists (the opposite) make for a great, action-filled plot line.
 You can sharpen a sturdy stick. How will you fight your enemy? Or are you the bad guy! Create an impenetrable fortress. Or, make a fortress which has only one weakness!

,,, Kings, Queens, Dwarfs?

, Create a story and a history! Make it interesting!

, This is a great opportunity to learn how to lucid dream!
