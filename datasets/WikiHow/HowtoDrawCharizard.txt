Firstly, look at a picture of a charizard and see how the eyes are being drawn. Now, draw the eyes. It doesn't have to look the same but, close enough. Loosen your hand before drawing the eyes of the character.



Look how the mouth of the character looks like in different angles before drawing.
,


While drawing the wings, make sure that the height and width of the right wing is equal to that of the left wing. If you're making a 3D look it doesn't matter but, normally wings of different length won't look good.
,,,


Make sure that you add the little details to the body that makes a huge difference. Observe the character and then draw. These little details if forgotten can spoil your drawing.
,,,,,, Tidy up a little bit and make sure not to tear your paper by erasing it hard.
Paint your character if you want to.
Good job. Your sketch is now ready!

, Make the top triangle slightly smaller than the bottom one.
 However, instead of drawing a triangle on bottom, draw an oval. Also add a vertical line on the right side.
 Also add a parallelogram on the left side of the drawing, and various small shapes to create legs.
 Give shape to the head and wings as shown.
 Add facial features.
