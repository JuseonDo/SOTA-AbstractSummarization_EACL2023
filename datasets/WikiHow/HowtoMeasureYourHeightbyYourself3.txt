Consider this method if you need to find your height right away and don’t have time to get a ruler.
Be aware that this will be an approximate measurement.
 Making a ruler by measuring a dollar bill is easy because all bills in the United States are 6 inches long (½ feet).Lay the bill next to the string. Lay the bill and ruler flat with your hand.
Mark the end of the bill on the string with a marker and repeat until you reach 6 feet.
Use another bill if you don’t have a dollar bill.
 Attach the string to the wall using tape.


Be sure not to break the string.
Stand up straight with your feet and back against the wall.
Mark the top of your head on the string.
Look at the string to find your height.
