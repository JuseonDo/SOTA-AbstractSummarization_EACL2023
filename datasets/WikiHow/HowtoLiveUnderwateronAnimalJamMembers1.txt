 This is most fun with a lost ruins den because there is more decorating room. But if you long for a sunken ship get it.;
, Make sure to have all water animals, and only one water/land animal. If you are staying temporarily, don't delete all your animals.
 Wear the clothes. And get some fun ocean portals too.
 If you get to their land den, switch the portal's programming. If you can't get to an underwater program, just ask a friend to buy one!
