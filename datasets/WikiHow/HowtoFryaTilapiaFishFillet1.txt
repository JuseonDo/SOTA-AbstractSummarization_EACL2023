 This, of course, is after you've rinsed it under cold water.;
, Mix it up thoroughly to distribute the flavors. If you have more than one fillet, adjust the recipe as necessary.
 Once it's adequately covered, shake off any excess.
 You may use other oils, but olive oil is tasty and one of the healthier oils.
 Pan fry for two minutes on each side or until cooked through.
 It'll be ready by the time you grab plates and silverware.
