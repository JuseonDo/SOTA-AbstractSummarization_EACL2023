 This includes fires, matches, candles and cigarettes. Teach children not to play with matches or lighters and to bring them to adults straight away if they find them.;
, If an open cooking fire is used, it should be made on a raised mound of clay, not directly on the ground.
 a curious or energetic child can easily knock over a cooking pot. Do not leave hot dishes on the edge of tables either.
 The steam from boiling kettles or steaming pots is dangerously hot and can burn or scald easily.
 Objects made of glass and metal can become very hot sitting next to a fire source. Take care to move any objects away before cooking or lighting a fire.
 Such things to be careful with include petrol, paraffin, lamps, matches, candles, lighters, hot irons and electric cords.
 Children can be seriously injured if they put their fingers or other objects into electric sockets. Power sockets should be covered to prevent access.
 Electric wires should be kept out of children's reach. Bare electric wires are particularly dangerous.
 If you cannot be sure that your child will not stay away from a fire or heat source, consider ways to create a barrier, such as a grill around a fire or a safety gate to keep a child out of the cooking area etc.
 Don't let a child sit on your lap while you are drinking a hot drink. One bump can result in terrible scalds.
 Make sure that children understand the consequences of getting too close to flame or heat. Tell older children and encourage them to explain this to their younger siblings and other younger children.
