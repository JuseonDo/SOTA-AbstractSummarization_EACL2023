 The last thing you want to do is constantly have to get up from your desk to retrieve supplies, so look for a shelf or area that is near your work space.
 You may want to just clamp the strip first and see how it looks or how you will use it before adding screws and making it a permanent fixture.
 The magnetic strip package will most likely include screws and instructions on the best way mount it.
