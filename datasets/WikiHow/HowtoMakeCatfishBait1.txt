 (2.25 kg) of overly ripe cheese. Many anglers recommend orange-colored cheese, such as American or cheddar.;
,, Mash the cheese until a paste forms.
 (1 to 1.3 kg) of raw chicken livers and blood in a blender. Anglers suggest buying chicken livers in a small tub because this type of package includes the most blood. Blood attracts catfish and it is an important ingredient in many bait recipes.
 Mix thoroughly.



Remove as much air as possible before closing the lid by depressing the sides of the container. As the mixture ferments, it will create gases, and removing the air from the bucket will keep it from exploding.
