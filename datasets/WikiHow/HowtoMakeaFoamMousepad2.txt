 You can make it larger or smaller if preferred, although the standard size will be around 8.5" x 8".


Use the ruler and pencil to measure and mark before cutting.
 Cut the oilcloth to the same size.
 Lay down a protective cover before spraying.
, Take care to smooth it out and remove any wrinkles as quickly as possible.
 Hold the edge of a teacup or similar curved object in the exact same position around all four corners, then snip around this to form the curved edges. Or, do it freehand if you trust your skills.


Alternatively, use pinking shears and cut an interesting edging around the entirety of the mousepad, or just down the side edges.
 The mousepad is now ready for regular use.
