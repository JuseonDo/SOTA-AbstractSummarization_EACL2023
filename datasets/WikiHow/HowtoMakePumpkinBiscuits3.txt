 Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. You can also use a non-stick baking sheet. Set the baking sheet aside.
 Stir them briskly together until they are evenly combined. For a hint of flavor, you can also add up to 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.
 Don't over-mix; if you do, your biscuits may not be as fluffy. Make sure that the coconut oil is solid. If it is too liquidy, leave it in the fridge until it turns solid, at least 30 minutes., If you are using canned pumpkin, make sure that you are using the plain kind and not the "pumpkin pie" kind. The pumpkin pie kind has additional ingredients which may affect the recipe. Also, try to use the coconut milk that comes in a carton as opposed to a can; it's lighter.
 The dough should start to leave the sides of the bowl. Again, be careful not to over-mix.
 Sprinkle some extra flour onto the dough while you are patting it to prevent sticking.
 You can also use a 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) wide glass instead. When you run out of dough to cut, ball it up and flatten it out again. Keep cutting, balling, and flattening the dough until you've used it all up.
 Space them at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. If you run out of room on the baking sheet, save the rest of the biscuits for the next batch. If you crowd the biscuits onto the baking sheet, they will smoosh together while baking.
 You can now finish baking the rest of the biscuits, if you have any left over.
 They taste the best while they are still warm, but you can also eat them cool.
