Open Advanced Installer by either double-clicking on its desktop icon or going through the Start menu and finding it in Programs.
When the application starts, you will be given the option of choosing a project type. Choose the "simple" option.
Uncheck the Wizard checkbox. This will allow you to edit the project to your specifications.
Save the project, taking note of its destination folder. This will be where your MSI package will be created.



Choose the "Files and Folders" options on the left side of the Advanced Installer screen.
Click on "Application Folder," then on "Add Files."
Browse until you find the file you want to install, then double-click on that file to add it to the Application Folder.
Click on "Application Shortcut Folder" to add a shortcut file or any help or URL file you created to accompany the file in the Application Folder.



Click on the "Build" toolbar button on the Advanced Installer screen. A dialogue box will appear to show you the build process.
Click the "Run" toolbar button once Advanced Installer notifies you that the build is complete. This will open a setup wizard.
