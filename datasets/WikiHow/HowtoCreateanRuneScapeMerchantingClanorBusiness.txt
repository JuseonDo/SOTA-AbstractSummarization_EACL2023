 Create a new, free-to-play account on RuneScape. Name it something like "Free C E O" or something that makes you sound as if you're in charge (which you are).;
, It will raise your Mining level to 4, which is at least a start.
 You might die, so proceed with caution.
 If you don't care about archery or magic at all, trash the weapons but not the runes and arrows.
 Do this until your Attack, Strength, and Defense are all 10. Make sure you take the feathers and raw chicken. If you don't care for the Prayer skill, and want to make some money, take the bones too, and don't bury them. Once your inventory is full, bank everything you've obtained from the chicken farm. Don't take the eggs (it's a waste of time).
 This will enable you to cook the chickens you've obtained on the castle range.
 (This guide is getting long, but hang in there.)

, Complete quests that don't involve combat, and spend as little money as possible. Bank items that are the fruit of these means. There are many guides on the web that can walk you through this part.
 Sell some runes, sell the few arrows you have, sell some bones, sell some food, sell some oak logs, and sell some leather.
 Obtain an Explorer Ring (2) after completing the Beginning and Easy achievement diaries. Again, there are many walkthroughs to help you with this part.
 If you've mined essences, mining should already be there.
 Warning: Pack food. This quest is difficult and some tough enemies may try to pick a fight with you.
 Sell all of the fruits of your labor.
 Create a business name, set up the clan, and recruit. There are clan creation guides on wikiHow.
 Tell your clan to sell some items as decided by the company.
 There are many resources to help you through the details. Micromanage the company.
 Sell, sell, sell.
