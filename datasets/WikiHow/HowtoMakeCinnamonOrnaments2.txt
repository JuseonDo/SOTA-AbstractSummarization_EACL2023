 If you do not want to bake the ornaments, you can choose to air dry them instead. It will take them about 24 hours for them to air dry, however; it will only take them 7 to 10 minutes to bake., Combine the dry ingredients together first until they are evenly mixed together, then slowly add the warm water. Keep mixing and kneading until you get a thick, dough-like consistency., Take a fourth of the dough, and roll it out on a sheet of wax paper.To keep it from sticking, dust it with extra cinnamon. You can also roll it out between two sheets of plastic wrap instead.


It is easier to work with a small batch of dough than one big batch.
 You can make them any shape you wish, but stars, gingerbread men, and trees are the most popular. Once you have finished cutting them, roll out some more dough, and cut out some more shapes.
 The hole needs to be large enough so that you can thread string or ribbon through it., If you choose not to bake the ornaments, set them out to air dry for 24 hours. Flip them every 6 hours so that they can dry evenly.


Because of the flour content, these ornaments will be a lot lighter than ones makes with just cinnamon and applesauce.
 You can paint them, draw on them with glue and glitter, or leave them blank. If you want to make them look like gingerbread cookies, draw on them with white puffy paint; it will look just like icing! When you are done decorating, wait for them.
 Make sure that the loop is big enough to fit over a branch on your tree.,
