 Cut off the cuff. Cut along where the cuff meets the shirt sleeve, leaving the cuff stitching intact.
 Ensure that the side with the buttonhole is longer than the side with the button. Test it: Fold over the longer side to meet the shorter side; the buttonhole should meet the button with ease.


If you don't like the existing button, remove it and replace it with one you like better.
