 Also begin preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).
 Use your hands to mix them together until the shredded chicken is thoroughly coated in the flour and powdered milk.
 Use your hands or a spoon to mix in the chicken broth, beaten egg, and melted margarine. Semi-sticky but moldable dough should form.


You can also use water instead of chicken broth or vegetable oil instead of melted margarine.
 Roll the dough into dime-size balls and line the balls on your prepared baking sheet.
 Use your thumb or the back of a spoon.


If the dough starts sticking to your hands or to the spoon, you can spray a little nonstick cooking spray onto the balls of dough before pressing them.
 Remove them from the oven and flip each treat over to the other side.
 Take them out of the oven once they turn a golden brown on top.
 Store the extra treats in an airtight container.
