 Generally latex balloons will work best with paint as the acrylic paint typically adheres best to this material.
 Consider using acrylic paint pens instead of the paint and brushes for a more precise design.
 For example, if you are painting stars on the balloons you could place the template on top of the balloon and then paint within the template.
 Helium or blown up balloons will work for this project. Be sure you secure the ends by either tying a knot or using a clamp.
 Hold the balloon in your hand or secure it in an area so the balloon doesnâ€™t float around while you are working on it.
 Read manufacturer instructions for dry time for best results.
 Allow the other side to properly dry before you use.
