, It is important that you do not open the stairs.
 If things get to much retreat to the comm room and run in counterclockwise circles. If you get the teddy bear and the box moved to comm room you have to restart.
 you need Juggernaut so you can get twice as many hits. run in circles counterclockwise starting from the building right of the comm room, have comm door closed it will be useful for dogs, remember 24 zombie max solo. (All these strategies are Solo). For dogs go into the space left of the hut, if the hut is open dogs will come from there, if not they will spawn and follow the railing clockwise all the way to you and it will be 5-10 seconds before dog.


Same strategy as 3 but at storage.
 (The trap that spins 750 points per 30 seconds).
