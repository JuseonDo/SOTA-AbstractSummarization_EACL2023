@summary
diminish your time spent at the computer.because repetitive strain injury (rsi) in the wrists, arms, or fingers is often caused by ongoing computer use, the less time you spend on your computer as you are trying to recover the better.

@summary
modify your work environment.

@summary
take regular breaks.especially if you are unable to change your work duties and need to be on the computer for most of the day, it is important that you prioritize breaks every one to two hours to get up and walk around.

@summary
consider the psychosocial factors at your workplace.stress at the workplace has been consistently linked to worse rsi, as well as to reduced speed of healing of the condition.

@summary
begin a regular exercise routine.many people do not immediately think of an exercise routine as a potential solution to their rsi.

@summary
see a physiotherapist or a physician sooner rather than later.if you find that your rsi has persisted beyond a few weeks without improvement, it is best to seek professional help sooner rather than later.

 The caveat to this, however, is that the majority of people who develop RSI are those whose livelihood depends on computer use. If this is the case for you, speak to your employer to see if there are any alternate duties you can take on for a while, instead of constant computer use.


If your pain is particularly severe, you may want to look into a leave of absence from work for a while as you recover. This may or may not be covered under your insurance.
If your work does not require a computer but you have developed RSI from excessive computer use at home, discipline yourself to spending significantly less time on your computer as you recover.
Consider meeting with friends in person, or watching shows on TV, as alternate modes of entertainment to substitute for being on your computer.;
, Make sure you have a comfortable seat to sit in while typing, to minimize stress on your shoulders and neck as you do your computer work. Also make sure that the screen is positioned so that your work is easily visible, without having to be in an awkward position to see your computer screen. Ensure that the keyboard is positioned at a comfortable height and distance from you to minimize stress and strain on your wrists as you type., Breaking up your typing pattern will help to prevent ongoing repetitive motions, all of which contribute to worsening RSI. Even getting up for 10–15 minutes can help to loosen up your muscles. An added bonus is that the mental break may also clear your thinking and allow you to be more productive when you return to the computer!


Try setting a timer to remind you to get up every hour.
 If you are finding that work is a draining environment for you emotionally and psychologically, consider speaking to your boss and/or your coworkers about strategies to reduce your stress. You may very well find that, as your mood at work increases, your pain diminishes, as a number of studies have shown this correlation.
 However, exercises releases endorphins, which are natural pain-killers in the brain. Therefore, regular exercise has been correlated with significant pain reduction throughout the body. Try swimming, riding a stationary bike, or whatever activity interests you. As long as you do it for at least 20–30 minutes, three or more times per week, and as long as it is something that gets your heart rate up and breaks a sweat, you will reap the benefits!

, People who receive treatment sooner have been shown to end up with better healing and results than those who wait to have their RSI evaluated by a professional.
