 You can use white or clear primer for this. This will help give your lashes extra length and volume.If you have dark lashes and want to use a lighter color, prime your lashes with white mascara. You can also use a spoolie dipped in white, liquid liner instead., This is especially important if your used white primer. If you don't wait long enough, you risk transferring some of that color back into your liquid liner.
 Use the brush that came with the liquid liner, and carefully run it along your lashes. Start from the base of your lash, and finish at the tip.
 If you won't wait long enough, some of that color might transfer onto your brow bone. If you close your eye all the way, you might end up with some color transfer on the area just below your eyes.
 After this, you are done, and ready to rock your new look!
