 The entire dash does not need to come out. Simply remove the center consoles, the driver side lower panel, and the glovebox. This will expose the ducts that need to be separated from the airbox.
 Go to the HVAC control section of the VAG-Com software and run a full test. You should hear the various flaps and motors working.,, Now is a great time to clean it out. Open the flap by hand and clean out any debris. Mine was clogged full of leaves and Kleenex.,, these just snap out., I used a few broom sticks to slowly pry the box out. Be sure to remove all wiring, vac lines, and the large hose clamp holding the rubber sleeve on., Remove all the screws and clips. Many screws are hidden, so be careful, and don't force anything., Remove all the sealant before removing the core. Use 100% silicone when re-sealing the new core., Clean it out before reassembly. Now would be a great time to replace the blower motor. These fail often, and you don't want to repeat this job., Re-assemble. See note warnings section.
