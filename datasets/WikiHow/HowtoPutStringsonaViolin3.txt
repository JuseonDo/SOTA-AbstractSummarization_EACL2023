 You can buy strings in a variety of thicknesses, tensions, and styles. Experiment some with different sizes to get a sense of what sounds best with your particular style of playing and your wishes for your sound.


Thicker strings put out more volume, resonating with a thicker vibration, while thinner strings tend to be brighter and sunnier. Try a set of each and see what you like.
 The most basic form of strings used on violins are made of steel alloy, often wrapped in nickel. The higher E string is usually plated with some other metal. They tend to have less stretch and durability than other strings, but are by far the cheapest and most widely available strings you can buy. They're most recommended for beginners and if you're changing a string for the first time.
 With a warm sound a quick response, the next step up in the market is rope core steel, which is similar to steel core strings, but braided from more material, giving the player a bright, clear attack on the strings. These strings are commonly used by fiddle players., It doesn't get any more visceral than this: gut strings are made of the intestinal tissue of sheep or lambs. While somewhat gross, these strings feature an incomparably warm and lively sound. Gut strings are somewhat fussy, requiring lots of tuning adjustment. They're greatly affected by weather and temperature as well, making them more useful for very experienced players. Combine with a traditional horse-hair bow and you'll be playing with the same basic ingredients as the old masters.
 Since playing on the colon of a dead animal isn't everyone's bag, manufacturers went about the business of replicating the sound and response of gut strings, but with a much less fussy and reliable. They're also somewhat expensive., Violin companies Hill and Westminster make E strings available separately from their respective sets and are popular inexpensive choices to experiment with.
