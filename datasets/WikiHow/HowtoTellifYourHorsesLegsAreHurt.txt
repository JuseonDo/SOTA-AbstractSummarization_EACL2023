@article
 Is it bearing weight evenly on all four limbs? Painful limbs will commonly be held off the ground (non-weight bearing) or be held slightly in front of the opposite limb (pointing)., Is its gait normal and it is advancing and bearing weight normally on all limbs? Is it bucking or shying away from pressure?

, If you see scratches, swellings, lacerations, etc. take a closer look and consider calling your veterinarian.
 Pay attention to heat or a painful reaction to your touch. Check for symmetry and smaller lesions that you may not have seen earlier.
 If it is clearly lame, call your veterinarian. If the horse looks sound, trot the horse in hand and observe. Lameness is not evident at the walk, but you will notice them at the trot. Horses are good at hiding their injuries and lameness may be subtle, so observe the horse moving from several different angles. Get someone else to trot the horse for you if necessary. Again, if the horse appears lame, call your veterinarian.
