 Working from home has many benefits. You may be tempted to wear your pajamas everyday. Resist it. Check your emails with a cup of coffee first thing in the morning, but when your work day begins you should be dressed appropriately. It's all the about how you feel. Think about how different you feel in the evenings when you are in your comfy PJ’s – relaxed and winding down. This is not the mindset you would want to project on the phone when speaking to clients or bosses. Keep it professional all round and your results will reflect your professionalism.
 You will be dealing with the professional world. You will report to bosses and communicate with fellow employees. Conduct yourself with professional decorum during these interactions. Avoid inappropriate jokes. Be polite. Be congenial., You wouldn't do house chores, while you were at work elsewhere. Don't do them while working at home either. This is something that will take practice, but avoid all the home distractions as best you can. If there are home chores that need to be attended to, prioritize them. Sure, if it's raining outside and all your windows are open, you may want to attend to that right away, but generally everything else can wait. Watching an episode of your favorite TV show or taking your suit to the dry cleaners is not going to put money in your account.
