 Even the ones that were placed on the child for even the slightest second, should be thrown out. Diapers that were only used for a second, could be contaminated by sweat, that is not hygienic to a potential other user. Those "used" diapers can never be donated, no matter the reason or length of time usage on the child.;
, Keep them stacked in an upright position, much like you found them when you opened the package.
 Use a wrapping technique that will secure the package around the diapers. Make sure that the package can be folded around as much of the remainder of the product, so air cannot seep into it.
 See if they'll accept your donation of unused diapers. Most daycare centers will accept these diapers without much of a hassle. Make sure to explain to them that you have thrown out those diapers your child has used, if any still exist.
 Preschools are your only backup. Not all schools will take them, due to possible school regulations of used belongings.
,,, They'll gladly take and accept them.
 They have gladly helped you out by taking them, so what better way to reward them, than by saying "Thank you".
