,, Reliable web hosting is very important because your wiki needs to be up and running at all times.
 Some common themes are encyclopedia wikis, educational or instructional wikis, and wikis that provide a niche service such as music lyrics.
 Think of other ways to reward them, such as giving out a virtual star when they start a new article. Create a sense of community and belonging, and make your contributors feel they are a valued part of an important cause. In this way you satisfy their emotional needs while they help you satisfy your financial needs.
 Make sure administrators know their future at your wiki will not be bright if they don’t toe the company line, which is to generate as many articles as possible (to maximize page views, which in turn generates advertising revenue).
 Through this person you can set the tone for how all the administrators are to act, and exert a certain amount of control. Don’t hire more than one or two people for this, as other administrators will be working for you for free.
, Particularly search engine sites like Google.
 When the right offer comes along, sell your wiki for a profit and move on.
