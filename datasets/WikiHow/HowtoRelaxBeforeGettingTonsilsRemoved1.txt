, This may sound simple, but it helps. Sitting down and taking slow, deep breaths will calm you down and clear your mind.
 If you know that listening to music calms you, then try it! Turn on classical music (or your preference), and in no time you'll be feeling better!

, When you're worrying, just find something small to do, like cleaning or organizing, and that'll take your mind off of the operation.
 Sometimes, the only way to get something out of your mind is to let your self think about it. It doesn't have to be for long, but just a little may help. As you think about it, tell yourself that it isn't going to be as bad as it seems. It's actually a very smooth procedure, and the healing only takes 1-2 weeks.
