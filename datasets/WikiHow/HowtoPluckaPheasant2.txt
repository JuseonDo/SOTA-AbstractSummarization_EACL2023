@summary
soak the birds quickly in hot water to make plucking much faster and easier.

@summary
set a large pot of water on the stove until it reaches roughly 140–150 °f (60–66 °c).

@summary
holding it by the neck, dunk the body of the pheasant into the scalding water for 30 seconds.

@summary
remove the bird, draining over the pot until water no longer streams down the sides.

@summary
dunk and drain the bird two more times so it "cooks" for 90 seconds total.

@summary
quickly pluck the pheasant as if you were doing a normal dry pluck.

@summary
heat and pluck only one pheasant at a time.

 Dunking the birds into simmering water for 90 seconds will make the skin looser and the feathers more likely to slide out. It can weaken the skin a bit, and is likely overkill if you only have to clean 1-2 birds. However, if you have a large number of pheasants to pluck, this will save you tons of time.


Make sure the pot is big enough to fit a whole bird.
While this makes plucking faster, you only want to soak one pheasant at a time., The important thing is that the water is steaming, but not yet boiling. This is shortly after the water becomes too hot to touch. You want to scald the pheasants, not cook them.
 This will heat the skin and feathers, but won't allow any of it to actually start cooking.
 Remove the bird just long enough that it stops pouring water off it. This will temporarily cool it down.
 You want to work quickly, as it is the heat, not the water, that makes plucking easier., You should have your work station, with garbage bag and newspaper, already laid out. Let the last bits of water drain off, then get to work plucking while the pheasant is still hot. All of the normal rules apply:


Only remove 1-2 feathers at a time.
Hold the skin around the feathers tight with your supporting hand.
Use quick, forceful movements to yank out feathers., Remember that the heat, not the water, is what makes plucking easier. Don't try and dunk all of your pheasants at once, then pluck them all afterwards. Heat a pheasant, pluck it, then move on to the next one when it is done.
