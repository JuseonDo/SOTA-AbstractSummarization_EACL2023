 It should be large enough for your torso region or the torso region of the costume wearer. It should be sturdy enough for wearing (you don't want it flopping over).;
, Draw the circles first, then use a craft knife on a safe cutting surface to cut out the circles.
 Use a pencil or the end of scissors to make the holes.
 Tie one end around the hole and leave the other end dangling. Be sure to use good lengths of twine or rope (see next step).
 However, leave enough space in between for your body, as one circle will sit on your back, one on your front. The twine or rope sits over your shoulders, so keep this in mind when deciding on the final length.
 Using leftover pieces of cardboard, cut out shapes that resemble stylized depictions of the sun's rays.
 If gluing on, allow to dry before proceeding to the next step.
 Mostly yellow but some orange and red touches to heat it up are fine.
