 Make sure to distribute the wax evenly on your hands, and don't use too much-- there is no way to get it out other than washing your hair.
 Secure your hair with a strong ponytail holder. It is important to tie your hair as tightly as possible, otherwise some strands may come undone while you play sports.
 You can use one, or add a second for extra hold. Put one half an inch from your hairline, and the second about an inch behind the first. The headbands also add an element of style and color to your sports look.
