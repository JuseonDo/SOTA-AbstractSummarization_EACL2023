 Wash it by hand prior to the first use. In the future, it is not recommended that you use soap on your stoneware, or it will remove the seasoning.;
,, It can cause a sticky surface that prevents seasoning.
, You should not pre-heat the stoneware. It can be placed directly inside a preheated oven, even when refrigerated before use.
 Fill it to two-thirds full. If you are using a muffin pan, fill each of the compartments two-thirds full of oil.
, Set it to cool on a wire rack or other sturdy surface. Turn off the oven.
 The pan should cool completely and absorb some of the oil.
 Reserve the oil for future seasoning or use. You can also funnel it back into an oil container.
 Then, bake with it within the next few days.
 Then, it should remain coated so that you have a non-stick surface for the remaining time you use it.


Keep in mind that the darker and “dirtier” the stoneware looks, the better the surface will be for baking. The light coating of oil will stay on the pan, so that you don’t need to add too much oil or fat.
