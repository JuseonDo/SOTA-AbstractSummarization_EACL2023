@summary
before entering slow flight the pilot needs to maintain the airplane in cruising speeds and keep the same altitude.perform 1st clearing turn.

@summary
perform pre-flight check list.turn carb heat on.progressively bring the throttle back to 1500-1700 rpm to decelerate slow flight speeds.

@summary
once airspeed indicator is in white arc, move flaps to 10 degrees.

@summary
perform second clearing turn.

@summary
once wings are level move flaps to 30 degrees.

@summary
add power to approximately 2000 rpm whenever getting close to 55 kias or as needed to keep altitude.

@summary
to perform power-off stall:

@summary
lower nose as if looking at a runway for landing purposes.

@summary
to recover put the nose down (plane faces the ground) add full power.(nose up) climb back to initial altitude at 70 kias.

After reaching cruising speeds of about 90 KIAS and about 2500 RPM a HASEL check is required.
A hassle check consists of a few steps to be safe while in flight and making sure a pilot can follow through with their intentions. check for H-eight, A-rea, S-ecurity, E-ngine, L-ookout. Including 2 clearing turns.;
,, (seatbelts/shoulder harnesses, fuel shut-off value, & fuel mixture),,,

Pull back on controls (nose up) to maintain altitude.
 During turn move flaps to 20 degrees.

Pull back on controls (nose up) to maintain altitude.


Pull back on controls (nose up) to maintain altitude.


While in flight the left hand controls the airspeed and the right hand controls the altitude.
Movements are exaggerated (e.g. turns, rudder, etc.)
Slow flight is usually around 55 KIAS and the slow flight signs are low airspeed, unresponsive aileron and possibly stall horn.

Progressively begin nose up attitude (flare) and wait for stall.
To recover from stall, immediately add power and pull up nose (to level plane) simultaneously. Carb heat cold and slowly/incrementally return flaps to 0 degrees.


Carb heat cold.
