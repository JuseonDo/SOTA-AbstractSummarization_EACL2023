axial resistors are cylindrical with leads extending from each end.

@summary
look at the resistor so the group of 3 or 4 color bands are on the left side.

@summary
read the color bands from left to right.

;
, These are sometimes followed by a gap, then an additional color band.
 The colors on the first 2 or 3 bands correspond to numbers from 0 to 9, which represent the significant digits of the resistor's ohmic value. The last band gives the multiplier. For example, a resistor with brown, green and green bands is rated at 15 mega-ohms (15,000,000 ohms). The code is as follows:


Black: 0 significant digit, multiplier of 1
Brown: 1 significant digit, multiplier of 10
Red: 2 significant digit, multiplier of 100
Orange: 3 significant digit, multiplier of 1,000 (kilo)
Yellow: 4 significant digit, multiplier of 10,000 (10 kilo)
Green: 5 significant digit, multiplier of 100,000 (mega)
Blue: 6 significant digit, multiplier of 1,000,000 (10 mega)
Violet: 7 significant digit
Gray: 8 significant digit
White: 9 significant digit
Gold: multiplier of 1/10
Silver: multiplier of 1/100

, This represents the tolerance of the resistor. If there is no color band, the tolerance is 20 percent. Most resistors have no band, a silver band or a gold band, but you may find resistors with other colors. The tolerance color code is as follows:

,,,,,,,,,, Several exist, so choose the one that you won't forget. Remember that the first color is black, and afterward each first letter corresponds to a color in order from 0 to 9. Some popular mnemonic devices include:


"Bad beer rots our young guts but vodka goes well."
"Bright boys rave over young girls but veto getting wed."
