 This way you will know the height adjustment that needs to be made on the chair.
 For pneumatic chairs this will be a lever or button. For non-pneumatic chairs, this will be a thick turning bolt. All levers, buttons, and turning bolts are typically located directly underneath the seat of the office chair itself.
 Pressing up will make the chair go up while pressing down will make the chair go down. Use only 1 hand to do this, as you will need the other hand for the following step.
 Do this gently, slowly moving the chair only inches (or centimeters) at a time.
 The chair should automatically lock itself into place once you release the lever or button.

,, This height of the chair is correct when you are able to sit in the chair with your feet flat on the floor, your knees are bent at a little bit larger than a 90-degree angle and are positioned lower than your waist. If the chair height is still incorrect, repeat the previous steps until the chair has reached its correct height adjustment.
