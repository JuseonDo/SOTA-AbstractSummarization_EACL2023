 Most of the time when a net is required, you will be netting for someone else. When your partner gets a fish on, be ready to drop what you are doing and get the net.
 If you just set the rod down, you are going to lose it., If the angler just wants to swing the fish over the side, you'll be in the way if you are standing there with a big net., Some nets have collapsible handles, so make sure that the net is completely secure and ready for service., Submerge as much of the rim of the net as you can, but leave some of it out so that the angler can clearly see where he needs to get the fish., Simply leave the net in the water and allow the angler to lead it in.,, If the fish is large, do not scoop, rather hold the handle of the net in a vertical fashion and lift the net out of the water., Don't place it on the front or back deck where the fish could get back into the water with a single leap. The bottom of the boat is much safer.
