, An inventory is a list of all the assets you own that are worth anything. To keep it simple, you should only consider assets that are of relevance; so list cars, houses, motorbikes, bank accounts, CDs, 401-ks, etc.; but skip the skirts in your closet, the books in your shelves, or the old TV.
 Be sure to be realistic; even though you paid 1299 $ for that plasma TV, what could you seriously get if you sold it now? Most household articles loose 50% right when you take them out of the shop. On the other hand, cars lose about 50% every three years, and houses only a small percentage if at all. Of course, bank accounts and cash is worth its current total.
 Spend some time to make the list complete; don't leave out things because they are 'kind of special' or 'everyone has them', or 'they will be soon gone'. For everything you owe, put the amount in the value column as a negative number.
 This is your net worth.
