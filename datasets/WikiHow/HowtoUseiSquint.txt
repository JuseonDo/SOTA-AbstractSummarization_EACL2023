,, You can only download the video if it has not played or buffered all the way.



If you use Mozilla Firefox, you can download the Add-On UnPlug and use it to obtain video and audio which is embedded on a webpage (get_video file). Once you've downloaded the program, click on the green fish in the upper right hand corner. Click on the link containing "get_video" above the text "Type: Flash Video Data (this is probably the one you want)" to download the file.
 There should be a file still downloading, and it is often the largest. Double click that file to download the video. A new blank page will open in Safari.
 It will appear on your desktop as "get_video".
,, Checking "H.264 Coding" will encode with higher quality, but will take longer. There are other options you can chose from, so customize all you want.
 When finished there will be a loud "ding!" The saved file will probably change to a Quicktime MP4 video on your desktop. You may have to drag the MP4 file into your "Movies" in iTunes manually.
