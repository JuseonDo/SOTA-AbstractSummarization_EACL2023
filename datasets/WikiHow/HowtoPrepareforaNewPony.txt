, Remember that different horses live in different conditions e.g. some may live outside all year round and others need permanent stabling. A horse needs between one and one and a half acres of space in a field. Horses are also herd animals and should have company at all times.


Remember that irrespective of the accommodation all animals need a plentiful supply of clean water and food.
It is best to find a stable yard in your area with people who can help you and this will provide company for your horse.
 These should be in good condition as they will hopefully last a long time.
 Brushes, combs, plaiting gear, shampoos, fly sprays, and so on. It is also useful to get grooming boxes so that everything is accessible and easy to carry., Even if they are un-clipped and live in a stable 24/7 they will still need warm rugs for cold weather., from the previous owner, it may be useful to get spares, or anything you think you need but don't have., Lunging gear, traveling gear (although your new horse should come with some), fancy training items, lots of supplements, competition gear, etc. Most of this stuff is not needed right away but if you keep the horse you WILL need it in the future., Remember to get spares since horses can stand on or chew anything left with them overnight.
 You should begin with what your horse's previous owners used to use and only gradually swap over to something else if you need to.


The feed your horse will require is dependent on the horse's weight and the type and amount of work that they do so always check the bag of feed or supplier for more information.
 An equine first aid kit is essential and although other people may have one on hand for emergencies it's best to be prepared!,


Contact the farrier beforehand to check prices etc. as any horse will need to see a farrier approx. once every 4-6 weeks regardless of whether it is shod.
