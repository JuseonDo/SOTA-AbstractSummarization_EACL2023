 Depending on your version of Windows, this will be found in different areas.


Windows 8: Press the Windows button (Start button) to the left of the Alt key. Then, type "Control Panel." Press the icon when it appears below the text field.
Windows 7, Vista, and XP: Press the Windows button (Start button) to the left of the Alt key. Then, type "Control Panel." Press the icon when it appears above the text field. You can also open up the Start menu by pressing the icon in the bottom left of your screen.
 Click on the HomeGroup header which pops up after you complete the search.



Note that the button will only be enabled if you are not currently in a HomeGroup. If you are, leave your current HomeGroup.
 The first screen will just tell you what a HomeGroup does.
 You will be able to choose from: Pictures, Documents, Music, Printers, and Videos. Depending on your needs, select or deselect the file types. Click next.
 This will be the password that other devices will need to enter in order to connect to the HomeGroup. Then, click finish.
 Instead of creating a new group, join the group and enter the password when prompted. You will now be able to share files over the network.
