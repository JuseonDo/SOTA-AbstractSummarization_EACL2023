 While this heats up, mince the garlic and chop up onions and mushrooms, if desired.;
, The garlic should be slightly golden.


Add the mushrooms and onions as well, along with an extra 1/2 tablespoon of butter.
 Stir everything well with a whisk or wooden spoon.
 Raise the heat and quickly bring the sauce to a boil so that many bubbles are reaching the surface and popping. Do not let the sauce keep boiling -- you only need it to reach this temperature quickly.
 Stir the flour in quickly after lowering the heat. The sauce should be simmering, with a few bubbles breaking on the surface.
 You can simmer the sauce for as long as you want before serving. The longer you leave it on, the thicker and richer it will be.


If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add hot broth to thin it out without sacrificing flavor.
 White wine sauce pairs well with chicken and shellfish in particular. Some recipes to try include:


Shrimp, cracked red or cayenne pepper, sauteed onions and bell pepper
Chicken, broccoli, and peas
Chicken, mushrooms and onions.
Sauteed carrots, onions, and zucchini, lemon, cracked black pepper.
