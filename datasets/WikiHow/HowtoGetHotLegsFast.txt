, If you want to challenge yourself, hold a medicine ball or any other slightly heavy object.
, Be prepared to ache a bit - it will be worth it!

, Sit with your back straight, making sure your thighs are parallel to the ground. Hold this position for the entire song if you can, or at least until your legs start to shake.
 Find a flat wall and lean against it, standing straight up. Slowly squat down, as if you were sitting in a chair, and keep leaning against the wall. Do not adjust your position. Play another song for about three minutes, and keep your position until it is over., Stretching will help build long, lean muscles and prevent cramps.
 Also exfoliate with a salt or sugar scrub and massage a lotion of your choice on your legs.
 Remember that it will hurt a lot for the next few days, and without the perseverance, you will not be able to continue. Make sure that you also do not have any sports competitions or PE in school within this week as your legs will not have enough energy to hold up for that much effort for the first few days you are doing this routine. And finally, show em off!
