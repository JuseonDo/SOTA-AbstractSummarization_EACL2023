@article
 Do not buy clothing that you will not be able to pair up with other items that you already have in your wardrobe.
 As cute as an item may be, if it is going to remain on the hanger more often than not, it is not worth the money spent on it.
 Keep predominantly to colors that work well together.
 If you find that you feel confident in black then stick to blacks. Incorporate more dresses into your wardrobe if you are generally more comfortable in dresses. Pregnancy is not the time to switch things up and become more daring.
