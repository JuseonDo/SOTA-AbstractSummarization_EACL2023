 If you're looking for a large number of items, prepare a detailed list specifying each tape by: artist & title, along with any other particulars that help identify the item like catalog number, label, condition , country of manufacture (if you only collect US Tapes for example). Many tape dealers will gladly accept your want list and actively look for them for you, greatly expanding your searching capabilities.;
, What should you expect to pay? - like most collectibles, old tapes can vary greatly in value. Do a little research by using your favourite Internet search engine and find out what similar tapes are being sold for.
 With your list of preferred dealers / contacts prepared, send your want list to those most likely to specialise in what you're looking for.
