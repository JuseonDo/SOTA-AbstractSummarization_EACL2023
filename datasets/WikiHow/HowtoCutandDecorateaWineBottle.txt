, Avoid overlapping lines.
 Place the wine bottle with the drawn line over the lit candle. Make sure that the fire is pointed up to the drawn line or angle on the bottle, so that the flame only meets the line on the bottle.
 How you position it depends on where the line you have drawn is around the bottle––let the flame of the candle heat whatever line you have drawn. Do this for a minute, rotating the bottle through the heat of the fire.
 Repeat until you start to hear the bottle crack; bit by bit a cracking sound of glass will be heard.
 The half of the bottle will either fall off or crack into two parts. If neither happens, lightly pull or tug on one half so that the exertion will cause the bottle to part into two pieces.


Do not hit or screw the bottle to into two parts, as this will cause the bottle to crack into more parts or may not part evenly.
 Using sandpaper or a glass file, smoothly file down the glass evenly. This will allow you to handle glass without worry about being cut.
