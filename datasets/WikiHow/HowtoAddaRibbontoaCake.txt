 The width will depend on the height of the cake and what you think looks best. In general, a wide ribbon is best for a tall cake and for a fruit or Christmas (or other special holiday event) cake, while slimmer ribbons can be used singly, or in duplicate or triplicate to form different patterns around smaller, lower cakes.

A ribbon that is broad enough to cover the entire side of the cake can alleviate the need to add icing or frosting to the cake sides, thereby cutting down on an additional source of sugar and perhaps fat if you're using buttercream. It looks elegant and is a great way to dress up a tall cake.
 Leave a small amount extra on the length to allow for neatly tucking under when encircling the cake., Avoid getting icing or frosting on the front, as it will show., This piece should have a dab of icing or frosting behind it. Then take the ribbon all the way around the cake, with a dab at even intervals to ensure that it stays on., Cut off any excess ribbon sticking out.,, If you'd like to make your own, see How to make bows. The bow needs to be tight and not likely to come loose; this may necessitate stitching it into shape before using.,, Either use one large bow once in a strategic position, or use several smaller bows spaced around the ribbon at even intervals., These can be attached either straight to the cake or on the ribbon, using the icing or frosting dabs.
