 Examples include thick, dark clothing, long sleeves, long pants, and remember to tuck pants into socks. Make sure that your children always wear shoes and hats. You may also want to get into the habit of checking your children's clothes and hair for ticks. Also, don't wear any shade of blue, as this attracts mosquitoes and sometimes bees.;
, Make sure they know to shake them out before using them.
 You may also want to stay away from locations that are popular for insects and mosquitoes to hang out, such as water holes, streams, tall grass, and dense forest areas. Look around for bee hives and nests before pitching your tent.
 Geranoil, Linalool, and Citronella are the popular choices. Just make sure they are not accessible to the younger children.
 For example, show them areas where they cannot play because mosquitoes, insects, and spiders may live there, and show them how to freeze if a stinging insect flies near them.
 Make sure your children get into that habit too. You may also want to invest in mosquito nets if you are sleeping in a cabin in the wilderness, as well as window screens. You may also want to consider screening an area for eating and preparing food outside, and get your children into the habit of eating and drinking within that parameter.
 Keep your garbage secure and away from your camping area. The trunk of your car is a good spot.
