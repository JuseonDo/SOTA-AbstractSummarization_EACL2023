Apply the vegetable oil around the edge of the drain so that it glides down into the pipe, clinging to the sides.
 Place several strips of clear tape over the drain, sticky-side down, sealing it off completely.


Allow the tape to remain on the drain for roughly 24 hours.
 Peel off each strip of tape the next day. Gnats should be stuck on the bottom.


If you do not catch any gnats this way, you can try again, this time leaving a small gap of open space in the layer of tape. Sometimes, insects will not fly upward unless they feel a draft of air coming from the opening.
Repeat this procedure as often as necessary until you no longer spot any gnats coming out of your drain.
