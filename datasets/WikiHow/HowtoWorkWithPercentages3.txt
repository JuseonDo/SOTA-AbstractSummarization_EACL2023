look for the "is", "of", and "what" (or possibly "how much").

@summary
here's what to do: change the percentage back to a decimal, so 32% is 0.32 and 75% is 0.75 and 150% is 1.5 and 6% is 0.06, and so forth.

,

@summary
use the equation: % x (whole amt) = (partial amt).
@article
 If the "is" and the "what" are closely associated, like in the question "what is 10% of 16?", then you have a "no partial amount" problem.
, In other words, you multiply the percent with the entire amount.


Example: "what is 10% of 16?". Enter 0.10, hit multiply, enter 16, hit equals. The answer is 1.6 (notice, noÂ % sign on the answer).






Example: "230% of 40 is what?". Enter 2.3, hit multiply, enter 40, hit equals. The answer: 92.






Example: "how much is 37% of 200?". Enter 0.37, hit multiply, enter 200, hit equals. Answer: 74.
