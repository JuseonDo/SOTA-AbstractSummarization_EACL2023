 Removing a background is easiest when it is a very different color from the foreground (say, as in a graduation photo). It’s hardest when the colors are similar, for example, with a white horse standing in the snow. For best results, plan ahead: Shoot your foreground subject against a different and uniform color such as the sky or a painted wall. As an example, removing the sky in the top photo will be easy. Removing the background in the lower photo with smaller green trees will be hard.;
, Click "Photo Editor," then "Expert" in the top menu bar.
,, A sub-window appears at the bottom. In the bottom menu, click the pink Eraser and Scissor Icon.
 (You don’t have to be precise.)

, An area with similar colors is erased. Note the checkerboard, which means that all color is removed from that area. If too much is erased, then use "Edit > Undo" in the top menu, and try again in different spot. Trial and error is important to get the best results. Concentrate on easy areas first.


Hard areas are erased either by changing the parameters of the Background Eraser Tool, or by carefully painting out the background by hand. For best results, many photos require both.
 Your goal is to erase as much as possible, without erasing anything you want to keep in the photo.
 Identify areas where you still want more background removed.
 The basic Eraser would be useful, to refer back to the earlier example, erasing the snow in the background of a white horse.
 Carefully erase unwanted background. Drag the brush over small areas, using Undo whenever you have erased too much.
 Using the default file type PSD leaves you the most options for future editing. For a smaller file suitable for Web and email, choose JPEG, and then click OK to use the defaults.
 Later, when you cut-and-paste the photo on top of another, you will discover that the original background is gone, and your second photo is now the background.
