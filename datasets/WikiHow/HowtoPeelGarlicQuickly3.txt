 This tool usually costs between $2 and $5. Most peelers are a small silicone cylinder, while some are a flat sheet that you roll up yourself.
 Remove them from the outer edge first. If you plan to use all the cloves, separate the whole bulb with force from the heel of your hand.
 Place the tube on the cutting board to catch the skins. If you are using a flat sheet peeler, roll the cloves up inside the rubber sheet and hold it so it doesn’t unravel.
 Repeat until you have rolled each section of the tube that contains garlic. Apply a good amount of pressure.









The silicone barrier will protect your hands from the rough garlic.
 If using a flat garlic peeler, just unroll it. Discard the skins.
