 Take a few minutes at the beginning of each class to make name tags and play a small game where you point to someone, and they give their name, age, and a hobby or two.;
, Go in order, but improvise if needed. Go with the flow and remember that these are just little kids, so ANYTHING could happen.
 Ask the class questions about the main idea and the details to ensure that they understood it. Ask them the moral of the story, and what lessons it taught. Also, encourage the class to share any real-life stories they have that relate to the lesson.
 The ideal class project will be both enjoyable and will somehow relate to the day's lesson.
 At the end, ask the kids what their favorite part of the day was. Ask if there was something else they would have enjoyed doing.
 to keep the children busy while they wait for their parents to pick them up, begin the activity immediately after class ends.
