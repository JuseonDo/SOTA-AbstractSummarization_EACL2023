@summary
place the bottom of the stem into the hole.

 Areas of an outdoor garden that receive at least six full hours of direct sunlight are considered "full sun," while areas that receive three to six hours of direct sun are labeled as "partial sun." Eastern and southern areas of the garden that receive the sunlight in the morning and early afternoon are most preferable.
 Loose soil promotes better drainage and makes it easier for the roots to spread.
 Compost provides the plant with nutrients and sand allows the soil to drain more effectively. Manure and perlite can be used as substitutes for the two additives, respectively. Dig these elements into the top 1/2 to full foot (15 to 30 centimeters) of soil.
 For instance, if you grew your seedling in a 4-inch (10-centimeter) plastic seedling tray, then you should dig a 4-inch (10-centimeter) hole.
 The soil should stay intact around the roots.
 Cover it with soil and gently pat the soil around the stem to hole it in place.
 Soak the soil with water from a hose or watering can until the surface of the soil is visibly damp.
 The pole should be inserted into the ground about 1 foot (30 centimeters) behind the jasmine to avoid interfering with its roots. As it grows, you will need to train it to climb this support.
