 Your dog should also know what his name is and be responsive to it. If he can't do these things reliably, you will need to teach him these basic commands first.;
, Hold a treat or toy so that he can see it, but don't let him eat the treat yet. If necessary, wave the treat a little to be sure that he is paying attention.
 He should lower his head to keep his eyes on the treat.


Immediately praise and pet him.
Let him have the treat and take out another one in readiness.
If using a clicker, click just prior to giving your dog his treat.
 Don't worry if your dog stands up straight away. He will learn to associate the treat (and clicker if using) with the movement after repetition.
 Say your dog's name, then add an appropriate phrase, such as "Bow" or "Stretch". Say the word as your dog gets into position, for example, "Fido! Bow!".


Use your hand coming down to the floor to indicate to your dog to bring his head to the ground.
Give the treat as before. If using a clicker, click just prior to giving the treat.



Continue with the verbal cue and moving your hand to the ground.
Switch to a pretend treat. When you open your hand on the floor, it should contain nothing.
Instead, give the treat after opening your empty hand. Give the treat with your other hand.



Give your dog lots of praise and treat every time you see the desired bow action. You can use the praise and treat method to reward natural bows every time that you see them, provided you associate the praise with the word "Bow" or whatever word you wish to use. By association, your dog may learn to bow naturally.Always reinforce an action you have taught your dog with praise treats and love.
