 Only then can you handle the situation right. Otherwise, it can get more complicated.;
, Some mean things can end up as harmless jokes between friends, but without voice modulation, deciding such things can be hard. Ask your friend, "you are kidding, right?" Include a smiley face to indicate you know. If they deny, keep persisting. After about the 2nd time and they still say they are serious, move on to the next step.
 Most people reside with other people, and it could always be someone else pretending to be your fiend when really, it is a family member. Ask yourself the following questions:


Is this a true friend? If this person has stuck with you through hardships and not betrayed you several times, then most likely, they are a true friend. Or do you find this person back-stabbing you or other friends? Does he/she use you for homework, studies, etc?
Is this person likely to really be mean to you? If it is a true friend, the answer is no. If not, then it is possible. Keep in mind what this person has done with other people too, a betraying friend can betray anyone.
 You are never like this.
Please tell me if you are kidding. I am really having a hard time now understanding.
Are you mad at me?

, Have any of your actions been things which could have aggravated this? Keep in mind the friend may have been offended but have hidden it.
 Is this person prone to jealousy? Insecurity? Or has someone else, an enemy, instigated the "friend" against you?

, If in reality, this is the person they claim to be, then their goal is to offend you through themselves and they want to prove it is themselves. If they will not answer a security question (may make excuses) or get it wrong, then most likely, this is not your friend.
