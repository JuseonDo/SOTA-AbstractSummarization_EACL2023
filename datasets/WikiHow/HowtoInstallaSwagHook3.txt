 This method requires that the threaded rod be installed into the the swag, and the the toggle nut is spun only so far that the threaded rod protrudes out of the end by about two or three threads. The toggle nut should be installed so that the wings can be depressed against the threaded rod (towards the base of the swag hook). This same method is used to suspend objects from hooks in the ceiling. When using this method for ceiling installations, only the lightest loads or ornamental type loads should be considered, as this support method is the least robust.
 Holes 1/2" or greater are not uncommon.
, Press the swag against the ceiling to ensure that the wings have popped open. Twist the swag hook clockwise while gently pulling downward.
