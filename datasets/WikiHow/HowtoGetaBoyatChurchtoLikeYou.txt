 If you know he's staring at you then look up slowly at him, hold his gaze, and then slowly smile and look down at your bible or the teacher/preacher.;
, If you're feeling confident, sing a solo during the offering or if your church has a choir, then join it. Use your talents to your advantage and make sure you create a positive image of yourself.
 Get to know him better! You can do this by starting with small talk. Ask him little things such as 'how has your week been?' or if you already know a bit about him, ask about something he is passionate about (this also opens doors to you complimenting him about his interest or something he does well in).
 Use this time to express your true feelings and be honest.
 Don't make fun of him but joke around with him, get to know him, have inside jokes, and if he jokes with you then punch him lightly on the shoulder. It's a great way to make physical contact and to show you're interested.
 Ladies, don't be scared to take the lead/charge in the relationship.
 After all, being yourself and staying true to your personality is what's going to make him attracted to you and hopefully create a long-lasting relationship. Wear clothes that cover more skin than they show, try a longer skirt and a nice top. You can still look gorgeous without showing lots of skin and he will notice you for it! Finally, watch your language. Avoid using vulgar or offensive words around him and others (if you say something, he might find out and you could potentially create a bad image of yourself in his mind).
