get a pencil box.

@summary
find some markers, and fill the rectangle with whatever you want.

@summary
now that it's colored with marker, find a bottle of wet white glue, like elmer's glue, that dries clear, and squeeze a little bit of it into the recessed area.

@summary
wait for the glue to dry, a day or two later.

finished.

 On the middle of the lid there is usually a recessed rectangle with the company's logo on it.;
, Do you want the bookmark completely blue? Or do you want it rainbow-colored?. You can also draw to make the bookmark more interesting.
 Then use your fingers and spread it all around. Make sure you have enough of the glue on there because you don't want your bookmark to be too thin.
 Remove the bookmark from the recessed area. Voil√†, a nice, cool, sturdy, and most of all, free bookmark!
