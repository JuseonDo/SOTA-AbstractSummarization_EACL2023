 Use a brush or comb to eliminate tangles and knots. Even if you choose to do a messy fishtail, you won't want any snags. Brush your hair back, away from your forehead and behind your head. For a polished look and to prevent flyaways, try finger-combing a smoothing serum through your hair before you get started. Hair can be dry or wet, though it can be easier to braid wet hair if yours is curly or wavy.If your hair is fine or layered, use a little styling cream or gel to keep hair from slipping out of the pleat.
For a messier look, you can forget the brush and finger-comb your hair, but be certain you still get out any snags. Work a little styling product in for texture.
For a side braid, brush your hair to the side, over your shoulder.
, Hold the left section in your left hand, the right section in your right hand.
 Cross this piece over the right section and to the inside of the left section. This becomes part of the left section--you don't need to keep it separated.
 Cross this piece over the left section of hair and join it to the inside of the right section.
 You are essentially making an "X" with your hair.

To prevent flyaways and give your hair overall shine, spritz with hairspray.
