 Prepare the cake pan or baking dish by spraying with non-stick cooking spray or lining with parchment paper.
 Use a fork or a vegetable masher.
 Stir through to combine.
 Add the salt. Stir only enough to combine.
, Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips over the top of the batter.
 Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean.
 Let sit in the pan for a few minutes, then turn out onto a wire cool rack to cool completely.
 There is no need to ice this cake; the chocolate chips on the top already serve as a delicious topping.
