 A good place is usually between the player you are manning and the basket.;
, Be ready to move in case he tries to dribble around.
 This is a good mixture of personal protection, and defensive stance. You basically want to trick your man or girl into trying to dribble straight to the basket. If you setup too soon, he/she will just dribble around. Small players tend to dribble around you, so it's best tried on larger opponents.
 Once you've committed to the charge, it's very hard to go back to playing a mobile defense. If you move even to the side, you will probably get called for a blocking foul.
, Don't lean into the player. Don't lean away. Let their shoulder make contact with your arm and fall.
 A no-call is also a win in this situation, as chances are enough contact was made to disrupt the players drive to the basket.
