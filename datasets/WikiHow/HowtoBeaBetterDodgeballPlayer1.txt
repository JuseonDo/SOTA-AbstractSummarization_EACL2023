 This means being tall or having larger hands may benefit your throwing. Upper body strength will also play a role in your ability to throw the dodgeballs.;
, The feet or lower legs is the best spot to aim for getting someone out. Basically the higher you throw the easier someone can catch it subsequently getting you out of the game.
 If you are higher than most people in the game, a good idea would be to stay in the back to avoid the other team throwing to their hit teammates.
 If you can stay in, you owe it to your defensive players to help them out and that means not getting out quickly. Try to use a shield person to help you stay in longer.
 Go for the easy target when you get the ball.
 Try hide it behind your back till an easy throw is available.
