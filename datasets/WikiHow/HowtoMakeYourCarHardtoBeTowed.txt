 This makes one less side that can be accessed to tow your vehicle.;
, This makes it nearly impossible to tow your vehicle from the back end unless it is put on a flat bed tow truck. In this case, it will at least make it more difficult to get onto the bed of the tow truck.
 While this doesn't keep your vehicle from being towed, it will make it more difficult.
, By enabling the 4-wheel-drive system (automatic 4-wheel-drive doesn't count, you have to select a full-time mode), the drivetrain is all locked together, and requires all four wheels to move together. By selecting 4-LO, the low gearing will undoubtedly hold the vehicle where you parked it. Don't forget to disable 4WD when you decide to leave, otherwise damage may occur to the drivetrain when operating 4WD on pavement.
 This makes it almost impossible for your vehicle to be towed.
