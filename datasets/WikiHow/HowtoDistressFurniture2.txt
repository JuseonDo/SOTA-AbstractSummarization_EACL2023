 Start with bare wood.
 Use an item such as the end of a high heel shoe or a hammer with a small chisel to make indentations on various places of the furniture piece. Don't overdo it; the furniture will look tacky if you add too much distressing.
 The paint will need to be stirred frequently to keep it mixed properly.
 Always paint using one complete stroke for each length painted.


Paint the trim first.
Paint a base coat next.
Paint quickly as the milk paint dries quickly.
 Add 100 grit sandpaper to the sander. Locate areas where wear-and-tear would be most likely (corners, bumps, front areas) and sand over these areas.
 Sand over the non-distressed areas with this grade of sandpaper to smooth.
 Place rubber gloves on and old socks over the top. Rub the wax finish over the whole piece of furniture.


Excess wax should be removed immediately; scrub off with a plastic-bristle brush.
