 When you need to make a mouse costume in a hurry, these are a great start.


You can also easily make your own mouse ears headband. Just cut two small (about two inches) rounded ears out of felt or furry fabric (gray, brown, black, or white) and glue them to a plain headband.
You can also glue a pipe cleaner to each ear and attach its ends to the headband for more stability., You can use clothing you already have, or purchase new items.


Women can use things like a tank dress, leggings and a tank top, a solid color dress, or sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
Men can use things like sweatpants and a sweatshirt, or pants and a t-shirt of the same color.
Anyone can also use some black, brown, gray or white footed pajamas as the mouse’s body., Just make sure that the tail is the same color as the clothing you are using for the mouse’s body (or pink).
 Use pink lipstick to draw a dot or triangle on the end of your nose to form the mouse’s nose. Draw a few whiskers on your cheeks using eyeliner (black, brown, or white).
 You can put socks on your feet and socks or mittens on your hands to use as the mouse paws, if you would like. If you are using footed pajamas as your mouse body, you will just need a pair of socks or mittens to put on your hands.
