You can configure stroke settings including position, color, and size.
, Right click on the text layer and choose Rasterize Layer Style


This will flatten all text layer effects (stroke) so we can add another one.
Once you rasterize your text, it will be converted to a vector layer and you will not be able configure text options anymore (font, font size, or text color).
 Do this the same way you added first stroke.
