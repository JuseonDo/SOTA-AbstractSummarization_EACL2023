@summary
this is by far the hardest thing to teach, as some horses get it and others don't.

@summary
train by allowing the horse to turn on the off side hind leg.

@summary
allow 5 to 10 minutes for one turn or pivot, as if you go slow, the horse is less likely to rush and confuse its self.
@article
 The same method applies for backing, but instead of moving entirely back with 4 footfalls, only two are used, and then a degree of turning.
 In showmanship, the horses are placed higher if they pivot this way, however they do not get punished for pivoting on the hind near leg. If they pivot any other way points are taken off the score.
 As you progress, increase the pivot time until you can do it in a click of your fingers.
