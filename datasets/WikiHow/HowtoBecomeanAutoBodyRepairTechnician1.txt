If there is an auto body repair program at a nearby high school (or even a nearby community college), talk to your school’s principal or counselor about attending the program there for school credit.
If you’re trying to get your GED, look for free preparation courses at your local library or community education center.
If you’re studying for any test -- GED, SAT, or ACT -- check out the study guides from your local library. Use them to prepare for your test.;
