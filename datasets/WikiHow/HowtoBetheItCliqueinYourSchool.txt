 Find some talented and gorgeous people in your school to hang with. Make sure they are trustworthy friends. Become close with them and hang out a lot.;
, Tell them about dressing the same and then say that the clique would need a leader and they should vote on it. Every member has to vote and then pick a side leader.
 To help make that more "clique" look, sit together, shop together, walk together, etc.
 In many cliques, there is one leader... YOU! But, you have to work to get there - and stay there. You must always be in the middle when your strut down the hallway. Always have most gossip points, or most gossip. Have the best rating on outfits.
 For example, Massie Block's clique is called The Pretty Committee. other great names are The Cool Crew, The ___ Crew, the It Girls etc.
 Like, I always raise my eyebrow and pucker my lips slightly.
 If you're not a good Alpha, your Beta (2nd hand person) may take your part. If she tries to do this, destroy her.
 You WILL have jealous LBRs want to be a part of you. Be firm, and just tell them flat out "No" and they will eventually go away.
