 Photographs look best when there is some contrast and if the sun is behind you, your image will be very flat.;
, This will bring in shadows and introduce contrast to the shot. In other words, the light needs to be on your right or your left.
 This helps bring scale to the image.
 This will protect it from the sand and will help cut the glare from the harsh sun.
 As everyone knows, the desert is very hot and can also get very cold. Protect your camera from either extreme.
