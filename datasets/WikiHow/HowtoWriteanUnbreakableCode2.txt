 Our message is hello.
 Hello becomes 8 5 12 12 15.
 You only need as many letters as there are in the message. Using our one-time pad, these are abgsd. This is the key.
 The key is now 1 2 7 19 4.
 Add the first letter of the message to the first letter of the key, second to second, etc. Our codetext is 9 7 19 31 19.
 Our codetext becomes 9 7 19 5 19.
 Our codetext message is IGSES.
 This is why it is a one-time pad: each part is used once. If it's written on paper, tear it off and burn it. Our one-time pad is now peycnghf.
