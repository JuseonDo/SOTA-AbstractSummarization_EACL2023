The leftover biscuit dough can be fried and eaten as well. If you don't want to fry them, feel free to throw them out.
 Place the donuts in the oil and fry until golden brown and fluffy. Watch donuts fry when they're in the oil, they cook fast.
 Use tongs to remove the donuts and have them rest on a napkin. Allow to cool.
