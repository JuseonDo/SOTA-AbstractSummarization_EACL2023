 Make sure it is as taut as possible.


Smooth out any wrinkles or creases; any of these left behind will impress on the chocolate.;

Alternatively, use a cool surface such as marble or granite. Just make sure it is clean.
 Take it to the edges.
 It won't take long provided the layer is thin; about a minute or so.
 Once the chocolate has set, lift the plastic gently and start breaking the chocolate into random flake shapes.


If you have used a cold surface such as marble or granite, use a wallpaper scraper to scrape from the edges first into the center (the center dries last).
 The flakes are best used rather than stored; place atop a cake, dessert pie, or other treat for serving.
