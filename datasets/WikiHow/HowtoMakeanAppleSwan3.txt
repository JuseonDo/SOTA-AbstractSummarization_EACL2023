The cut can be about 3/4-inch (1.905 cm)deep., Set two knives next to the other half of your apple and make a full horizontal cut through the bottom of the apple. This should create a thin slice of the apple that you can use for your swans head and resembles a heart., This will start to form the head. Try to visualize what a swan's head looks like, or use reference photos from the web so that you can create the best swan head and neck.
 Finish your swan's head by making one final cut on the side of the apple slice, below the V that you just cut out. You can make other cuts and refine the look of the swan's head as well.

 Take the apple seeds that you set aside and put them into where the eyes should go on your swan's head. Use a butter knife to press them into the pulp of the apple, so they stick., Take the swan head that you created and place it into the rectangular slot that you made earlier. If you're having trouble keeping the swan's head in the notch that you cut out, you may have to cut a little bit deeper to accommodate the size of the neck.
