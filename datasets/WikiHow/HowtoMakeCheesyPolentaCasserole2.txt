 It is important that you preheat the oven before you bake the cheesy polenta casserole. This will ensure the casserole bakes evenly., Place a glass baking dish on the counter and lightly oil it with cooking spray. The baking dish should measure about 8 x 8 inches or 20 x 20 centimeters., Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high. Add the green pepper, green onions, and garlic to the saucepan. Cook for about 3 minutes., After you cook the green onions, green pepper, and garlic in olive oil for 3 minutes, add the marinara to the saucepan. Allow the vegetables to simmer in the sauce for about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir occasionally., Add the fontina and mozzarella cheeses to a medium sized mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to mix the cheeses until they are thoroughly combined., Use the wooden spoon to spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer one third of the sliced polenta on the sauce, and top with about one third of the mozzarella and fontina mixture. Spread a thin layer of sauce on top of the cheese. Repeat the entire process twice, so that you end up with three layers., Once you create three layers of sauce, polenta, and the mozzarella mixture, you will top the final layer of marinara sauce with Parmesan cheese. Use your hands to sprinkle the cheese evenly across the top of the entire casserole., Place the casserole in the preheated oven. Bake the cheesy polenta casserole at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for about 25 minutes. The cheese should be bubbly and golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving.Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
