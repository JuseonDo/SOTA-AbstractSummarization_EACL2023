 A clove hitch may be tied by forming two loops and putting a pole through those two loops. This alternative technique has the limitation of having to be tied at the end of a pole. However, it is quicker to tie than the above method.
 An easy way to remember this is to end the left loop above and right loop down.
, You now have a clove hitch.
