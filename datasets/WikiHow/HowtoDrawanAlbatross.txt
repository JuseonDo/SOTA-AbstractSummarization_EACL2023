 The oval will serve as the bird's body, the circle as its head.;
, Extend them far out and place an angle in the middle of each, so the albatross looks graceful but also clearly in control of its flight. Draw a rectangle and one small circle where the beak will go.
 Try to connect them all smoothly, so the wings start having more natural shape.
 Erase all the rectangles and detail the bird's tail as shown.
 They can range in darkness and length, depending on your preference. Make sure to include an eye and more defined beak on your bird.
 Most albatrosses come in light or not very diverse colors, but make the beak a vibrant yellow and add shadows/highlighting to the feathers if you wish.
