 The meat should be cut into 2-centimetre cubes. Remember that whilst getting rid of any excess fat, leave some connective tissue as this adds to the overall flavour. Sprinkle the meat cubes with seasoned flour.;
, Add a little oil and butter, then lightly sear the meat. You may have to do this in batches.
 Layer the meat, onions, carrots, leeks and potatoes on top.
 Bring it to a simmer. Allow it cook for 2 hours with the lid on.
 Slowly add the suet - do not rub it in. Add some cold water and mix until you get an elastic dough. When you have achieved the right consistency, divide the dough into eight dumplings.
 Strain the liquid into a smaller saucepan to cook the dumplings.
 Cover them and leave them to boil for about 20 to 25 minutes. Do not let them come off the boil.
