;
, They should be about 3 1⁄2 feet (1.1 m) long, or more. Make them longer than you need, but not by too much, as you don't want to waste the string. A good thing to remember is that it's better to have too much string than not enough.









Have some string left over, so that you are able to tie the bracelet around your wrist.
The two strings that you use to tie around are not visible in your bracelet! It's best to make them a different color from the rest, so that you can tell them apart. They also don't need to be as long.
 Put them in the order that you want to tie them in. The two strings that are to be used to tie around need to be next to each other and at one end of the bracelet. In these images, brown is being used as the tie-around strings.
 Tie a basic left or right knot (depending on how you set up your bracelet) on to both of your tie-around strings. Remember that you have to tie it two times for every knot! The string that you just tied with should now be on the other side of the tie-around strings.
 Note: the tie-around strings are the only strings that you are making knots on. You should only be tying two knots per string per wave.
 This means that all of the strings are on the other side.
 Your bracelet should look like the one in this image.
 They should look like this image.
