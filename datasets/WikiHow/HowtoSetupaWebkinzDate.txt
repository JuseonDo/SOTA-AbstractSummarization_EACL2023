 It doesn't matter where the couple comes from, any couple is fine!;
, Simple!

, They could be going to the movies, a restaurant, the park, etc.
 If it's at the movies, pick a movie, and play it on your TV. If it's at the park, take them in your backyard. If it's at a restaurant, prepare them a "meal" in your kitchen.
 Every Webkinz needs to be ready for their date! But make sure they dress right. You don't want a Webkinz wearing a fancy dress to the park!

, Have them go out and make up every moment of their time together!
