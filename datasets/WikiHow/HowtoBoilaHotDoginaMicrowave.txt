 The fork must be long enough that the handle is longer than the hot dog.;
,, It is important that the water be cold (since the hot dog out of the fridge will also be cold) so that it doesn't boil early and not cook the hot dog.
 IMPORTANT: The fork must not be able to come in contact with any part of the microwave or it could spark. If the microwave has a turn table make sure the fork won't contact any part of the microwave while it is turning.


The point of the fork in the hot dog is to hold the hot dogs under the water so that the end of the hot dogs don't get over cooked by being out of the water and getting direct exposure to microwaves (which most hot dogs will do since they will float in the water).
No, putting a metal fork in the microwave will not hurt your microwave. If the fork touches the side of a running microwave it may spark and damage the fork or the metal shell of the microwave, but as long as you prevent this it is perfectly safe.
 Adjust for the strength of your microwave. When the water boils for 20-30 seconds the hot dog is done.



Grasp the fork with a hot pad to take out all the hotdogs.
