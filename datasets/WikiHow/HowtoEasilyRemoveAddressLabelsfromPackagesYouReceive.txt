@summary
buy some nail polish remover, preferably in one of those 'nail polish remover' hand held pens (that way you can apply it easily).

@summary
just rub the nail polish remover across the address label, vigorously.

@summary
this works for nearly every kind of professional address label that is used out there.

@summary
recycle that box in peace!

 Or pour some into one of those plastic bottles used for moistening envelopes (you can find those in most "99 cent" stores). Nail polish remover can be acetone or non-acetone - either will work. Or just pour some on a cotton swab or a napkin.;
, Your name and address simply 'melts' off in seconds. No need to tear or cut the label out; no need to write over it with another pen.
 It even works on black marker writing on boxes.
