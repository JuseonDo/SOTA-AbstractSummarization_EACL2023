 The left needle will have the rest of the stitches. In this tutorial, the stitch just before the yarn over will be called the "first stitch." The stitch after the yarn over will be called the "next stitch."


Pay attention to your stitch pattern. When working the English style, you will need to move the yarn into the correct position. This will depend on what the first stitch was, and what the next stitch will be.;
, Bring the yarn towards you, under the right needle. Next, drape the yarn over the top of the needle, away from you.









This is called a "yarn forward" or "yfwd" in knitting patterns.
 Bring the yarn under the right needle, towards you. Drape the yarn over the top of the right needle, away from you. Next, wrap the yarn under the needle back towards you again.









This is called a "yarn 'round need" or "yrn" in knitting patterns.
 Simply drape the yarn over the top of the right needle as you bring it towards you.









This is called a "yarn over needle" or "yon" in knitting patterns.
 Drape the yarn over the top of the right needle, away from you. Next, wrap the yarn under the right needle, towards you.








This is called a "yarn 'round need" or "yrn" in knitting patterns.
 Stick the right needle through next stitch on the left needle. Wrap the yarn under and over the tip of the right needle. Use the tip of the right needle to pull the yarn back through the stitch. Keep the working yarn on the right needle, and slip the stitch off the left needle.









Some patterns call for you to yarn over twice. Simply wrap the yarn around the right needle like you did previously, then complete the next stitch.
 When you do the next row, you will eventually go over the extra stitch you got from the yarn over. You will get a lace-like hole that also acts as an increase.
