, Some freezers offer the added benefits of freezer locks and temperature alarms. Freezer locks are a good choice if you have young children in your family.
 Think about how often you go food shopping, the size of your family, and how much food you normally purchase on a weekly basis.
 Most of the newer model freezers are energy compliant. Depending on the age of the freezer, if you opt for a used model it may or may not be energy efficient.
 Although they tend to cost more than models lacking this feature, the benefits can be an added plus. Having a frost-free freezer will save you time in not having to defrost it several times during the year in addition to helping to prevent freezer burn, which tends to dry out foods.
 Food stored in upright freezers is easier to access as the space is more organized. Chest freezers are good for storing larger size foods and provide more usable open space for stacking items.
 Check to see if any particular freezers have been recalled or have a high rate of problems and unhappy customers.
 Make a list of the features that you want before you go shopping for a freezer.
 Plan your shopping trip with your list in hand and visit several stores for the best selection.
 Make sure that you get a warranty with your freezer and keep your receipt in case you have any problems after the purchase.
