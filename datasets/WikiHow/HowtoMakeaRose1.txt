 Cut a strip twice as long and twice as wide for a slightly larger flower.


A paper with a different color on the backside will make a multi-colored rose.






A paper with the same color will make a uniform rose.;
, Fold it over so that the fold aligns with the horizontal strip of paper. You will form the center of the rose with this portion.
, Then, wrap it. Repeat, folding down at a 45-degree slant, then wrapping a quarter of the way around the rose.


Each slanted fold and wrap will make a petal.






Pinch the rose at the bottom to keep it tightly wound.
The more attention you give your creases, the tighter the rose will be.
 It will help it remain wrapped. However, donâ€™t stop pinching the bottom., Apply a bead of strong glue to the end of your paper. Insert it into the bottom of the rose under one of the first layers of paper.
 Experiment with origami roses of different sizes.
