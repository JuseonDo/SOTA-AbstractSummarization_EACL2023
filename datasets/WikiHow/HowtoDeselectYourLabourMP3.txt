 This can happen as a result of a local devolution of powers. For example, the number of MPs in Scotland was reduced as a result of the creation of  the Scottish Parliament

, Usually if at least some of the MP's old constituents live in the new constituency boundaries, they can stand. This can result in two current MPs contesting one position.
 If they win, your previous MP will be automatically deselected.
 Usually, new candidates have not been allowed to stand in the circumstance of a boundary change. However, this is not an official rule, so if the labour members in the constituency hate all potential local MPs, it could be a chance to select a totally new candidate.
