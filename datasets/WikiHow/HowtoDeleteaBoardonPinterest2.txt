 The Pinterest app icon resembles a red "P" on a white background--it should be on one of your Android's Home screens (or in the App Drawer).


If you aren't already logged into Pinterest, do so now with your email address and password (or Facebook account).
 It's the person-shaped icon in the top right corner of your screen.,, Doing so will open the "Edit" menu.


You can also tap your board and then tap the pencil-shaped icon on the of the screen to perform this action.
,, Doing this permanently removes the board and all of its contents from your account page.
