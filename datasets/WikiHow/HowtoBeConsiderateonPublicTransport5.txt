 If it's a door, you're inevitably going to be in someone's way and irritate someone. Move to the side if possible; if there's no space, try to accommodate for others and move slightly to the side in the little space you have.
 Too many people on one train can cause injury and crashes. If it's possible, try to catch a later train. It'll be a relief for people who are already stuffed in a crowded train like a sardine in a tin.
 It wastes space, especially when people are going to board the train with luggage and etc.
 If available, go into areas designated for prams/buggies/strollers, etc. or into the wheelchair area (as long as there are no people utilizing that area).
