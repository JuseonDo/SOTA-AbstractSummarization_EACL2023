You can use a straw or two to help you drink the water more quickly.
Make sure that is only water that you are drinking and not alcohol, which can cause hiccups.
 Even if you don’t actually have to cough, just make yourself do it.
 It’s not clear why this technique works, but putting pressure put on a nerve or blood vessel often seems to help.
 To make yourself sneeze, try sniffing a little pepper, breathing in a dusty area, or walking out into bright sunshine.
 All of this together can help end a bout of hiccups.
 However, if you already have them, they may also “shock” your body into ending them.

Sip water (or some other non-alcoholic, non-carbonated beverage) slowly, letting it hit the roof of your mouth., Typically, you can cure hiccups with home remedies. However, if your hiccups last longer than two consecutive days and you've tried treating them at home already, it's time to see your doctor.
