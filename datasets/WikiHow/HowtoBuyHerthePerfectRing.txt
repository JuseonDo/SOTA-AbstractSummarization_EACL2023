@summary
never be afraid to explore her jewelry tastes.

@summary
don't hesitate to go to the mall and randomly walk into the jewelry store.

@summary
if she's showing you things she likes, or researching on things - listen!

@summary
,

@summary
start looking.

@summary
avoid getting anything smaller than 1/4k diamond when you're proposing, even if it's just a starter right and you want to go bigger later because you're broke.

@summary
go to different stores and ask questions.

@summary
figure out what size she is!,

@summary
absorb any hints she provides you with, get what she wants, not what you want.

@summary
remember that shape is important - heart, pear, princess, etc.

@summary
ask her girlfriends and her mom!

@summary

@summary
buy that darn ring, and give it to her!
@article
 Pay attention to what she wears. See if there's a piece of jewelry she wears more than any other piece. Note this away.;
, If she wants to go - go! If she doesn't say anything, just follow around and see what she's peaking at. Ask her what she likes!

,, When you've seen everything you feel you need to know about what she likes, start looking!


Does she like 1 stone, or 3? Does she like big flashy rings, or small dainty ones?
Look for a ring that fits her likes and her personality. If she's uptight and picky, always wants to look good, she wants the bigger stone, possibly with a little extra on the side.
 The average 1/4k solitaire round cut is $350-$400.


Look at the diamond quality - look at the prongs holding the diamond. In a round cut - 6 prongs is best. It supports the diamond better. 4 is average, think about what kind of work she does.
 Tell them what you're looking for, don't go to the first person, shop around.
 Whether you straight up ask her or steal an old ring (sometimes finding an old ring doesn't work....it may be too big, or too small.)

, Money shouldn't be an issue. But if you can't get her exactly what she wants, she should love you for it anyway.
 Get the shape you feel she likes, or fits her. Princess - she's your princess. Heart - show her you love her. Round - it's perfect! (personally I prefer round and no larger than 1/2 kt).
, Hopefully this helps you guys out there trying to decide on how to buy her that ring. Do any and everything possible to get her the right one! Good luck!
