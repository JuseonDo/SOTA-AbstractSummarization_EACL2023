 Fences is not free software, so you need to buy it. You can also opt to download the free trial to experience Fences for a short time.
 Many windows will appear on your desktop.
If you're using the trial, click on Activate 30 days trial and enter your e-mail address and complete the verification process.
 Once you have completed the verification process, a tab will appear asking you if you would like to use the self-programmed fences or create your own fences. Choose the option which suits you.


Customize your Fences. Fences can be named by clicking on the top bar. You can add programs to a fence by dragging and dropping its shortcut into the Fence.
