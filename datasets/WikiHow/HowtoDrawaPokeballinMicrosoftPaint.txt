, Some people may personally prefer to make their own grids, but you can paste one from the Internet if you want. To make a grid, draw a horizontal line in grey/dark-grey, and keep drawing them, making sure the space between the lines are exactly the same, to the top of the document. Then do the same vertically.
, Change the circle-brush to the largest square there is.
 If the squares you drew on the grid were small, one pixel should be a 2x2 square on the grid. If the grid squares are huge, one pixel can just be one square on the grid.
,, Now click on "Attributes" and select "Black and White" on the "Colours" section. Now invert the colours again. Then change the colours to "Colors".
 The squares on the grid look a bit spaced out, don't they? You can join them together to make a complete one or so pixels by selecting the Brush tool and filling in the spaces between the squares.
 Decorate it however you like!
