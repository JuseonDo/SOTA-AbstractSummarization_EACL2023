 Although it's not compulsory it might be a good idea to pray with a Pentecostal as they would hopefully be able to help. Ask God for forgiveness for all of your sins, and study His word (possibly, keep a journal/notebook of your studies). Pentecostals believe that prayer is a person's way to talk to God, and that "rightly dividing" the Word of Truth (The Bible) -- and so, measuring out its meanings correctly, is your final authority for answering all doctrinal questions. Intuition, leadings, callings must align with the scriptures of the Bible.


Say the prayer in Ephesians 1:16-23 for wisdom and revelation for yourself.
, Pentecostals take a great deal of their core beliefs from the book of Acts which depicts the early church as it began from scratch a Jerusalem. The first two chapters of Acts are especially pertinent as that tells of the establishment of the Church upon the day of Pentecost.
 by looking in your phone book. Call the church for service times.
, Pentecostal services are participatory occasions.
, The Holy Spirit was promised by Jesus: He said, "I must go away. If I do not go away the Holy Spirit will not come." He said, "I will send the Holy Spirit that He may comfort and guide you, and He shall be with you forever."

, "Be filled with the Spirit"(Ephesians 5:18)


And the early Church prayed for others to receive the Holy Spirit in Acts 8:15.;
