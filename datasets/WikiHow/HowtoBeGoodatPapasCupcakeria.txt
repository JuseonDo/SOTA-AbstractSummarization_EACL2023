, When the first Closer comes in, don't panic! It is extremely hard to get perfect on a Closer (or anyone, for that matter), so don't get all flustered if you get 50% for something, just relax and have fun.
 If you do them slowly, not only will you lose Waiting Points, but you might not be able to keep on top of it all.
 If you keep on practicing at Papa's Cupcakeria, then you will get higher scores.
