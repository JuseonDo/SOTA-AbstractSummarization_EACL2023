 Although they might be easier to disassemble, the wood is more likely to be damaged beyond use. You can get up to 40 feet (12m) of wood from a good pallet.;
, Shipping pallets are built with annular ring nails, which are meant to stay put.
 A handheld reciprocating saw will reduce pallet deconstruction from 30 minutes or more to about 10 minutes.
 The five-inch (12.7cm) blade that comes with the saw will not work, and you will break the saw if you use it for this project., Make sure it is secure. Plug the saw into an electrical outlet.
 Earplugs or ear protectors will also reduce the risk of hearing loss.
 If you can’t, lay it across sturdy workbenches and you can saw the nails off using a horizontal motion.
 The smaller horizontal slats, usually 2 x 4 wood, should be nailed to these pieces to create the top surface of the pallet. You will need to cut through the nails along the vertical pieces where the horizontal and vertical slats meet.
 Place your saw between the two pieces of wood and cut downward or sideways, away from your body, in a smooth motion. You will cut through the spiral nails that connect the two pieces of wood.,, The horizontal boards may start to fall off. Ask a friend to pile them up if they are becoming a hazard.
 Move around the outer edge, cutting between the wood where the frame pieces meet.
