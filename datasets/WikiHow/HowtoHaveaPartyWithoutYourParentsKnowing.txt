 Find a time when your parents will be gone, and all your siblings and other family members(if you have any) are also gone. Most families have a calendar where they write down events, appointments, etc. Try to find a day and time where the house will be empty. Avoid asking parents directly, because this may sound suspicious. Playing sick can also help you get the house to yourself if the whole family is going somewhere together, but this may backfire! The whole family may have to stay to "take care" of you.;
, If you want a large party, tell the people you invite to "bring their friends". If you want to keep it smaller, tell them so.
 Remove any objects that can be broken and put them in different rooms. If valuables of any kind are laying around, make sure you hide them as well.
, If people are drinking, this will help them not get too clumsy. However, keep your guests away from alcohol.
, Bring out the garbage bags and start dumping out beer cans and other garbage a little by little.
, (Preferably ask them before the party, as a heads up and something to hold them to)

, No matter what, always do it the right after the party or the following day. Never procrastinate on this part.
 Too much trash can signal to what you were doing, either that or if the fridge is too empty.
 Sweep and mop the floor in your house.
,, Examine the area for anything that you may have missed. Taking a photo on a camera/phone will help you fix things you might have missed but your parents would notice, check the photos often throughout clean up.
