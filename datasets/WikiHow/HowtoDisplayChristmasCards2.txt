 The wreath would need to be plain, so that the cards would be the main attraction.



If the wreath is Styrofoam, you can attach the cards with a pin that is inserted into the card and the Styrofoam. If the wreath is covered in material, you can attach the cards with a pin.
If pins will not work for the type of wreath you have, consider attaching the cards with clips or miniature clothespins.
