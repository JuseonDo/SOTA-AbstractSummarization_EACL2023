 Add the clear soda and whisk until the cake mix has completely dissolved in the soda. (You will see a bit of foam in the beginning, but don't worry, this will go away as you continue to whisk).
 Just use the powdered cake mix.
 Make sure you give Bowl 1 the most batter and gradually decrease your batter amount in each consecutive bowl. Bowl 6 should contain the least amount of cake mix.
 Squeeze about a dime (10 pence) sized (0.705 inch or 17.91 mm) amount of one color in Bowl 1. Continue doing this with the other colors for the rest of the bowls. Mix the colors into the cake mix.
 Don't worry about spreading it out.
 Continue doing this with bowls 3 to 6. After you pour in your last bowl, you should see that the cake mix starts to take the shape of the baking pan.
 This will add visual texture to the cut cake.
, If the toothpick comes out clean, then it's finished!

,, If wished, frost the cake. Otherwise, it's fine on its own, as the many colors will make it interesting enough.
