 Choose a pretty jar, as it's on display.
 Keep them near the jar, with a pen.
 Add them to the jar.


Adding a date is optional but may be something you'd like to do.
 On days when you feel bored, nostalgic or need a boost, pull some memories from the jar to remind yourself of the great things you've done and feelings you've experienced in the past.
