, It's important to use the word "favor" because people are more willing to do favors for people they like.
 If you're an escrow officer, it's when they receive their check. If you're a hairdresser, it's immediately after you cut their hair. If you're a plumber, it's after their toilet is repaired, ect.
 Tell them that when they review your business on the Internet, others who are searching for the services you offer will be able to make an informed buying decision based on their comments. Don't assume your customers understand the value of writing a review. You must be explicit.
 If you've ever written a review on Google before, you know it can be done in less than 5 minutes. The easier your customer perceives the task, the more likely they will be to do it for you.
 If a customer is expected to find your business on the Internet, or type in a long link in the address bar from a piece of paper, they will not do it. Put the link in the email and make it super easy for them to do. (Be sure to read the first tip below)

, When a customer knows you'll be looking for their review, they are much, much more likely to write it for you.
