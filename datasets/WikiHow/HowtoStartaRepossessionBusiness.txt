 The repossession business follows strict rules, and you must have a good understanding of the laws that govern this type of business in order to avoid mistakes.


Spend time working as a repossession agent for an established repossession business to learn the trade. In many states and countries, it is a legal requirement to have proven experience in the industry before you may apply for a license to start a repossession business. Even if these licensing requirements don't apply, it's useful to know as much as possible about repossessing before entering the business.
In some locations you have to follow an accredited training course and pass a state exam before you may apply for a license. Contact your local department of transportation to find out which rules apply to you.;
,, You'll need a sum that can cover the cost of operations for the first 6 months.
, You'll need an office space, as well as a secure parking lot or garage to store repossessed vehicles.


Make sure the parking lot or garage has a good security system, preferably with a live guard as well as an armed response team.



Liability insurance protects your business in the event that you're sued.
Property insurance protects your equipment, as well as any stored vehicles, in the event your location is damaged or destroyed due to vandalism, crime, fires, or natural disasters.
 If your start up capital allows, it's best to have at least 3 flat bed trucks with wheel-lifts to avoid damages to the vehicles you repossess.
