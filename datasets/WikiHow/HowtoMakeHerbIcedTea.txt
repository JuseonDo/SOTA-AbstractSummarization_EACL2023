 Generally you use 2 teaspoons dried herbs for 250 ml/8.4 fl oz water and 6 teaspoons fresh herbs.


Choose varieties that you like, such as lavender, spearmint or peppermint. See Tips below for more suggestions.
The leaves should be clean and washed.
To bruise the herb leaves, simply rub between your fingers before using. Only do this just prior to using them, as the oils will start being released as soon as you bruise the leaves.;
,,,, Add additional herbs if the flavor is not strong enough. Refrigerate if desired, to chill even more.
 You can add sugar or honey or rice syrup to your own taste. But it's a good idea to have a few sips first, as you may be pleasantly surprised by the herb's own flavors and feel that there is no need to add sweeteners.


Consider sprinkling in a spice rather than using sugar. It will save you from consuming non-nutritional calories and can make an interesting blend.
