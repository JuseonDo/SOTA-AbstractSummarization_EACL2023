 Unlike flat sheet sarongs, and Indonesian sarong is a tube of patterned fabric.
 Hold the sarong open at your feet. Step into the hole, like you would into a skirt or pair of pants.
 Fold the top down, inside the sarong, until the sarong is short enough for your body. If you are tall, you may not need to do this.
 You want the sarong to be snug across your back, left hip, and tummy.
 Keep your fingers together and your palm flat.
 Keep your left hand on your right hip. This will help create a neat fold.
 Women typically leave the sarong alone after this. Men typically roll the top down 2 to 3 times to extra security.
