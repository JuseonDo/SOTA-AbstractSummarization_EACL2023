@summary
hold the needle with the stitches in your left hand, and hold the needle without stitches in your right hand.

@summary
insert the needle without stitches under the front of the first loop (the one closest to the needle point), and push it through so the right needle sits behind the left needle.

@summary
make sure the working yarn, the yarn attached to your yarn ball, lies in the back of your needles.

@summary
grab the working yarn attached to the yarn ball (not your tail yarn), and wrap it around the right needle counterclockwise, so that it sits in between the two needles.

@summary
look in between your two needles.

@summary
poke the right needle through the left hole to the front of the left needle.

@summary
now that you've got a new stitch, pull off the old stitch.

@summary
repeat the knit stitch until you've knitted every stitch that was on the first needle, and they'll all been transferred to the second needle.

switch the needles.

@summary
knit every row and keep switching needles.

 Consider wrapping some of the working yarn around your right middle finger. This will keep the yarn in the back of your work.
,, Wrap the yarn from back to front.
 You should see two holes created by the middle yarn.









Maneuver the right needle up and down to position it over the left hole.
 Do this slowly, making sure your loop does not slip off the needle.









If you are not looking down at the needles but straight at them, the process will look a bit different. Start pulling the inserted needle out of the loop slowly, making sure that the yarn you just wrapped around it doesn't fall off. It may help to hold that yarn tight so the loop remains snug around the needle.
As the point of the needle is about to pull completely out of the loop, turn the point so that it faces you and takes the yarn that was wrapped around it along.
What you're doing here is pulling a loop through a stitch. The loop you just pulled onto the second needle is a new stitch that will replace the old stitch.
 Hold onto the un-knit stitches on the left needle with your left hand, and bring the right needle and your knit stitch up and off the the tip off the left needle. If you've created a knot on your right needle, you've knit correctly. (If not pull off whatever you've done, cast on another stitch, and try again.)








,, Move the needle in your right hand with all the finished stitches to your left hand, and move the needle in your left hand that is now empty to your right hand. Make sure your loops are all facing the same way, and your knitted work is to the right of your left needle.
 Keep doing this and you'll start creating a "garter stitch" pattern.
