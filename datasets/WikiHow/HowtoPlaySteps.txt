 This player stands by a post or door with his back to the other players.;
,, The counter who is standing by the door counts to 5, slowly or quickly as wished, and then turns around. While he is counting and his back is turned, the other players take as many steps forward as they can without being caught.
 If anyone is moving when the player turns around, they must exchange places with the counter.
 When one player has reached the goal and touched it, he can go back again and begin all over.
 The player who touches the goal the greatest number of times just by stepping, and has not been caught, wins the game.
