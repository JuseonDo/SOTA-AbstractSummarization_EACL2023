 You want to start with a blank 'slate', so it's easier to work with. Put your posters somewhere else like behind your door or closet.;
, You'll work better and faster. And it will create a great environment for your ideas to roam!

, But be careful, not everything works, it has to reflect your personality and hobbies. Search for pictures with you and your friends and family, photos with your pet, anything that reminds you of a beautiful moment of your life (e.g. train tickets or cinema/concert tickets).
 Try printing out art from websites such as Deviantart.
 It's good to first adjust them to the wall to see how they look and then stick them. Be sure you like the way it looks.
 Use blu-tack so you can reposition things as necessary.
 Anything can be used (e.g. birthday cards, real-estate pictures, brochures for a cause you believe in, hairclips or even small gemstones!).
 You can take photos with you and your friends and glue your heads over some celebrities bodies or add funk accessories to your photos, such as pirate hats or glasses.
 It makes the wall look more interesting that way.
, Then, go to a photo development store (the ones that print out your pictures) and they can print out your photos on sturdy glossy paper.
