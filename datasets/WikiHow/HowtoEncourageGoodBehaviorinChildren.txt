, Play games and have fun with them. Do what they like, but in the right way.
 At times you can learn a thing or two, and make them your friend. Make them really happy, in a good way.
 Reward them with healthy food, five dollars, or more computer or tv time. Just don't reward the child too much, they can get fussy sometimes when rewarded a lot. Tell them that a reward comes when doing something right in life.
 If you discipline them, do it, but just have patience. Don't harm them, because their children, and don't know the world yet.
 Tell them the good things that happen when doing good things. They should try to like being good, not doing it for the reward of it.
