, This can also be a sign of weepy eye. It may be hard to tell if you have more than one rabbit living together, because rabbits groom each other. If you separate the rabbits for a short time, this may be easier noticeable., This can be caused by a few things - wrinkles that come with old age, sleep deprivation, or weepy eye. Use process of elimination to find the cause.,, This behavior is a response to discomfort (though it only irritates the eyes further)., If you can figure out what caused your rabbit's weepy eye, you might be able to help the vet (or yourself) in treating it. Weepy eye is caused by a blocked tear duct and/or inflammation of the eyelid, which might be caused by any of the following:

Cellular/bacterial debris clogging the tear duct
Osteoporosis making a tooth root intrude into the skull
Infection in a tooth root or middle/inner ear
Dust, sprays, or fumes
