Tap the "X" button to continue.

You can confirm how much space your card has by accessing the system's browser and selecting the memory card icon.

Make it something memorable in case you have to come back and edit it later. If you don't already have an ISP, the program provides links to different ISP services (such as America Online and Earthlink)., The "Automatic" setting is for ISPs that automatically assign new internet protocol (IP) addresses for different devices on the network.

If you need to manually enter your ISP settings and don't know the particular information that needs to be entered, consult your ISP documentation and your primary computer used to access the Internet.

Enter that information in this portion of the setup to sync it with your PS2 online access., Once setup is complete, you can remove the disc and start a game with network functionality.
