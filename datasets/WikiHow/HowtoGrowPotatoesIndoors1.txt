 The eyes of potatoes are small spots on the skin; this is the part that germinates. One potato with 6 or 7 eyes can yield up to 2 pounds (900 g) of potatoes. If you want to harvest more than that, buy at least 5 seed potatoes.;
, Use a vegetable brush and scrub each potato under running water. This will also remove pesticide residue if you aren't using organic potatoes.
 The mouth of the jar has to be wide enough to support the potato on toothpicks.
 Be careful not to cut through an eye, because that is what will be germinating. You may have to cut large potatoes in quarters so that they can fit over the opening of your jar.
 Place the toothpicks evenly at about halfway between the cut end and the top of the potato.
 Allow the toothpicks to rest on the lip of the jar. Readjust the toothpicks if the potato doesn't rest evenly on the lip of the jar. Make sure the potato's eyes are covered with water, or else they will not sprout.
 A south facing windowsill is perfect. You can also place the jar underneath grow lights.
 Add water if necessary to keep the potatoâ€™s eyes covered.
 Most potatoes take about a week for the sprouts to appear.
