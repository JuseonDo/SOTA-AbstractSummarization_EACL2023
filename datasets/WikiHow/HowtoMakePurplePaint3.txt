 Whether you mixed your purple paint by using red and blue or magenta and cyan, adding white will make it lighter and brighter. Add just a little paint at first, then gradually mix in more to achieve the hue you want. Adding as much white paint as purple will create a pastel color.
 Adding black paint to purple will deepen the color to a rich, dark purple. Add a little at a time to prevent accidentally going too dark; it's hard to pull back with black paint.
 This will create a grayish lavender color, as dark or light as you like.
 Add more blue or cyan to push your purple toward violet.
