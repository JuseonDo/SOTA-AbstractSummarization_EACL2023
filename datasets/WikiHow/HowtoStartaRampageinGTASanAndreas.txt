 You can find them around all San Andreas, purchasing weapons from Ammu-Nation or getting them from gangs and police.;
, Finishing the Vigilante, Burglary and Paramedic side-missions will give you extra armor, health and infinite sprint to help you to escape.
 The highway leading from Los Santos to San Fierro or Doherty Garage is best.
 Just don't get 2 or 3.
 Get your heavy weapon out and shoot at them straight until you get 3 stars.
 When it comes to you, blast out that helicopter with a RPG (if you have one, if not, M4 or Sniper Rifle may best.)

, Now there comes hardest part! SWAT are now coming to blast you out. Use every weapon to blast them out and you will get 5 or 6 stars!

, Now comes very very impossible part: 6 STARS!

, Quickly make an escape to safehouse and save your game!
