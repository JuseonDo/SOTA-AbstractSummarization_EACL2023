 Preheat oven to 450 and locate your food processor, bowl and cheese grater. Spray the baking pan with non-stick cooking spray.
 You will need to steam the cauliflower so either boil chunks in water on the stove or place in a small amount of water in a microwave safe bowl and cook for up to 5 minutes.
 Blend on high until cauliflower forms a mashed potato type consistency.
 low fat mozzarella cheese (grated or chopped), Â½ tsp. onion powder, pinch of salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Add cauliflower and mix well.
 Cover well until the entire pan is filled with the cauliflower mixture.
 Add cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking for added flavor.
 Allow breadsticks to cool slightly before cutting.
