finished.

 Allow for up to 24 hours of dry time before performing the next step.
 The painted side should face outward from the candle (this ensures the writing reads the right way, etc.). Next, wrap a larger piece of wax paper around the tissue paper and candle. Leave excess wax paper to allow you to hold the candle while you transfer the design.
 Heat the candle holding your chosen heat source close over the paper until you see the tissue paper begin to disappear and the wax paper melt. Shift the heat source around the candle to ensure the whole design is covered. The design will be transferred to the candle as the heat is applied.


Hold the heat source away from the hand holding the candle! Beware burning yourself––this part must be done by an adult.
 Go slowly as you don’t want to peel away any of the newly transferred design.
