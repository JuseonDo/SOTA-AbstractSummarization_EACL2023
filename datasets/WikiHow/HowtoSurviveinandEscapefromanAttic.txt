@summary
an attic can be dangerously hot on a summer day, so, take care to stay out of the heat as much as possible while you work on getting out of the attic.

@summary
look around for the attic entrance, typically a small panel or staircase.

@summary
look for a light switch to turn on so you can see what you're doing, and so (particularly at night) others may notice your presence by light escaping from the attic.

tap several times on the beams and the roof to attract attention.

@summary
look for a spot in the ceiling made of soft material only, such as sheet rock (generally the whole ceiling in a house is made of it) or wood strips and plaster.

@summary
alternatively, pop out a vent or grill to admit fresh air and attract attention, or escape through it if you must.

@summary
use a tool to escape if you have it and help is not coming.

Generally, stay low and look for a space fresh air is entering. Often, it enters at the eaves and escapes, hotter, at vents higher up.
Watch where you'd escape to. Don't escape to a long drop to the ground or an interior floor; instead, attract attention and be rescued.;
, Pick up and set aside a loose panel, or swing a door or staircase down.


Until you've tried this, you're just in an attic, not really stuck in an attic.
Some attics may have doors into other rooms, or onto a roof.
,, Use something hard to do the tapping, preferably. Do this every so often.
, Shift insulation out of the way if possible and stomp or otherwise strike it to break it. Hold onto something so you don't fall through before checking what is underneath. This will open a hole to the room underneath. See what is down there before dropping through.


If the attic has a wall leading to an interior top-level room or an entrance to the roof, try to break that as well.



It may be possible to pop out a nailed-on wooden panel. The ones on the ends of a typical roof are probably easier to hit squarely and less securely attached. Do not strike a surface with nails poking through it. Take care not to throw yourself out after the panel.
 If you have a saw, you could even cut a hole (careful, you don't want to be trapped in an attic injured).
