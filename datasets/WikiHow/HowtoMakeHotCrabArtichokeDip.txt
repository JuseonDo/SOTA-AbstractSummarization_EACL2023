, Use your fingers to break the crab meat into pieces. Add and whisk in the chopped artichoke pieces and bell pepper with the crab.
 Use a hand or stand mixer to blend the cream cheese, mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons chives, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt together.
 Avoid whipping the ingredients together, but just to combine, as you still want it more chunky than creamy.
 Bake for 30 minutes.
