@summary
choose your material.

@summary
cut the paper into equal strips, about 1cm each.

@summary
trace your foot on a separate piece of paper.

@summary
cut out your foot tracing.

@summary
,

@summary
on another piece of paper, draw a flip-flop outline around your foot tracing, about how big you would normally want your flip-flops to be.

@summary
take the strips of newspaper and weave them together.

@summary
fold the outermost strip on side a so it is going in the same direction as side b and weave.

@summary
trace the flip-flop shape onto what you have just created.

@summary
cut out "feet" in the shape of your flip-flop out of the newspaper, at least 30.

@summary
create your straps.

@summary
tape the straps together so their ends line up, like attaching a pole to a tree for support, but leaving 1 inch loose.

@summary
,

@summary
create a hole between where your first two toes would be.

@summary
,

@summary
feed the straps through the hole, split them, and tape.

@summary

@summary
tape the other ends on the sides of your feet where you chose them to be.

@summary

@summary
create some 1" by 2" rectangles out of newspaper.

@summary
,

@summary
flip over your very thin flip-flop and tape the rectangles around the edge, sticking out a considerable distance so it looks like a sun.

@summary
place the stack of "feet" on top.

@summary
fold the rectangles around the "feet" and tape.

 It can be anything from newspaper to loose leaf. The only requirement is that it has to be an entire sheet of paper, or ripped/cut into long strips.;
, It is better when they are straight edged, so you could use a ruler and draw the lines or use a paper cutter. (If the page doesn't fit you can always fold it and cut)

, Be sure to hold the pen or pencil straight up and down while tracing or you might end up with a distorted version of your foot. You could also dip your foot in paint and have a footprint on a piece of paper, but that is much messier.
, (About a centimeter is a good distance)

, Take some strips of paper and clip them together with tape or binder clips. This will be side A. Take one strip and weave it through them perpendicularly, going over and under. Take another strip and weave the same way, but going under and over so the first strip is fixed in one place. Continue until the amount of strips on side B is the same as side A.
 Repeat, switching sides every turn. Continue until it is as long as your flip-flop shape.
 Put tape on the lines you drew and cut out.
 (It sounds like a lot but if you fold the newspaper and then cut, it goes a lot faster. They do not have to be perfect, as long as they are not drastically too big) OPTIONAL: Wet them and let them hang to air dry for more comfort.
 Measure the distance between where the strap would hit between your first two toes and where it would hit on the side of your foot. Add about 2 inches. Create a strap the width you would like using the same weaving technique as before. Do the same for the other side.
