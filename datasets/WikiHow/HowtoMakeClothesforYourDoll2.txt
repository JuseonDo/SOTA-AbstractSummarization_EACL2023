 If it stretches to the doll's width, that's great.
 Slip the remaining sock over the doll to test for fit.
 Use a fabric marker or similar to do this. For a shirt, this will be around the waist; longer for the dress.
 Cut along the marked line.


If you are concerned that the sock may unravel, you can hem it. But then it won't be no-sew! You could paint invisible nail polish along the edges to stop fraying.
 Glue on fabric patches, sequins, buttons, a fake pocket, etc.; anything really that will jazz up the outfit. Fabric glitter or fabric paints can produce great effects.
 She's now ready for play again.
