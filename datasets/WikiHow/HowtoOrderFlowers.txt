,,,,,,,,,,,,, If there is a shop locally with whom you would like to establish a relationship, you can call or visit in person. If you are sending flowers further away, you can ask a local shop to send a wire or you can find a florist in that area online and call a 1-800 number to place an order. Most florists have a 1-800 number for just that reason, it will allow you to spend more on the arrangement and not have to pay a wire fee.
 if you send flowers for $40 it is very likely that you will only receive about $35 worth of flowers.
 Tell the florist the occasion, the receiver and what kind of flowers you have in mind, also establish the amount you'd like to pay and ask if this is before or after any other kinds of fees, such as delivery charges.
 At this time, the florist will tell you what kind of arrangement she would make for this, maybe what kinds of flowers are in stock and what the delivery fee would be. If there is something in particular you want included, mention it now. Describe what you have in mind, use words like bold, colorful, monotone, delicate, tropical. Request a color scheme, if it is important. If you are giving an arrangement to an individual, describe what she is like and what kind of person she is. Is she conservative, whimsical or both? What kinds of colors does she like to wear?

, Make sure the order is exactly what you want, the list of charges and confirm payment are what you expect. If you are paying over the phone, you will need a credit card.
