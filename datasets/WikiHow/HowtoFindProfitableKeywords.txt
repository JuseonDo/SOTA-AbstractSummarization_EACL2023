, Go to Google and type in your keyword, you will get a listing of the number of pages for your keyword. To get the number of pages with your exact phrase or word, use quotes e.g. " golf clubs".
 This is really a very powerful tool for keyword research. Type in your search keyword, you will get a list, click on "show estimated cpc" , "show advertisers competition". Now look at the drop down menu, click "approx avg search volume", the keywords are sorted by highest number of searches. Remember the higher the number of searches, the more difficult it will be to rank high on Google, as the market is liable to be saturated.
 Look at the top three sites that come up in Google for your keyword. Google rates each page on a scale 0-10, called page rank, if you find the first page Google results full of page rank 0 , your ranking will be easier.
 If it is not there, the site is perhaps unaware of the keyword, or does not know how to target it. The ideal keywords have sites with low page rank, and are not targeting the keywords.
