 (350F) Prepare the cake tin by either greasing it, or lining it with baking paper.;
, In a small saucepan, add the sugar, cinnamon stick and water. Stir the sugar until it dissolves. Boil until the the mixture turns golden brown. This will take about 10 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and pour the toffee mixture into the base of the cake tin.
 Peel, core and slice the fresh apples. Layer the slices across the toffee base in the cake tin.
 Cream the butter and sugar together. Add the eggs, one at a time and the vanilla.
 Add the milk as you stir; it might not be necessary to use the whole cup, so use your judgment as you stir. Once the mixture is combined well, pour over the apple and toffee base in the cake tin.
, Run a knife around the edge of the tin to move the cake away from the tin. Put a large serving plate over the mouth of the tin and carefully turn over the whole tin. The cake should gently slide onto the plate, with the toffee apple topping facing upwards.
 This goes well with whipped cream and some fresh apple slices.
