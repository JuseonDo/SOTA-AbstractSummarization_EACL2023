 Stir just until the ingredients are combined.
 Mix everything together to form a smooth batter.
 If you want to add chocolate chips, sprinkles, or another mix-in, stir it in now.
 Fill each up about 2/3 full. Leaving extra room at the top of each cup will prevent the cupcakes from rising too high in the cups and spilling over.
 Place them in the oven to bake for 15 to 18 minutes. The cupcakes are done with a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean.
