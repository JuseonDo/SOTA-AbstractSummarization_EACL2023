,,, This is optional.
 When you click the icon and look at their level, kill the ones that are yellow or green. If the number is grey, it is somewhat like a worthless opponent and you get no or little XP and they don't have good drops. If it is red, you have a good chance of dying.
, (When I was level 15, my first dungeon was HARD, so it is recommended to do them at a higher level like 20 or 30)

, The first thing is profession training, especially riding. Professions help you earn money. The second thing is mounts. Mounts are actually one of the reasons I got this game. They can be helpful at a lot of situations. The third thing is class training. It would be lame if you could only use one spell. You won't stand a chance against higher leveled things. Buy EVERY ability your level makes available.
