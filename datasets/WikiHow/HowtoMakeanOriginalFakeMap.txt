 You might say, "I want to erase", but you can't if you follow this! Okay? Good.
 Name the dots. The ones not in a circle are towns and villages, the others are cities.
 A few of them might go through towns or cities. Name the lines. These are rivers. You can make one or multiple gather into a circle (a lake) somewhere on the map.
 These are mountains. Make some more rivers that start in the mountains.
 Name the forest.
 Name your nation or nations and draw and name a star (a capital city). In olden times, borders were natural things like lakes or mountains.
,, Any stray lines or messed-up things can be changed. Name everything that is unnamed, and voila! You have it!
