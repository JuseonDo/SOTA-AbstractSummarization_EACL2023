 With the availability of the whole city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the historic importance of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania a few hours away (2 to 3 hours away, but still drivable), there are a wealth of other options you can attend.
 The address to the Sesame Place is located at 100 Sesame Road, Langhorne, PA 19047 .The cost to park your car at the Sesame Place resort will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).
 The entry plaza has a big "Sesame Place" logo (with Big Bird's face above it)emblazoned on it!

, This park is shaped in the form of a U (containing most of the games and attractions) but also contains a long street down the center that most guests conglomerate on.
 Except for a nice gathering place for characters to meet their fans towards the end of the street furthest inside the park, this has few to no actual attractions that need to be watched/ridden. (Most of the walkway around the U-shaped portion of the park (containing the park attractions) is a one-way so you must be willing to enter one area and walk around while all walking the same direction.)
