position the standing rod vertically.measure 100ml of water into the tin can.put the substance at the base of the standing rod.at 5cm above the substance affix the tin can with a clamp to the rod.affix the thermometer so that it is in the tin can but not touching the bottom base.

experimentation

@summary
measure the temperature of the water and note it in degrees celsius.

calculation

@summary
use the formula q = cp * m * (delta) t to calculate the heat liberated which heats the water.

 To begin setting up your experiment you will first place the rod on your work table.

Measure the mass of the candle and note it in g.
Light the substance.
When the temperature of the water reaches 40 degrees Centigrade, blow out the substance.
Measure the mass of the candle after burning and note it.

The specific heat Cp of water is 4.18 J/g C
Mass of the water is 100g
Delta t is the difference between the initial starting temperature and 40 degrees centigrade.
Subtract the initial temperature of the water from 40 C.
Substitute it into the formula and you will get the answer q in J. Convert into kJ by dividing q by 1000.
Find the amount of substance burned by subtracting the final mass from the initial mass of the substance in g.
Divide q in kJ by the mass of the substance burned.
The answer is the experimental heat of combustion in kJ/g.
