 This will be necessary if you want to shoot arrows at the creeper.
 You should now have a set of bows and arrows. Make at least 12 bows because you may miss or the creeper could be slow to die.
 This will prevent the creeper from blowing up when you are trying to shoot it.
 Hold down on your screen where the creeper is and release your finger after about 5 seconds. Don't worry if you miss, you can collect this afterwards.
 You should maintain your distance throughout the entire session.
 You can now collect the gunpowder it leaves you and any arrows that you have missed the creeper with.
