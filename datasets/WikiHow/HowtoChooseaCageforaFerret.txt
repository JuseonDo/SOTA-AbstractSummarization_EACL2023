 The size of the cage depends on the number of ferrets you plan to own. A single ferret needs a cage that will allow space for one bed, one litter box, a food dish, and room to play. More ferrets will need room for more beds, food dishes, and play space. A good cage should be at least 30 to 60 inches (76 to 91 cm) long, 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) wide and a minimum of 20 inches (51 cm) high.;
, Wire walls allow air to flow through the cage. Ferrets need good ventilation; never house ferrets in aquariums, no matter how big the aquarium is, they are unsanitary and can lead to serious health problems. Aquariums are for fish, not ferrets.
 For ease of cleaning and maintenance.
 Ferrets are very clever and if it is at all possible, they will figure out how to escape. Be careful of spring latches and small gaps. If your ferret tries to squeeze out, he could get stuck and suffocate.
 If the cage you choose has wire floors cover them with a piece of fitted linoleum, which is a breeze to clean.
 Also make sure that you can secure the litter box and food dish to the cage. If they're not secured, they will be tipped over and used as toys.
