,, You don't have to trade 3 items; you can trade 1 or 2 if you wish.


Start off with items not worth much, such as coupons and food- not rare or exclusives. That way, you can see what the person has to offer.
 They will show up on the upper three boxes.



If you do, click the happy face.
If not, click the sad fave.
 If the other person responds with a sad face, drag the item back to your dock and find a different item you are willing to trade.
 When someone offers something of good value, show something slightly higher. When yours is higher than the other person's best offer, decide whether you want to keep your current offer or go back the the slightly less one.
 If the other person does it first, don't be afraid to reject if you think the other person is ripping you off!
