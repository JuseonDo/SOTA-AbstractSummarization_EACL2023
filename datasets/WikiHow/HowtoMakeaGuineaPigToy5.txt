@summary
choose guinea pig safe food, such as carrots (see how to feed a guinea pig for more ideas).

@summary
insert a thread hole into each piece of food.

@summary
thread the food pieces onto a long piece of string.

@summary
hang in place.
@article
 Prepare the food by washing, drying and cutting into small pieces.
 For example, cut small triangles into the carrot pieces, in the center. Aim for the center of each piece of food, as it needs to balance well on the string and also have plenty of edges for the guinea pig to nibble on.
 The string needs to be long enough for you to hang across the guinea pig's cage.
 Let your guinea pig have fun nibbling away at the line of food.
