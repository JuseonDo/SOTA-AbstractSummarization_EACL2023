 You can go with your favorite pony, or another one to do a test-run.;
, Find a plain white baseball cap, a set of clothing paint (colors depending on the color scheme of the pony you have decided on), and a small paint brush.
 Place several paper towels out around with more paper towels under them.
, Lightly sketch the cutie mark of the pony you've chosen in the center of the cap.
 Using the colors of the cutie mark, outline it and fill it in with the paint brush.
, Using the color of the pony's secondary color (their mane), outline and fill in the cap with the paint brush. Let it dry for the same amount of time.
 With the color of the pony's primary color (their coat), carefully paint around the cutie mark and fill out the rest of the cap.
 Once it is done, try it on.
