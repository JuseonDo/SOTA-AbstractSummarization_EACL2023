@summary

place the leaf on a hard surface.

@summary
put a white sheet of paper on the leaf.

@summary
rub a crayon, pastel pencil, colored pencil or marker on its side and gently color on the layered paper over the leaf.

@summary
repeat this craft with other leaves and colors.
@article
 Look at the texture and features on the leaf. Are there holes on it? Has it dropped on the ground recently or has it been on the ground for some time?;
, A good suggestion is to use a notebook or a piece of cardboard. Put the leaf "veins" towards you (the bottom of the leaf).
 To prevent the leaf from moving, you can tape it down on the hard surface., Notice that you'll be "drawing" the leaf on the paper.
 Use soft and hard leaves to compare how drawings come out.
