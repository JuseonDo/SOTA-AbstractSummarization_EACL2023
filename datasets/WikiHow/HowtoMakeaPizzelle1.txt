 Form a well in the center of the dough.
 Add the fresh yeast to dissolve it. Once dissolved, pour into the flour well.,, Knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Use a little more flour if the dough becomes too sticky., Knead each piece into a dough ball., Place the sheet into a warm area to rise for about 1 hour. Ensure that it stays warm. When the balls have doubled in size, they're ready., Pull the ball of dough and flatten into a circle shape about 12.5cm/5" in diameter., Drop in a small cube of bread to test first––if the bread starts to fry, the oil is ready., Until you're more experienced, only fry one ball at a time. Keep an eye on the underside–-when it's golden in color, turn it over and fry the other underside until golden., Keep warm by piling on top of each other., Top with a suitable topping or sauce, such as sugar and cinnamon, chocolate sauce, bruschetta topping, Parmesan cheese, etc.
