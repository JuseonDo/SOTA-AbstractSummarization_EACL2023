 You can make the colors match, use contrasting colors, or use a rainbow of colors.


Choose small and strong colored rubber bands. If the rubber bands are too big, they will sag and look odd.
 Slide the rubber band in the clip opening, then pull to one end.
 You've now formed the first part.
 Continue in this way until the necklace reaches the desired length.
 Your rubber band and paper clip necklace is now ready for wearing out.
