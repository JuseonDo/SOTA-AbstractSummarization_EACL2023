@article
 It is highly preferable that the mixing "can" be very cold. The can should be kept in the freezer until needed (not the motor or hand crank, of course);
, Snap/jazz (snazz) it up with your extra/optional ingredients if desired: such as some chopped walnuts/pecans or coconut, and/or pieces of maraschino cherries -- chosen to your taste, as desired.
 Chill for about half an hour or so. Chilled ingredients plus chilling the mix helps you to speed up the ice cream freezing really consistently/evenly.



Pour in the chilled ice cream mix.
Assemble churn and start: the hand cranking/or electric motor.
 The ice cream may be quite soft, if you like that. Keep churning for a firmer texture, for 35 to 45 minutes.



Or, instantly put it in a container and in your refrigerator-freezer, or as quickly as possible.
