 Fight off one druid, slough, and specimen wolf. A pop-up will tell you to find a dispersal.;
, Say, "Hello there! I like you. Let's play! Let's start a pack!" You name it, and boom, you have a mate!

, It's snowing!

, See all the green things? Pick one, and run to it. Choose it. You now have a den! Mark it with P. It will now say you have pups!

, Howl. Step. Howl. Step. When the blue bar is full, you did it!

, Don't panic. Catch up to it and bite it 3 times. Eat. Run to the pups. Wait for a coyote. Kill it. Repeat until it tells you to feed pups.
 You must feed them until it has a big pop-up. Select "stay at den." Eat until your bar is full.
 Select start journey.
 Save, exit, and come back in. You just used eagle spray!

, Your mate will carry them. Head towards the "u" shape in the creek. Cross with pups in mouth there, one at a time. Howl a lot; your mate may drop them in the creek.
 When your pups and mate and you are there, howl. Take a screenshot, and reload from the last save. Press m. Choose a place to go. Take the pups there, and live there.
