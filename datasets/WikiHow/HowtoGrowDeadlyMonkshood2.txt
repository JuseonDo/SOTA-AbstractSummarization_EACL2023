 Water monkshood plants as often as necessary to keep the soil moist throughout the growing season.This will most likely be once a week, depending on the climate you live in.
 This will help to help keep the soil cool and moist.
 When organic matter has been added to the soil, there is no need to give monkshood any fertilizer.


If organic matter is not added to the soil prior to planting, give your monkshood all-purpose 10-10-10 fertilizer in the spring as soon as they begin to grow. Sprinkle the fertilizer around the plants, not on them, and water it into the soil.
 Deadheading means removing the dead flower stalks as the flowers fade or after they are killed off by a hard frost.


When you deadhead flowers, it allows the plant to put its energy towards growing new blooms.
