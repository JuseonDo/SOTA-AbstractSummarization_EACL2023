 Baking soda is a great way to remove bad odors and build up in your kitchen drain. It is a great way to clean out the drain.
 White vinegar is also a great way to deodorize the kitchen drain. Pour white distilled vinegar into a pot and bring it to a boil.
 Combining hot vinegar with baking soda will help to clean the drain and remove any bad smells. Carefully pour the hot vinegar down the drain. It may start to fizzle or foam as it mixes with the baking soda.
 This will give the baking soda and the vinegar time to deodorize and clean the drain., Once the mixture has sat for one hour in the drain, use hot boiling water to flush the drain. This will remove any remaining scum or debris in the drain and rinse it out.








To prevent a smelly drain, you can deodorize it with baking soda and hot vinegar on a weekly basis.
