 It's a real turn off for most.;
,,, Don't even say that you would be cruel to animals.
 So if your Pisces does something which bothers you, like sending 10 emails in a week to show you that he or she cares, it's okay to speak to him or her about it. Just mind your words.
 Even if it's just an email every other day. Pisces doesn't need to be romanced in a big way. Small, tiny ways are often perfect. If you can do little thoughtful things for your Pisces, you'll score big time. But don't over-indulge your Pisces. Make them learn that just because you don't call every day, it doesn't mean you don't love them.
 Pisces are the type where if you break a promise they will never forget it and they will lose trust in you.
 Pisces just can't help it but they can change if you tell them. Again, be tactful with your words.
 Seek ways to reciprocate. They would appreciate you for it.
 That would make them feel more loved. But of course, don't go all fatal attraction on them and kill a bunny. For emphasis again, only SOME Pisces would love that.
 They are unworldly, and it will get you nowhere with them.
 When Pisces are being used or taken for granted they normally don't speak up immediately. They normally deal with it, but when it gets out of control they become very outspoken.
 If you want someone who is sensitive, compassionate, loving, interesting and a long term relationship then a Pisces is the one for you.
, Depending on the type of Pisces the relationship with another Pisces can be bad because it could be like having a clone. Most of the time this isn't the case. Most of the time Pisces are great together.
