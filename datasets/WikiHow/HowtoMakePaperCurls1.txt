 For example, a pencil will make small curls, while a kitchen roll will make much larger curls. It all depends on what use you need to make of the resulting curls.;
, Cut it as long as you like; for example, if it's for a long-haired wig, the curls will be much longer than curls for gift wrapping on top of a present.
 Wrap it just like a barbers pole.
 Spray until all of the paper is coated.
, Then remove the paper curl from the freezer.
,, You now have your first paper curl. Repeat for as many as you need.
