 Blend 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and 1 package of softened cream cheese together until the mixture is smooth.;
, Use a fork to fold 1 drained can of spinach into the mixture until the spinach mixes well with the other ingredients.
 Add 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice, 1 tsp. of salt, and 1 tsp. of black pepper into the mixture.
 This will make the mixture extra smooth. If you don't want it to be extra smooth and would prefer it to be a bit chunky, then you can skip this step.
 Serve this tasty creamy spinach dip with carrots, celery, bread, or chips.
