 It may seem like it is not necessary, but having your closest friends together may help you feel less self-conscious about your singing voice, and help you open up your heart.;
, It should be a large room, free of clutter and debris. A window is nice to have also. It allows sunshine into the room, and a cool breeze if it is let open. No special equipment is required, just a yoga mat, blanket, or towel to practice poses on. (If you use a blanket or towel, be sure to duct tape it to the floor). Flowers are a cheery, added bonus to any atmosphere. Also, if you live in an area where the weather allows it, yoga can be fun in an open yard or field. (Just don't disturb the neighbors!)

, These should be songs about joy, peace, happiness, and the inner soul. A few recommendations are "Cherokee Dream" by Joy Frailey, "Song of Joy" by Heath Ledger, "War No More Trouble" by U2, "Endless Song of Happiness" by Yael Naim, "A New Soul" by Yael Naim, "Reflection" by Christina Aguilera, and "Song of the Soul" by Cris Williamson.
 Simply do your poses as normal, but keep your ears wide open to the sounds and joy of the music.
 You will not sing every line right, but don't worry. You will get it soon enough.
 You may sing better than any American Idol star, but don't think about the notes. You may have to practice this, especially if you are used to singing in public or have had singing lessons. When you are alone, turn on a slow song you know and sing it all the way through without pushing with your diaphragm, trying to hit notes, or even give your voice a melodious sound. You may have to do this several times, but it is crucial to reaching inner happiness in yoga.
, Feel them, and let yourself float away.
