 The interior diameter should be 100 mm or more and the length should be 200 mm with a bottom. Don't forget to put another piece of pipe beneath the bottom and cut a fuel chops entry in the bottom section, crenelating the top accordingly. The pipe should be at least twice as tall as wide.;
, It should be 10mm thick if ceramic. Iron 3 mm should be fine as is. Make sure to leave a hole in the top for oxygen to pass through the crenelates and mix with the gas.,, It should fit your diameters as well as your pushing needs. Pushing needs are dictated by chops size, which you get with a branch shredder.
 It is similar to working pottery, but with larger dimensions. Use plywood wall jigs to help get proper work done.
 Ask a good welder to weld the water boiler in no rust steel, with threaded fittings exit curves already welded on in position.
 When your parts are finished and dry, bake the ceramic parts to refractory, or pay somebody with a ceramic burning oven to do it for you.
, Chop the branches, cereal leftovers, dry food, or anything that is natural and burns and feed your stove.,, Do not use petrol, because this will cause an explosion. Instead use something like cooking oil, and wait until the heat acts on the wood beneath and starts gasification. Enjoy a much hotter and longer lasting fire than conventional wood-burning stoves.
