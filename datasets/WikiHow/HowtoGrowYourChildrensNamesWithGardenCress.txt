 If the soil is weedy or hard, weed it and dampen it first.


If the children are old enough, have them perform this step.;
, There should be little depressions where you have drawn the names in the soil. Again, children can be involved in this step with great ease.
 Keep watering as the cress pops up. It won't take very long before the cress shoots up. If your children are very young, show them how to use a watering can so that it just "sprinkles".
 Most children will become excited and amazed to see their names growing over time.


Take digital photos of the process of the names as they grow; send to grandparents and others with an interest in your children's activities. The photos serve as a nice reminder in later years too, showing children their earlier attachment to gardening.
 Cut some of the cress for the children and put it on a plate.
 Prepare the cress in sandwiches, salads or just as a snack on its own.


Show children how to prepare freshly harvested cress by washing and drying first, then using for food.
