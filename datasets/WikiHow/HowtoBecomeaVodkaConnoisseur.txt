 You can find websites or other resources that contain information to help narrow down which types of vodka you may like the best.;
, After purchase, place your vodka bottle(s) in the freezer. Also, purchase a 3-5 oz glass and place it in the freezer. Prepare an assortment of food that will complement the type of vodka drink chosen. Vodka is best complemented with starchy, salty foods and fish.
 Fill each glass about halfway and hold until the frost is gone from the glass. Warm vodka has a very overpowering taste, while frozen vodka has almost no taste at all. This allows the drink to warm up just enough to enjoy the flavors.
 The better quality your vodka is the more viscous it should be when frozen. Different brands of vodka have unique “glows” of color that emanate from them.
 Inhale while holding the sip to gain an even stronger sensation of flavor.
 Finish the remainder of your drink in a single sip, but this time allow it to pass straight into your thoughts. Compare the experiences with the different methods of drinking with your friends.
