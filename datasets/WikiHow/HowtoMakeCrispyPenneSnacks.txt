 Remove pasta from water by pouring through a strainer and allow pasta to drain.;
, You will end up tossing the pasta with your fingers so you want the pasta to be at room temperature (so you don’t get burned).
 You want to completely coat each noodle but don’t saturate the pieces.


As you pour the oil, toss the pasta with clean hands (or tongs).
 Evenly disburse salt and pepper throughout the dish, making sure each piece of pasta has enough salt and pepper.
 Spread pasta on the sheet so no pieces are covering each other.
 Just a light coating will do the trick and will crisp nicely.
 Since oven times may vary, check on the past after its been baking for 6 or 7 minutes to ensure no pieces are burning.
