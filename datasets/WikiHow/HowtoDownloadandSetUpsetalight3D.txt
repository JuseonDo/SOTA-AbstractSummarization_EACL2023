 If you are a beginner, the most basic version will work. A professional might like all of the advantages that the set.a.light 3D Studio can offer.;
,, If not, start out with whatever size seems appropriate for your uses. You have small, medium, and large to choose from.


For the purposes of this article, a small room will be used.
 One of the first things that you will want to do is go to the Settings option.
 Right now, set.a.light 3D comes in three languages.
 Your options are Metric or Imperial.
 You will definitely want to have the laser pointer, however, because that will tell you where the lighting is pointed at, exactly.
 How you set these will depend upon your machine. The higher the resolution of whatever you are choosing, while you will get a better idea of the final product, it will certainly slow down your computer. Experiment and determine what is best for your purposes.
 If you don't know what your camera is, then do a quick search on the internet to determine your crop factor. Search for something like, for example, Nikon D3100 crop factor.
 You will see options like 3:2, 5:4, etc. A good one to start with is the 3:2 option.
 You want to use the lens that matches what you are shooting with.
