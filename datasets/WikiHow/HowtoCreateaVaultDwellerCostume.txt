 There's lots of ways to form the base of the suit. The best methods are using a pair of crisp jeans and a jean jacket or a blue jumpsuit.;
, Get some bright yellow clothing paint. Form two parallel vertical lines starting at the waist. Paint them up to the collar of the suit, then around the neck. Let it dry after (preferred 72 hours).
 Using the same clothing paint, paint on the number of the vault of your choosing on the back.


Before painting, make sure you have the correct proportions in mind. Stencil it on beforehand if necessary.
 Once it is done, get ready to find accessories.
,,, Some good ideas would be scrapped shoulder pads, knee guards, arm braces, etc.
 You can make a replica (there are tutorials online), or buy one online.


Alternatively, the Fallout 4 Pip-Boy Edition comes with a genuine Pip-Boy.
