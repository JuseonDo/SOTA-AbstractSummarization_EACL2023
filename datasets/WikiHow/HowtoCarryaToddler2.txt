, Two common positions are for you to be on your knees, or squatting with your hands on your knees. Be sure that you're steady enough so that you won't fall when they grab on to you.
, Some smaller children may need your help with this. Put your hands behind their knees and guide them into position.
 This helps support them. You may find it comfortable to lock your hands together in front of you.


If you were supporting yourself with your hands on your knees, do this after standing up.
 If the child begins to slip, put them back on the ledge to try again.
, You may have to focus more on keeping your balance, especially if the child is heavy.
