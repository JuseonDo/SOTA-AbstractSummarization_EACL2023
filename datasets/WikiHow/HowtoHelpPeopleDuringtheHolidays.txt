 We don't really pay attention to the signs reading, "Will work for food!" How about making a little difference in a struggling person's life?;
, When you stop at that stoplight where the person is standing, climb out and give them the basket with a "Merry Christmas!" Seeing them smile back will make your day. And you can look forward to the thought that their life will be that much better. Spread the Christmas spirit around!

There are many families who are struggling with the economic crisis, have single parents, or one parent who is in prison. You can help by joining a charity (as mentioned below) or going to areas where people have less. You can pass out gifts for their children, from something small like an action figure, to something bigger. It will be sure to put a smile on their faces. You will know that you are brightening up lives.



Try giving the mailman a letter. You can wish him/her a merry Christmas and thank them for their service to the community.



You can also make a day in the heat of Iraq more Christmas-like for someone. There are many organizations where you can join and write soldiers letters of encouragement and hope. It will be sure to put a smile on their faces. :)

The Make a Wish foundation helps grant wishes to terminally ill children. You can help by donating. Also, you could bring a gift and visit sick kids in the hospital. You could sing a song, bring some friends to help put on a silly play, or give them a gift and cookies. This will be sure to make them feel better!

,


You can make a difference by donating to Toys for Tots or foundations that help children who have been abused. You can give money to the organization or help and visit the children, giving them gifts and a smile. It's a great feeling to help out!

,


Visit a nursing home to sing carols to the elderly. You can sit and play a game of checkers after as well! Even bring some cookies to munch on together. It'll make their day.



Offer to be a volunteer driver for a day. After, when the person get out of the car and thanks you, hand them a plate of cookies and wish them the best of Christmas. They'll be recommending you for sure!

,


Pay for the toll for the person behind you, even pay for more than one, after all, it's only a dollar! Organize a food drive. Spread gifts to neighbors and friends. Pay for a random person's meal across the room. Smile and wave a people driving by. Put Christmas cards on windshields. Help out the homeless by treating them to a meal with you. Buy someone something nice and surprise them with it today!

, Give a waiter an extra tip, with a happy holidays scribbled on the check!
