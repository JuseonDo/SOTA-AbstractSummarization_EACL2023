 See how their shapes are often nebulous and defined by the surrounding environment. Therefore, it doesn't really make sense to draw the shape of a lake.;
, Feel free to sketch these boundaries in pencil as a guide.
 Is it huddled amongst a forest of trees, or is it part of a marsh teeming with wildlife? Draw in the surrounding environment, as appropriate.
 Draw a series of curved lines that start near one circular point and fan out towards the outside. One group of these blades represents one water plant, but the boundaries between each plant are often unclear, as they grow over each other.
 Start with this basic type or the the bonsai.
 Birds (flying or stationery), frogs, bugs and insects are all great additions to make a lake scene lively.
 If it's a sunrise or sunset, fill the sky with beautiful oranges, yellows, pinks, purples and reds. If it's the middle of the day, go with a crisp blue day with clouds.
 Make sure the sky you picked and the surroundings are hazily reflected in the lake's waters. Reflections should be fainter and fuzzier than the actual thing, so use lighter strokes and pay less attention to detail for this part.
