@summary
bend the long side of the steel wire on the damper segment into a u-turn so that the backwards-facing part is twice as long as the forward facing part (see picture).

@summary
make a small loop at the end of the damper wire, and tie some thin string to it.

@summary
run the thin string down through the loop attached to the brick.

@summary
test your damper; it should rotate from open to closed to open again when you pull the string.
@article
 Place a small nut at the bend, and use a twist-tie to hold it in place. Test the damper; the weight of the nut should make it rotate open. If the damper catches when rotating, you will want to use it on the side with the least snags and resistance when operating the fireplace.
 Make another length of steel wire into a little pulley loop that is anchored beneath the brick or concrete block base. Create a similar assembly with a bigger, flatter loop to hold a clothespin. (See picture)

, Cut the string so that there is about two inches extra beyond the clothespin.
 Practice opening and closing it, using the clothespin to clamp the string and hold it in position.
