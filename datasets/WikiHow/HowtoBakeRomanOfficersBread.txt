 Add the amount of fresh yeast (or instant yeast) suitable for 250 g flour. Dissolve this together with add two heaped teaspoons full of sugar (the original sweetener was honey, as sugar was unknown in Roman times).
 You can use a kneading hook, preferably with a kitchen mixing machine, for about five minutes. Or, this can be done by hand.
