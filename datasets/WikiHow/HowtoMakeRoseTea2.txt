 If you are not buying dried rose petals from a tea store, make your own. You will need to be certain that the variety of rose petals you grow are sweet tasting rather than bitter. If unsure, ask your local horticultural specialists for advice.


Pick the rose petals and make sure they are free of dew.
Half fill the net bag and close with an elastic.
Hang the bag in a warm, dry and dark place to dry. This will take anywhere from a few days to a week, depending on the humidity of your environment.
 Once the petals have dried, you can prepare the tea. Combine equal parts rose leaves and equal parts green powder tea.
, Add honey to sweeten if desired.
