, Allow enough room for you to open the door without forcing your dog to move. This is very important.
 Your dog will likely get up and try to charge through it. When this happens quickly shut the door and wait till the dog sits down. It is best to ignore your dog at this time. If the dog takes too long to sit you can gently encourage the dog to sit the first few times.
 Slowly open the door. If the dog raises from the sit again close the door quickly.
