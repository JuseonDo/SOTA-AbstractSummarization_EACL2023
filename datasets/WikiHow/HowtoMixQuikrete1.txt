 Even if you are very careful, there is still a chance that some dust might get onto your skin. Concrete is caustic, and it can burn your skin.;
, You can make the hole using a shovel or a hoe. This will make mixing the concrete easier.


If you decide to mix in a mortar tub, bring the tub as close as possible to where you will be spreading the concrete. This way, you won't have to transport as much.
 You will need 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of water for every 80 pounds (36.3 kilos) of Quikrete concrete. At this point, you can also stir in some liquid cement coloring.
 Do not add all of the water yet. It is better to add in the water a little bit at a time.
 Brace your knee or foot against the side of the mixing container and place the blade of the hoe into the concrete. Drag the hoe towards you. The concrete will part, and the water will rush in. Keep dragging the hoe through the concrete, from top to bottom until everything is mixed., Keep adding water and mixing until you have used up all your water, and everything is evenly mixed together.
 Grab a small amount of the Quikrete mix using your gloved hand and squeeze lightly. The concrete should feel like wet oatmeal and hold its shape when you squeeze it.
