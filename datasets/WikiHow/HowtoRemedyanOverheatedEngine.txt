 Turn on you hazard lights, put your car in neutral (manual) or park (automatic) and apply the parking brake. Turn off the air conditioning if it is being used. Leave the engine running.;
, If there is steam or engine coolant boiling over, stop the engine and wait until it subsides before proceeding.
 Check again if there is any coolant or steam coming out of your radiator or reservoir. Stop the engine if there is, and wait until it subsides.
 It is located directly behind the radiator, and is used to bring air through the radiator to cool the water when there is insufficient natural air flow. If the fan is not operating, stop the engine.
 The main belt (usually closest to the engine) drives the water pump and the alternator/generator. If the belt is loose or broken, the water pump will not operate and cooling water is not being pumped through the system. If this is the case, stop the engine immediately and call a mechanic.
 Also check under your vehicle for obvious leaks. Note that if you were using the air conditioning, it is normal for water to be draining from the air conditioning unit. If coolant is leaking, stop the engine and call a mechanic.
 If it is dry, or low, add fresh water to it while the engine is running. Fill it to about half full.
 Continue adding water to the reservoir if necessary until the gauge indicates normal (about half-way between hot and cold). Top the reservoir up to half full.
 Take your vehicle to a mechanic as soon as possible to have your coolant system checked.
