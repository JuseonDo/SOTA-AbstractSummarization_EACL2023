 You want to get quick revive as soon as you spawn for if you get down, you won't die.
 You want 5200 points for you can open all doors in your way. Knife as much as you can., If the Mystery Box is up there get it, if not, wait until you get to the stage., It might not seem good at first, but it is fully-automatic after you pack-a-punch it., It makes it a lot more difficult. You want to wait a couple rounds., You want 14,400 points. If you want to take less time doing it, you can save up 7500. After you get pack-a-punch save up 6900 for you can get Mystery Box twice, Speed Cola, and Double Tap., If you don't know what that means, it means run slowly, but fast enough to not take damage, and gather all the zombies in that round. Once you do so, go for the headshots. Not only does it kill them faster but it also gives you more points., It will get extremely hard. If the mystery box is out there, make sure that you are ready to take the risk and HAVE A DECENT GUN!! If you do take the risk, be prepared., If you don't have monkey bombs, you will want these., By now, you should have enough points to get pack-a-punch again., There is NO point of playing a video game, such as this one, without having fun.
