 A basic boating safety tip for all water sports is to make sure there is a designated spotter to help alert the driver to your position at all times and keep an eye out for other approaching boats or objects in the water.;
, Before you go out on the water for the first time, one of the most basic wakeboarding tips to remember is to decide which foot you want to face forward. The foot you choose should be the foot you always intuitively place forward, whether it’s because you’re about to kick a ball or you’re regaining your balance.
 Another helpful beginner wakeboarding tip is to use a shorter rope that makes it easier for beginners to get up and out of the water. Our recommended length is somewhere between 30 and 50 feet.
 Using a beginner wakeboarding stance will make the board easier to control and navigate. The easiest stance for beginner wakeboarding is to place the back binding far back towards the end of the board and align it at zero degrees, so that the rider’s weight is able to press directly on top of the rear fin. The front binding should be at about a 15-27 degree angle, slightly pointed towards the front of the wakeboard.
, The front edge of the wakeboard should be perpendicular to the rope and just above the surface of the water. Your knees should be between your elbows.
