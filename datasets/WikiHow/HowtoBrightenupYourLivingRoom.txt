 It's a major change, but it's a certain way to give new attention to an old, boring room.

, Buy them so that they match the color scheme in your living room.
 Purchase silk flowers that are realistic and match the vibe of the room. You can get these from most places. They don't need watering and they look nice.
,, You would be surprised how pretty that some [candles and candle holders are. Why do you need to buy boring, plain, simple candles? To add an extra touch of luxury, buy scented candles.
