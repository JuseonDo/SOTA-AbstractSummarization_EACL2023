@summary
collect old magazines you're willing to take pages out of.

@summary

@summary
fold all the magazine pieces long ways to form evenly sized strips.

@summary
,

@summary
tape five strips together horizontally, as shown here.

@summary
,

@summary
weave six strips vertically through the horizontal piece you made in the previous step.

@summary
check for evenness and make any adjustments needed.

@summary
place a piece of cardboard the same size as the woven magazine side onto the "back" of the woven piece.

@summary
carefully, so as not to create bubbles, bumps or unevenness, tape clear tape over the entire front of the woven piece.

@summary
cut a magazine piece to the size of the cardboard piece.

@summary
decide on the bag's final shape.

@summary
when you have made all the sides, assemble your bag.

@summary
finished.

 Choose your favorites, as you'll want a decent selection of images and colors.;
, Since the bag has five sides (bottom, right, left, front, and back) you'll need 55 pages in total.
,, As you weave, switch from under, over, under, over, to over, under, over, under, for every strip of magazine.
 It should end up looking similar to the outcome shown in this image.
 You can use the back of and old spiral notebook, inserts from calendars, or just cut a shape to size from a used cereal box.
 Then, tape the ends that overlap the cardboard to the back of the cardboard.
 Tape it on the back to cover up the taped edges and the cardboard itself. It's recommended that you add clear tape to this side too, just to strengthen it and to prevent it from being torn when objects are slipped inside the bag.
 When you've finished one piece, as outlined in the preceding steps, you can decide if you want to make your bag square or rectangular.


If you want it square then make four more side pieces following the same steps.
If you want it rectangular then make one more side following the same steps and three sides following the same steps but in steps instead of the five and six pieces outlined above, make five and nine or eight and nine pieces.
 Just use clear duct tape to tape the entire bag together.


If you intend carrying this rather than using it for storage purposes, consider adding handles. For handles, use anything scrap such as ribbon, plaited twine, a strap off a broken bag, etc. The handle can be attached by stapling, tying, punching in metallic rings and then attaching, etc. Choose the method that works best for your needs.
