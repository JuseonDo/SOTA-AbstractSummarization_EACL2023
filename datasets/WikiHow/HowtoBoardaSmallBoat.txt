@summary
prefer boarding across a solid platform if possible.

@summary
hold on.

@summary
keep your balance.

@summary
once in the boat, always remain in the centre line to move around it and lower yourself to a crouch level so that you reduce your centre of gravity and keep the craft as still as possible.

@summary
keep the craft steady as others board.

 Always board as near to the middle of the boat as possible.;
, If you are crossing using a platform, hold on to the rails provided. If you are getting onto the boat off a jetty or via wading, hold on to the boat itself.
 Avoid plonking one leg in the boat and leaving one on the jetty - this will cause wobbling and you might fall into the water. Equally, do not jump into the boat as this will risk tipping the craft and pushing you out. Instead, use steady movements and be concise.
 Be seated as soon as practicable.
 If you can, steady the boat by holding onto the jetty or sitting in the middle and not moving. Give others a hand to steady them as they get in so that there is minimal rocking. If you are the lucky last who has to wade the boat out and hop in, hold the boat as you stand in the water while others get in. When you hop in, have them steady the boat and give you a hand up.
