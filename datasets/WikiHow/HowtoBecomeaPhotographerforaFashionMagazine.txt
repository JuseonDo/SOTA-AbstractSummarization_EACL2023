 To be a fashion photographer, you will need expertise in photography, particularly in the latest medium- and large-format cameras. Knowledge of studio lighting is also a must.;
, Know your magazines, websites, models, designers, latest trends, and even the history of fashion. The more you can talk knowledgeably about your passion, the more infectious it will be. Plus, the more detailed your knowledge of the industry is, the more you will be able cook up ways to find inroads into it.
 The more you connect with people in your field, the more ideas you will get. You may also find yourself partnering with fellow photographers on collaborative projects. One thing always leads to another.
 Become a known quantity, so to speak, in the world you are targeting. Perhaps your cousin knows a buyer for Bloomingdale's, for example. Maybe a friend of a friend knows the friend of a model for Tom Ford (or Tom Ford himself!). Follow the lead, no matter how indirect it may be. Networking is key.
 You never know who will be the next rising star. Do not shy away from working for some people for free. This will allow you to develop your portfolio and support another emerging artist. Perhaps you will reach to fame together! Leave no stone unturned.
 If necessary, consult with experts in your field on how to make your photo portfolio as professional as possible.
