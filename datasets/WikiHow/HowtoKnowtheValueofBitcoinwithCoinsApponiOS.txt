 The default currency for conversion of the app is PHP or Philippine Peso, so just tap the “Convert” button on the middle of the screen. The app will display the corresponding amount in PHP for the bitcoin amount you input.
 There’s no need for a manual trigger or update of the bitcoin exchange rates for all the foreign currencies. The app automatically gets and uses the updated exchange rates in the background.
 Tap the dollar value on the screen, and a list of foreign currencies will appear.
 Swipe up or down through the list and find the new currency you want to use for conversion. Tap on it when you find it.
 The amount in the selected currency of the bitcoin value you input from Step 2 of Part 1 will be displayed.
 Tap the BTC value on the screen. The field for the BTC will be shown. Tap on it and input the new bitcoin amount you want to convert.
 Tap the “Done” button on the upper right corner of the screen. The app will display the corresponding amount in the currency currently selected.
 If you’d like to convert this new bitcoin value to another currency, repeat Part 4.


You can only convert the bitcoin value to another currency. This app was made just for that. You can’t convert one foreign currency to another as this isn’t a foreign exchange tool.
