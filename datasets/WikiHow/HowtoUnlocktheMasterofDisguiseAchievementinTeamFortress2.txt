 Although either will suffice, Player matches do not record your rankings, so any failed attempts will not go against your name. Of course, Team Fortress 2 is an online, multiplayer game, so your Xbox LIVE membership will need to be activated first.;
, This is the only character you can play as to get the achievement. Try practicing using your spy before attempting this achievement in order to perfect your skill.
 This may take several attempts, which will only get harder to pull off if you're uncovered to be a spy several times, so be patient and skillful in your attempts. The trick is to look natural and not panic.
 Make sure you don't put yourself at risk of being uncovered by calling out for a medic - remember, it'll only get harder to unlock the achievement if you are uncovered.
 You don't even have to have taken damage. Only a small amount of healing is required for you to unlock the achievement. You may dispose of the medic as you wish after you are done with him.
