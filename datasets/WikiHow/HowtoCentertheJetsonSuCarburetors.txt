,,, Screw the nut up as far as it will go and push up the jet as far as it will go. You are now ready to center the jet., Notice that it will fit by rotating it 180 degrees. The cap will also fit on either carburetor. If you get them mixed up, this will also be a factor in whether the piston rides freely. That is if they were centered correctly before you pulled your carbs apart., Screw it down tight. Place the piston in its keyed passageway. Check to see if it is sliding freely and drops with the ‘click’., Seat it and press down on the top of the cap. Lift the piston and drop it. Click? Probably not. You can rotate the cap and the jet or try the other cap till you get the click. Start tightening down the mixture assembly 13/16’ locking nut along with the piston cap screws, continuously checking for the almighty click. Thoroughly cleaning carbs and shining the inside of the piston cap will do you no harm., Again, check for the click., You are now ready to begin setting up your carbs.
