 Make sure that the initial shape will fit in the jar that you've chosen.


The jar should be wide-mouthed and of a decent but not too large a size for the this project. It should also be well-cleaned before using it, so that there is no residue to interfere with the crystal forming process.;
,,, Stir until the borax completely dissolves.
 Tie on firmly

,, Cradle the pencil across the open mouth of the jar. The pipe cleaner should hang above the bottom of the jar, if not, adjust so that it does.
 Check now and then, as you can watch the crystals grow.
 Carefully pull the initial back up, taking care not to knock any of the crystal formation that has grown.
 You can hang it on your lamp, so that when you switch it on, the crystal initial shines brighter, or you can see it glow in the night.
