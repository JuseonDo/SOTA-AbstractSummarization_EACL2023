@summary
but there is an exception.
@article
 For example: I have eaten.;
,


For example: Io ho mangiato (I have eaten)

,


ARE - cantare (to sing) - cantato
ERE - credere (to believe) - creduto
IRE - dormire (to sleep) - dormito

,, These can be called 'Past participle agreement'.


I.e., when 'essere' (to be) is used the past participle agrees with the subject, both in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine).
For example: Gloria è andata in discoteca sabato sera. (Gloria went to the disco Saturday evening)
In the above example since Gloria is female, the past participle 'andare' becomes 'andata'. If it had been a male then it would have been 'andato'.
Another example: Siamo tornati dalle vacanze da poco e ora non abbiamo voglia di lavorare. (We returned from vacation recently and now we don't want to work)
In the above example since the past participle 'tornare' is in the plural form.
When 'avere' is used there is usually no need for past participle agreement.
For example: Cinzia ha ordinato una birra gelata. (Cinzia has ordered a really cold beer)
When past participle follows a direct object pronoun the agreement is optional.
For example: Vi hanno sentito/ti cantare giovedi sera a teatro. (They heard you sing at the theatre on Thursday evening)

, When the pronouns lo, la, l', li, and le, are used with 'avere', then the agreement is necessary.
