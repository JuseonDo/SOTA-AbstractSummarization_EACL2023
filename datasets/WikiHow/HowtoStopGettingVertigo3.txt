 Home remedies involving magnets are based on fads, not science. That may change in future, as early research has found that patients with vertigo react differently to the strong magnets in an MRI machine.This has not been developed into a treatment, or even a solid idea for one.
 Swimmer's ear is a type of infection, usually treated with an antibiotic. Only take swimmer's ear medication if you have multiple symptoms of swimmer's ear, not just vertigo.
