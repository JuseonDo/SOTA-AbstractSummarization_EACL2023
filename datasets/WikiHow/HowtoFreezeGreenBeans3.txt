 Take them out of the freezer bag and place them in a bowl. Use a wooden spoon to separate beans that have clumped together.
 Allow the oil to heat up.
 Stir them around using a wooden spoon until they are evenly coated in oil. They will start to thaw and release water. Cook the green beans until the water has evaporated.
 Add other seasonings like garlic, fresh ginger, lemon zest and red pepper flakes for extra flavor.
 Remove them from heat before they get limp.
 Serve hot as a side dish, or place over spinach and other salad greens for a great textural contrast.
