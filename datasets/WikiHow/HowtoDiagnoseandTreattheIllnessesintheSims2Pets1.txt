 Drag the hairbrush up and down the pet with your stylus, until the all of the 5 stars at the top of the screen (underneath the giant outline of a flea) have turned yellow. If the pet has fleas a message will come up saying so.
 So say, if I bought some flea shampoo from bone cheap and used it on a dog it would still cure it in 3 days. The same goes for all the medicines., First wet the pet by dragging the shower hose up and down the pet with your stylus until the green light shows. Then shampoo it until the green light shows again. Continue by showering it again to get rid of the shampoo until the light appears and finally drying it with the hair-dryer. Then a message will come saying you've treated the fleas for today but you'll need to do it again tomorrow. Do this once a day, everyday for 3 days until the pet is cured., 5 days should be enough.
