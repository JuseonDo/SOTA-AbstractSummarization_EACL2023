@summary
select the kerfing method when the inside of the bend will not be visible and when the bent plywood will not be subjected to substantial force.

@summary
consider steaming the plywood to bend it when both sides of the bend will be visible.

@summary
consider laminating and bending several thin pieces of plywood when strength of the final piece is a primary consideration.

This is a quick and easy method of bending plywood.
This method is only appropriate when the concave (or inner) surface of the bend is either not visible or is subsequently laminated.
Kerfing weakens the plywood and should only be used where the bent surface of the plywood will not be supporting weight. For instance, kerfing is not an appropriate method for bending plywood to make a skateboard ramp.;

Steaming produces a finished piece that is stronger than one produced with kerf cuts.
This method requires the construction of a steam box and a form. It will also take more time to complete than kerfing and requires care to avoid burns.



Like steaming, laminating several thin pieces of plywood together requires the construction of a form. It also takes more time than kerfing and requires more equipment, but it will produce the strongest result.
