 A good resource for this would be the PDGA (Professional Disc Golf Association) website. Look under membership / classification. The key here is to look and see where you may rate. A recreational player will make 30% - 50% of 20 feet (6.1 m) putts, and drive 150 to 300 feet (45.7 to 91.4 m). An intermediate player will make 50%-70% of 20 feet (6.1 m) putts, and drive 200 to 350 feet (61.0 to 106.7 m).;
, Perhaps you have an underpowered 150 foot (45.7 m) drive. This is a significant disadvantage over an average player who will launch the disc 250 feet (76.2 m). If this is you - focus on improving the distance of your drive. If you can drive over 200 feet (61.0 m) - then you need to become an expert putter.
 It is the single best area to focus on to take strokes off of your game. To determine what the impact could be on you game - do some tracking.
 When you record your stroke count, put beside it the number of feet to pin you were away when for the stroke before you made it in the basket. So, unless you make a deuce or an ace, every hole should have a distance in which you missed what could have lowered your score by 1 stroke.
 Do you have any at all below 20 feet? This you can correct in a week or two of practice. What about below 30 feet? A good player will make over 70% of putts below 30 feet (9.1 m). Are you really good?

, Make yourself go out to a vacant field or soccer field, and practice 100 drives. Before going - go to You Tube and check out the instructional help videos created by Discraft. (search for disc golf)

, Use rocks or discs or minis to mark the distances. If you feel really brave, take a hoe and some bricks and install permanent markers.
