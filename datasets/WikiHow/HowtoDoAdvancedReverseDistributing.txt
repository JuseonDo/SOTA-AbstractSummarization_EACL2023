format the equation.

@summary
find the set of numbers that when added will equal the coefficient of the x term, and when multiplied will equal the number term.

@summary
set up the expression with the (x + ?,

@summary
find the opposite form of each number term.
@article
 One side should have the x raised to the second power, the x term, and the number term. The other side should be zero.;
,


Sometimes one or both of the numbers will be negatives. If the x term's coefficient is a negative while the number term is positive, both numbers you're solving for are negative. However, if the coefficient of x is positive and the number term is negative, one of the numbers will be positive, the other negative.
)(x + ?) format.
 If one (or both) number is negative, switch it to a positive. If one (or both) number is negative, switch it to a positive. These two number terms will be the answers to the problem.
