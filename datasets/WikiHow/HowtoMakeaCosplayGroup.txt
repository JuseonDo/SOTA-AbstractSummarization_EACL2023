 Try something catchy, and possibly from a popular anime, like Uzumaki Pro. Doing this will probably get you more members who recognize the title you chose.;
, Doing this may get you more members over the Internet, and club members will be able to communicate easily.
 This is the point of the club! Buying them online is very expensive, so you could always try sewing them by hand or with a sewing machine.
 Who knows, the funny version of Hare Hare Yukai you and your friends filmed may become viral!

,, This is also a great way to buy new things that are hand-made by anime fans. check for your local anime conventions

, Don't just make your goal something easy, but try something challenging such as "We will make a website by the end of the year."
