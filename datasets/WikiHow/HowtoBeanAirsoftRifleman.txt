 Never waste your money on a spring rifle and hold off on starting with a sniper rifle. Trustworthy companies for beginners (and also for most airsofters) include CYMA, G&G, JG, G&P, and VFC. An M4 or an M16 variant will most likely treat you best.;
, In other words if the property doesn't have paintball insurance you should not be playing there. Often local groups and organizations exist in your state. Its these groups of people you want to play with.
 Many organizations and Airsoft fields require full seal but even if shooting glasses are an option NEVER use them. Always wear full seal ANSI rated goggles. Options include, Bolle tactical, Revision eyewear, and others as well as Save Phace and other paintball masks. Gear is much less important. When you first start just jeans and a sweatshirt will do you just fine. As you play more you can pick up gear and camouflage as needed.
 Always have the muzzle in a safe direction, know your target and beyond, keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire, safety can and do fail, and do not point the weapon at something you do not intend to shoot.
 Keep your goggles in a case or a provided bag so they don't get scratched. This is very important not only for safety reasons, but for cleaning as well. If cleaned after each use the rifle will last you much longer.
 Avoid BBs you may find at stores like Walmart of Big 5, such as Crosman BBs. The best brands are Excel, G&G, Goldenball, and KSC. For weight, use no less than 0.20g. 0.25g is recommended for most AEGs.
