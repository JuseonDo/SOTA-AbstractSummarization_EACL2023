 To make delicate paper flowers that look similar to carnations, you need just a few simple supplies:









3 sheets of tissue paper in the same color
A pair of scissors
A ruler and a pencil
A pipe cleaner
Clear tape
Florist tape;
, Use the scissors to cut a rectangle measuring 12 inches (30.48 cm) long and 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide from the tissue.
 First draw a line with a ruler and pencil, a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) from the bottom of your tissue paper rectangle. Draw a diagonal line from the top corner on 1 side that connects to the first line.
 The smaller piece of tissue paper is excess and can be discarded.
 Cut straight lines from the top of the diagonal. The cuts should stop at the pencil line drawn straight across the tissue paper.
 Tape the top of the pipe cleaner along the short side of the tissue paper using tape.
, Use clear tape to prevent it showing.
, This will finish the carnation.
