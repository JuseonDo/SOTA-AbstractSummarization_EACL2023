 In the United States, this means getting the airframe and power plant certificates, or the A&P license as it is commonly called.;
, This means working on the various systems of the aircraft and not just one area. Aircraft mechanic schools typically last 2 years or so. Military members who maintained aircraft in the service can use that towards the 30 months of required experience. Keep in mind that not all MOS's count towards both airframe and power plant.
 The tests are broken down into 3 tests and 3 sections to each test. General, airframe and power plant. Each one of those sections have a written, oral and practical test. To pass, one must get at least 70% in each section.
