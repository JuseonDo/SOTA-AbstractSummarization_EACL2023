 You can create your own hand signs, but it's better to use American or International Sign Language when training deaf dogs. Understanding one of those commonly used sign languages benefits your dog because many veterinarians, groomers and shelter employees also use them.;
, A deaf dog won't hear the command, but he'll respond better because your facial expressions and body language will be congruent, more natural and expressive.
 Withhold those rewards when your dog does something you don't want repeated.


Make the hand signal for "yes" and give a reward immediately. Keep repeating this until your dog understands the link between "yes" and the reward. Use the "yes" sign and rewards to teach your dog additional hand signals and to reinforce good behaviors.
Give a reward and the "yes" sign when you catch your dog naturally performing any desired behavior, such as sitting. When you believe your dog is poised to sit down, make the hand signal for "sit" just prior to him sitting. Reinforce his action with a reward and the "yes" sign.
 Teach him signals for common objects, such as "toy," and for daily activities, such as "walk."

, Keep the sessions fun for both you and your dog.
