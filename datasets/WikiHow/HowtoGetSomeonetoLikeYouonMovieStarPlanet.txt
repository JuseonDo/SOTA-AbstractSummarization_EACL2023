, Go ahead and do that.
, It makes you bond closer together and you get to know more about him as you talk.
 It helps your bond and he might give you a compliment.
 I'll give you an example near the end.
 Just say I understand and stay friends. You can still crush on him and maybe later on, he'll ask you.



"Hey i have been wanting to ask you something for a while now...and I just wanted to say if you don't feel the same way I understand as long as we can still be friends.. But in a way, I just feel attracted to you like a magnet is pulling me toward your direction.Every time I see you, a smile grows on my face. So, this is why i'm asking. I can't bare holding my heart locked inside.I need to set it free but there is nowhere i can. So i am asking, will you please set my heart free? Or in other words, i love you"- That would be good for a guy and a girl if you're trying to woo them. Just be yourself and say whatever you would like as long as it's not "Yo you're hot"
