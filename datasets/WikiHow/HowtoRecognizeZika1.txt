 Zika symptoms are often mild and they only last for around a few days to one week. Symptoms of the Zika infection may include:Fever
Nausea and/or vomiting
Headache
Muscle and joint pain
Red eyes (conjunctivitis) and/or pain behind the eyes
A rash;
,, The Zika virus is transmitted by a bite from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is the same type of mosquito that can also carry Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever.The time-frame for developing symptoms is usually three to 12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.If you develop symptoms of Zika, they will occur within this time-frame. However, keep in mind that a lack of symptoms does not mean that you do not have Zika.
 The only sure way to determine if you have Zika is to have a blood test. Zika has symptoms that are similar to dengue fever and chikungunya, so even a doctor cannot diagnose you without performing a blood test.
