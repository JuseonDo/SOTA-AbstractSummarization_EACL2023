 You can get one at a photography store or you can create one on your computer. Even if your printer isn't calibrated just right, your results will still be better than without using a gray card. You can make one by:Open up your graphic software and creating an image.






Fill the image with black.






Reduce the opacity by 50%. This will give you that 18% gray.






Print it out.

If taking portraits, have your subject hold the gray card by their face (assuming you will be photographing their face).
 Set your software to adjust exposure according to that gray card image.
