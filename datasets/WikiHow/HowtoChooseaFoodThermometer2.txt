 Simply insert a metal probe into your meat and leave it there while cooking. A digital display outside the oven conveys the temperature, by way of a thin cord or via Bluetooth.A good choice for this is the Chef's Digital Leave-In Meat Thermometer for $39.99 (from Oxo).
 One is wand with a bulb at the end. The other is a hinged, folding probe. The second design is a bit more expensive, but offers a more sophisticated probe with faster results.A great choice for a hinged instant-read digital thermometer is the Lavatools Thermowand for $28 (on Amazon).
 Different types of meat thermometers will offer additional features. Generally, the more features a thermometer has, the more expensive it will be. So consider whether or not any of these following features will be useful to you:Audible alarm/alert (that tells you when meat is ready).
Auto shut-off (to conserve battery when not in use).
Pre-set meat temperature (according to USDA guidelines).
Programmable timer (that you can set manually).
Back-light (this enables you to see the display in dark rooms or outdoors at night).
