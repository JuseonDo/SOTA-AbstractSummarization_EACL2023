 The loop or shank on the back of the button needs to be big enough for one of the prongs on the bobby pin to slide through., Wearing the bumpy side against your head will give you a better grip, but you can wear the bobby pin with the bumpy side facing out., Make sure that the top of the button is facing you., Do not let the button settle into the curve. You want it to be facing up, and resting against the flat/bumpy side of the bobby pin.
 This will keep the button from wobbling around too much. Simply put a line of glue along the bobby pin where the button will cover it. Then, press the button down, and wait for the glue to set.If the button is hallow, add a drop or two of glue into the loop/shank part of the button instead.
 If you used hot glue, your bobby pin will be ready to wear as soon as the glue sets; this usually only takes a few minutes. If you used super glue, this may take a little bit longer.
