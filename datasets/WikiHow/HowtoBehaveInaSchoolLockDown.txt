, Student lies may cause other schools in the area to go into severe lockdown.
 Whether it's putting a chair against the door or using a key. Make sure you can still escape quickly in case there is a fire or other dangerous situation in the area where you are locked down.
 The principal will usually say which one it is. In a soft lockdown, you can continue your classroom activity, but you keep the door locked and should not leave the room. In a hard lockdown you must do any thing to make it look like nobody is inside, most of which are included in this article. A soft lockdown is sometimes called a lockout.
 Turn off lights. This way, it will make the room seem empty from the outside.
 Cupboards, windowless rooms, and cubicles are all good places.
 Make sure it's not an office or off-limits room.
 Don't make any noise at all.
 Try not to laugh, cough, or sneeze.
 Do not open the door for anyone.
, Do not cry and do not trust anyone you don't know (except police, fire-fighters, detectives or anyone else in authority. You are expected to follow their orders without question, even if it may appear to increase the danger you face).
 The offender could possibly sabotage the wireless communications between cellphones and read messages and other data being sent and received. This could result in the offender finding out where you are. It can also worry other friends and family members to know you are in a lockdown. Text them after the threat is over, and say you are okay.
 It was probably set off by the offender to trick you into coming out of hiding. If you smell smoke, or there is a real fire, then it may be necessary to evacuate. Your teacher or principal will tell you what to do in the event of a real fire.
 This code will be different from school to school. Do not come out of hiding if the all clear message is incorrect. This could mean that the offender could be making your principal or administrator say it to trick you into coming out of hiding.
