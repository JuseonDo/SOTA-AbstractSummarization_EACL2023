@summary
remove metallic confetti stains on cement, varnished wood and other tough floors by rubbing them with a wet cloth and strong dish soap.

 Alternatively, use an old unwanted toothbrush to scrub the stain with.


Never rub or scrub carpet surfaces. These will need to be treated for dye removal, especially with respect to paper confetti.
If raw wood is stained, treat with care. Dyes tend to stay put.
Fabric may need professional cleaning treatment (soft furnishings and clothing).
