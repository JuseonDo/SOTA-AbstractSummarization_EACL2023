 Protect surfaces from sticky hot glue or work in an area that can be exposed to hot glue.
 Without tying or gluing into place, position the pots around the wreath until you like the design.
 Thread the twine through the pre-drilled hole at the bottom of each pot and tie to the wreath, knotting the twine behind the wreath.
 Simply slide the hot glue nozzle underneath the pot and add a few drops of glue. Hold in place until dry.
 If items you chose are heavy you may want to tie them into place with twine too.
