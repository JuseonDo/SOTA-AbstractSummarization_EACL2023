 If you do your studying time at like 1 am. You will fall asleep!;
, iPhone, laptop, tablet, iPad Air,etc)

, Don't just look at a half page of notes, look at all of the pages of notes

, Just say "I'm doing my homework. Please wait a second." Do it politely if you do it cocky then they won't leave you alone.
 If you get too confused, you won't remember them.
, Pace yourself on the subjects. Ex.) Do math for 10 minutes, Do science for 15 minutes)

, If you're at home and it's noisy. Go to a library, outside if its warm, or go to your room with your door shut, etc

, If you don't understand it. Then you won't understand anything from the test! It's best to ask a teacher the day before the test. If you ask the day of the test. They might not give you the solution. If you didn't ask your teacher, ask your mom. When she has time, If she's busy, don't bug her!

, If you don't, your brain won't function right.
 Ex.) fruit salad, cereal,pancakes,etc)

, Like on the bus, the car on the way there, or even at homeroom before you get to that subject. If the subject is after lunch then eat your lunch then study outside or in the bathroom

, If you don't get one, then just skip to the other one. Then come back to it.,
