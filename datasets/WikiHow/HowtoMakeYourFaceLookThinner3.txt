 Some soft fringes and lines around the face can frame your face and make it look thinner.
 The length will make your face appear longer; it will also add natural movement to your hair.
 When getting a short haircut, such as a bob, avoid cutting your hair the same length all around. Instead, consider cutting your hair shorter in the back and leaving it longer in the front. You will still feel as though you have short hair, but the longer strands will frame your face and make it appear thinner., While curly hair can make your face appear thinner, bushy hair can actually make your head (an thus your face) appear wider than it actually is.
 Having bangs that are cut straight across will make your face appear shorter and rounder.Instead, consider making your bangs slightly wispy, and longer on the sides. They will frame your face more and make it appear slimmer., Have a stylist trim your hair short on the sides and leave the hair on the top of your head longer. This will make your face appear longer and not as wide.
