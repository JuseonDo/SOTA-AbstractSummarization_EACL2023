 Azureus only uses 1 port (unlike some other BitTorrent clients) and the default BitTorrent ports (6881-6889) may be blocked by your ISP. Open Azureus, click View > Config > Server and change the number before Incoming TCP listen port. Choose any number between 49152 and 65535. If you use a firewall you will have to add this port for forwarding to your computer's IP address.
 Try download 0 (i.e. maximum) and upload between 10-25. Adjust downward if you find it is slowing your web browsing.
