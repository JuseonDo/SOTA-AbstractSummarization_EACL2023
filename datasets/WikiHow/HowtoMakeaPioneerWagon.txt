, Keep the half with the top point, and paint it brown. Set it aside to dry.
 You can also cut small circles from black or brown construction paper and glue them to the outside of the caps.
 Glue or tape it over the hole you cut in the milk carton to make the cover for your wagon.
 Glue the wheels into place! If you are using the bottle or milk caps they will be heavy and you will have to work to find a good position to lay your wagon until the wheels dry. You will want most of each wheel attached to the wagon body with very little hanging over the bottom edge. Enjoy your pioneer wagon.
