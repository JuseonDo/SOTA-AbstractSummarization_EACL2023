 Preheat your oven to 200°C or 400°F, gas mark 6.;
, Place a pan of water on a high heat and add 200g of chicken. Boil for about 15 minutes until cooked all the way through.
 Tear it into small pieces that you will be able to fold into your dough.
, If the dough is too thick, add a little more chicken stock or water and stir again. If it is too sticky, add some more flour.
 Roll out the dough to the thickness you desire and cut out as many biscuits as you can, being careful not to waste too much of the dough. It's up to you how big or small you make the treats. Larger dogs prefer bigger, thicker biscuits with a more satisfying crunch, whereas smaller dogs won't be able to fit their jaws around big biscuits. Make the biscuits whatever size and shape is best for your dog.
 Grease a baking tray with a little butter or line with parchment paper. Lay the biscuits on the tray and place in the oven which has been preheated at 200°C for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.
 Remove the treats from the oven and allow them to cool at room temperature.
