,,,, To do this, just follow the texture of the rings and pull them into little segments (the rings are often clumped together and will need a bit of effort to pull apart). Add these bits to the bowl as you tear them off. Be aware that this is the time-consuming part of the process, as it can take 20 minutes if done by yourself. It might be a good idea to get a helper here.
 Break up any sticky clumps of raisins.
 The trail mix should be stored like any dry product. Put it in whatever container(s) it will keep dry in. When you go hiking, trekking, boating, etc., add to small sealable bags for ease of use.
