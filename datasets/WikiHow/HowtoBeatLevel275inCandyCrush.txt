 The bomb dispensers will release eight-move time bombs, which will require you to clear the bombs using moves you could have otherwise used to clear jellies.;
, When matched with one another, the jelly fish will swim on-screen, and break select jellies at random, or turn select candies into striped candies., Special candy combos such as color bomb + striped can clear the meringues too early in the game, and result in the release of timed bombs that may prevent you from passing level 275 in 45 moves or fewer.
 Vertical striped candies will help clear the candies and jellies from these columns without clearing the corner meringues blocking the bomb dispensers.Create vertical striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, while moving the fourth candy into the match in an upward or downward vertical direction.
 Keeping the bomb dispensers blocked will allow you to use more moves to clear jellies, instead of forcing you to use moves on clearing time bombs.
