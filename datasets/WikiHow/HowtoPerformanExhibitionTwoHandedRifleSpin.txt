ask for help when you need it.

@summary
learn the left-hand spin first, and efficiently perform it numerous times.

@summary
learn how to hang on to and balance the rifle while it is spinning.

@summary
learn how to bring the rifle around your back and back to port arms.

@summary
okay, so now that you have learned the left-handed spin and can do it efficiently, it is time to learn how to two-handed spin.

@summary
,

@summary
before you begin, do a few left-handed spins first to prepare yourself.

@summary
when you do the left-handed spin that you are ready to start the two-handed spin on, the rifle should be in your left hand in the position where your fingers are facing up (the trigger of the rifle should also be facing up.),

@summary
take your right hand and place it next to your left hand closer the the barrel of the rifle.

@summary
you will be using your right hand to push the rifle off and back into your left hand.

 That is what every Team Captain is told and taught to do. Don't be afraid to say you don't understand anything and need help. Otherwise, you will never accomplish anything in your program!;
, The ONLY way you will learn how to spin a rifle with both hands is if you learn how to do it with one hand first. The left-hand spin is a very easy move to become efficient in, and shouldn't take more than one or two weeks to get the hand of.
 This is essential! No control or balance of a rifle will cause you to eventually drop it, which Drill Inspectors count off major points for at Drill Meets.
 This is in case you screw up with the rifle but don't drop it.
, And remember, control the rifle. Don't let it slip out of your hands!

, You should be holding the rifle about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2Â cm) from the trigger (not towards the butt of the rifle, towards the barrel!) Hold it here until you are ready to try the next step.
 Don't put your hands too close (as in make sure they aren't touching), they should be just a few centimeters away from each other.
 When you are in the position stated above, release your left hand and use your right hand to push the rifle off. Toss it a bit high so you can catch it in your left hand. You will catch it like you catch a left-handed spin (with the trigger of the rifle facing down), and ready to spin it again in the same manner shown above. Congratulations! You have just performed one of the most difficult and good-looking moves in Armed Exhibition. With time, you will master it well.
