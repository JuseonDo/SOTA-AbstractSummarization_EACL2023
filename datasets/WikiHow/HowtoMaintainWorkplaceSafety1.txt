 Post the plan and map for employees to read. Do occasional fire drills with all employees.;
, Flammable trash includes cooking grease or other oils, paper, wood and any other items that burn easily.
 Flammable materials add to a building's fire load -- the combustible parts of a building.
 Clearing the area below ceilings also allows an automatic sprinkling system to douse flames.
 Check the light bulbs in the Exit signs to make sure they work. Test the emergency lighting system regularly.


Instruct employees and customers not to block emergency access to the building by parking in the fire lane.
 Repair or replace damaged cords. Compromised electrical cords are a common cause of fires in the workplace.


Label all circuits in the circuit box or electrical panel. Employees will be able to shut off power in targeted parts of the building if a fire starts.
 Follow county or city codes on fire extinguisher maintenance and have extinguishers tested and certified according to the laws in your area. Keep fire extinguishers clear of obstructions.


Notify employees of the location of all fire extinguishers. Train employees how to use extinguishers.
 In a temporary situation, an extension cord may be used.
