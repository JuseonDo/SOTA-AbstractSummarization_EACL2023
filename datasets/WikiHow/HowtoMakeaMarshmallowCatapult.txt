@article
 Join the ends with one of the large marshmallows to design a large triangle.;
, With the triangle laying on a flat surface, build a pyramid above the triangle.<

, Tape the plastic spoon handle to the end of another skewer. Wrap the tape around the spoon several times to secure tightly (this spoon will see a lot of action).
 Lay the rubber band over the marshmallow that has topped the pyramid. Allow the band to just lay there.
 Pierce the end of it on the marshmallow at the base.
 Hold the base as you pull the spoon back gently against the tension of the band.
