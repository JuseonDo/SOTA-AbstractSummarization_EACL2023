 The pickup bed cover comes pre-assembled so there is no drilling. Just place the folded up cover on your truck's rails behind the cab and center it there.
 Keep it a little loose at this time, to allow easy adjusting later. Now do the other side the same way., Now you can unfold the cover entirely., Again, do not tighten too much, to allow for adjustment., Make certain the cover is sitting properly on all sides. You should be able to push on the cover to center and align it with the clamps just snugged., Make sure to do this before opening the cover entirely. You will understand this better by watching the video below. Open the cover completely and tighten the front clamps., Make the necessary adjustments to the rear clamps to hold the cover securely. Your cover is now ready to use.
