From the home screen, Go to Settings > Kinect.
Select "Kinect on" if it is off.
 (Do not plug out the Xbox),

Before beginning the calibration process, read the following information.

Appliances, fans, people and other background noise may interfere with the hearing ability of the microphone. Make the room as quiet as possible before beginning.
Make sure your TV volume is loud. If you have a home cinema system, turn the volume up on that as well.


Go to Settings > Kinect > Kinect doesn't hear me.
Select "Start audio check". If prompted, reduce background noise, then try again.
