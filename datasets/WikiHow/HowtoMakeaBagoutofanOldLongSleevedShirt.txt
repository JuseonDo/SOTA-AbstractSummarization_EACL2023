 Make sure all buttons/zippers/designs etc. are above your cut. Cut it at the length you want it to be. If you want to carry books and heavy items, use a heavier and larger shirt. If it's just for clothes or beach items, any shirt would work. Cut a straight line across. Using a pencil or chalk and a ruler to get a straight line. Don't throw away the sleeves though.;
, This will be the top of the bag. Notice how it is already sewn for you.
 Use a double stitch for support.
, Do not cut the sleeves shorter than they already are. Cut a straight line where the curve for your armpit stops. Make sure the bottom it all straight. One sleeve is good for both straps.
 This will result in one piece of flat fabric.
 This divides it into two straps. Make sure both are equal in length and width.
 Press the sleeves flat. This step is optional.
 Make sure your bag is still inside out while you are sewing.
