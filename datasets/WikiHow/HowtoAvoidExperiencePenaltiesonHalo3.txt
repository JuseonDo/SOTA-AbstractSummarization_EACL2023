 Points are deducted as a punishment for not playing the game properly.;
, Every time you quit a game in progress 1 experience point is deducted from your total and you receive no points for the game you just quit.
 If you betray them, there is a high chance they will opt to boot you from the match and you will again be deducted 1 point and not receive one for the match you were booted from. Often, if it was an accident, apologizing will stop the person you betrayed from booting you.
 If this happens, even unintentionally, you will count as having quit the game and receive the according amount of experience loss.
 Getting angry and quitting or deciding to betray someone who has annoyed you can be avoided if you remain calm while playing. If you keep getting killed, hide instead of quitting and if someone is playing loud music, mute them instead of betraying them. This will save you getting experience penalties.
 These weapons increase the chance of you betraying someone and thus getting booted due to their large blast radius. In addition, trip mines are extremely volatile and if you don't communicate with your team, they might just walk into one.
 If you play within the game's rules, it is unlikely you will experience any penalties.
