 A photo of anything steam-powered is appropriate, of course, but you can also play with images of gears, airships, hot air balloons, and anything mixing Victorian elements with mechanical technology.;
,, This border size has been decreased a bit (the default value was a bit too large for the image).



Decide if you want to let Defocus on after reading the next few steps. In this example, it was left on, as it is the default.






And instantly we have an old looking photo.






You can leave it as it, but if what you want is a steampunk image, read on.
 Adjust the color curves to make it more vivid.
 The defocus option in applying the filter was a nice touch in making the photo look old, but you want to experiment with taking it into the opposite direction and apply a heavy sharpen.
 The stains are drawn randomly, so try a few times until you get something you like.
