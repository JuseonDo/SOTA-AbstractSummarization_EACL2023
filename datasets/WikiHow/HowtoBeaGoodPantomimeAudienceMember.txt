 One of the things an pantomime actor hates is the audience sitting there silently throughout the whole thing. It's frustrating for them, and that will affect their performance, and therefore your enjoyment of the show.;
, It's virtually impossible to try to capture the audience's attention if they won't make eye contact.
 Don't worry about offending the actors who play the baddies - they want you to boo them! It gives them something to work with.
 Pantomimes generally have songs in them, and it takes a lot of courage to sing on stage.
 Actors have probably spent literally weeks perfecting their comic timing. The least you could do is laugh.
 It makes everyone feel like their hard work has paid off, makes their confidence grow and this and adds to the quality of performance.
 That means no rustling sweet wrappers and no loud talking.
 It is highly irritating if it goes of in mid performance.
 Simple as.
 That is what you have an interval for. If you eat food in the theatre, it gives the cleaners so much more work.
 If you're not polite, they'll be grumpy and less likely to help you, which means no one wins.
 This is your cue to do concert style arm waving. It's little things like this that really makes actors feel happy and like you were a great audience.
 If actors can see you're having fun, they'll have fun too! And fun is infectious, so hopefully it'll spread to the rest of of the audience!
