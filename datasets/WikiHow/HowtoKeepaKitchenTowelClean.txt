Cotton towels are easy to wash and clean. They also remove dirt, stains and blemishes effectively. So try to choose them.;
, In order to kill germs, you can keep the towels in a microwave for some time.
 Hot water helps to remove dirt, stain and blemishes from the root. Bleach or baking soda can be used to remove bad odor and make your towels smell fresh.
 Some high quality towels are completely stain resistant and wrinkle free that don't need ironing; try buying these.
 In order to remove stains, you can apply stain cleaner on a stained area before washing the towel and then rinse it. Avoid softeners as they can reduce the absorption capacity of the towels.
 If you keep the towel soaked in hot water with detergent, then try to use only safe detergent and bleach that doesn't cause any damage to the fabric of the towel.
 Hang your towels in an open spot to air them out properly.
