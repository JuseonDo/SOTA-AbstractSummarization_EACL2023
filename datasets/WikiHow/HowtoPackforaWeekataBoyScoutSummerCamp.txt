 Grab a notebook and prepare to utilize your common sense. Write down what time of the year you are going, where the camp is located, what the local weather has been like in the past couple of weeks, how high the elevation is, if there is a lake, etc.;
, Is there a laundromat, showers, a mess hall, tents/cabins, etc.? Will you be able to wash your clothing at a common laundry station, or will you have to pack a week's worth of clothing? The answers to these questions will determine how much you will need to buy or pack.
 and what is required for them.
 Lay all of your clothing in groups on a flat surface, such as a bed, and put together a list. Packing too much is preferable to not packing enough.
 Lay these out next to your clothing. Don't forget a basic hygiene kit: toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, a towel, soap, shampoo, conditioner, a comb, and a washcloth.
 Make sure that all of your clothes and items are labeled clearly so they cannot be lost or stolen.
 Various juices, milk, and sodas are fine but water is always preferable to avoid dehydration. Some camps do not allow campers to bring their own food, so make sure this is allowed before you rush for refreshments.
 Bring books, music, art supplies, small toys, and games so you will have a variety of familiar things to do in your spare periods. You can carry these in a regular school-sized backpack that you take with you when you leave. Be sure this bag is not overpacked as most summer camps will offer many things to do other than merit badges.
 Do not simply stuff it all in carelessly; you may damage your items and it will be harder to save space. You may need more than one container if you are staying longer, or have a need for more clothes or materials. Take care that nothing is poking out of the trunk or pinched in the lid.
 This will keep out raccoons and other animals that may want your food. This will also prevent anything from being stolen.
