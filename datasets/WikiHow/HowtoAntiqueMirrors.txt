Latex gloves work best because they protect your hands while allowing you maximum dexterity.;
, A piece of cardboard works well for this purpose.
 Wait several hours, or until the paint can be easily removed.
 If it doesn't come off relatively easily, wait longer for the paint stripper to work.


To make mirrors look like antiques, it's not favorable to remove all paint. Aim for around 80 to 90 percent.
,,, Use a 1-inch (2.5 cm) paintbrush.


The black patina solution is basically acid. It will generally begin to eat through and tarnish the reflective surface in about 1 minute.
Naturally antique mirrors are often more tarnished on the outside edges than the middle. If you want to replicate a genuine antique look, work in this fashion.
,


Water neutralizes the acid and will stop the antiquing effect of the patina.
, Use a new paintbrush so there isn't any remaining patina on the paintbrush itself.


Whatever color of paint you choose will show through where the patina solution created spots. Choose black, silver, or gold for the most antique look. Also consider painting the back with a random combination of dark and light paint colors.
 Hang the mirror in desired location.
