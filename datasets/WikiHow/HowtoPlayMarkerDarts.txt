 Draw one large circle that covers almost all of the paper.;
, Make 2 circles inside the larger circle getting 2 inches smaller each time you draw them.
,, This is important because when the marker falls after you throw it, it will stain the floor. The paper will stop the marker from staining the ground.
 You may have as many as 5 players. Not only that, but you can also play independently by yourself.
 If you are playing the game with other kids, stand in a straight line about 1 foot behind the first person in line (just in case of any accidents.) Each player must have a different colored washable marker, so when the marker tip hits the target, you know which one is yours.
 When it's your turn, step back at least 3 feet away from the target. Take your marker, and hold the tip at a steady aim for the target. If you are having trouble figuring out if your aim is too high or too low, ask another player to guide you.
 When you feel like your aim is on point, carefully, but not too softly, throw your marker at the target and try to score it right in the middle.


Each person should get to throw a marker at the dart 3 times, so there are 3 rounds

, Remember the numbers you labeled the target with earlier? Those numbers are the points that you score. The goal of the game is to try to score the closest or exactly on the 5-point circle on the target.
