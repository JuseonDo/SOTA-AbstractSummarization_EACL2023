@summary
classification:

@summary
fire resistive construction is iso class 6.

@summary
building elements:

@summary
the exterior bearing walls and load-bearing portions of exterior walls must be of noncombustible materials or of masonry, but exterior nonbearing walls and wall panels may be slow-burning, combustible, or with no fire-resistance rating.

@summary
variations:

@summary
both pre- and post-tensioned concrete units have steel cables installed in the concrete to provide tensile strength.

@summary
advantages:

@summary
uses noncombustible materials

@summary
allows greater height and area than other construction classes

@summary
uses load-bearing members or assemblies that resist damage from fire

@summary
,

@summary
disadvantages:

@summary
expensive to construct and repair

@summary
provides a false sense of security

@article
 ISO Class 6 encompasses IBC Type IA.



Walls:

solid masonry, including reinforced concrete not less than four inches thick
hollow masonry not less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick
hollow masonry less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick, but not less than eight inches thick with a listed fire-resistance rating of not less than two hours
assemblies with not less than a two-hour fire-resistance rating


Floors and roofs:

reinforced concrete not less than four inches thick
assemblies with not less than a two-hour fire-resistance rating


Structural metal supports:

Horizontal and vertical load-bearing protected metal supports — including pre-stressed and post-tensioned concrete units — with not less than a two-hour fire-resistance rating



, With pre-stressed concrete units, builders pull the cables tight before pouring the concrete and release them as the concrete cures. With post-tensioned concrete units, builders pull one end of the cable tight after pouring the concrete.
