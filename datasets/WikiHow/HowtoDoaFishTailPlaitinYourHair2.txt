 Take a handful of hair from the crown, just as you would when starting a regular French braid.
 Split it into two equal parts, and hold one half in each hand.
 Just as you would for a regular French braid, choose a small strand to start the plait.
 Hold it in your right hand so it becomes part of the right section.
 It should be the same size as the strand you took from the other side.
 Hold it in your left hand so it becomes part of the left section.
 Keep taking strands from the sides of your head and weaving them into the fishtail. You'll see an intricate, beautiful braid begin to form.
 Use an elastic, a ribbon or a hair bobble.
