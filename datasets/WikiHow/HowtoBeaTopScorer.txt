), timetables or just reading it straight from your textbook! Try out different methods to find which suits you best.;
, Self-reliance is important in a top-scorers attitude so if you're new with this technique(sticky note reminders)try to get a trusted friend to remind you of your dailyÂ  duties and your sticky note reminders!

, Always study a month or so before your exams and do constant revision.
 being a top scorer is not just about doing well in your studies.Try to join competitions and contests no matter for small or big they are for example a national public speaking competition or a little school-organised coloring contest. This helps to boost your competitive spirit and eventually lead you into wanting to study to attain high scores and success so you won't be left out in the competition. Remember to join something you like and don't pressure yourself too much. Slow and stead wins the race.
 group study or do past paper questions (which are surprisingly fun). There are so many ways of making studying fun. Be creative.
, After you've achieved your studying goals, treat yourself to something you like (chocolates, storybooks, etc.) but only after you've achieved them.
 Ask a teacher for help if you don't. Go all out to understand something.
 This might sound unrealistic but is the key to accomplishing something. Embed some confidence in those bones. It can't happen overnight but this slow process is rewarding. Be positive
