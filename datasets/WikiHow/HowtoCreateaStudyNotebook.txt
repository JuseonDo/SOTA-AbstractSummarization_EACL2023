 Preferably one that is college-ruled. You may choose to purchase a notebook that is made for 3 to 5 subjects, which is most recommended, or have a different colored notebook for each subject you have to study for.;
, Such topics include: Math, Science, English, etc. for basic school subjects, or more specific subjects if you are in college or university.
 Every section could have a table of contents telling what is in that subjects section in case you need to find one particular thing. However this may be difficult to do, if you are always adding things to various pages, and especially if you're not the type of person that puts exam dates on one page or topics to study in another.
 This can range from topics you need to study for an upcoming test, formulas for a math exam, or other study information on other pages along with practice questions to complete and study.
(see tips)

, Write in the various things whenever possible, whether it is during class or after class.
 Using your study notebook in class to write down class lecture notes can/will be helpful if you want to go on the internet and look up further information on the topic to study.
