 The symptoms of pepper spray might make you feel panicked and powerless, but try not to scream, clutch your eyes, or make any sudden movements. The pain will subside eventually. Take five deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose for five seconds and out through your mouth for five seconds.;
, If your vision is impaired, you may injure yourself further by trying to move by yourself. Ask someone to guide you to a place where you can flush your eyes and sit down.
,, Touching affected skin or clothes could spread the pepper spray to the person trying to help you. Be careful of contamination.
 Take off the clothes carefully. Seal off the clothes in a plastic bag, if possible.Try not to let the clothes touch anything.
