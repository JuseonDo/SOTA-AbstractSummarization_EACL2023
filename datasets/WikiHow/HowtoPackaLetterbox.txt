@summary
label your box that it is a "letterbox" and possibly with info about the hobby.

 The spot should be discreet and your box should not be visible or you run the risk of it being mistaken for trash or catch the eye of a curious vandal.;
, You may also want a box to include a pen, pencil, special ink-pads or even a "hitchhiker".
 You may want to double bag the journal/logbook. Quart size works well.
 A lousy hand carved stamp is better than a purchased stamp, but if you aren't an artist, consider purchasing a stamp that represents your hiding place well or have one custom made.
 Or you can be creative and make a unique journal, index cards, cash register receipt scrolls or you can make a custom journal to fit your letterbox.
, Do this in case someone accidentally finds your box and wants to learn more. An example label:


DO NOT REMOVE! -- DO NOT REMOVE! -- This is a letterbox -- “PEACE PILGRIM” -- Please sign our journal if you like, but replace everything just as you found it. -- For more info about this game: www.letterboxing.org / your email/ Letterbox Number.
 Try using nail polish or permanent marker.
