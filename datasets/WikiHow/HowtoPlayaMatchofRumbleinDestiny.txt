 Choose Rumble, and press and hold 'Y/Triangle' to launch.;
, Once it evaluates you and your fellow Guardians, you will be placed in a group. You will then launch.
 If it is fairly large, then you can either launch an assault, or stay back and pick off unfortunate passersby.
 Avoid getting killed. In areas where there is more than one enemy, make sure they're dueling each other before you enter the fight. Wait for one to perish, or jump in and steal a kill.
 The player with the highest score wins.
