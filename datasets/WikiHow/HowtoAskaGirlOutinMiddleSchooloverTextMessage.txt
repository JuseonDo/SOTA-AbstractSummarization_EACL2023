 From here on you can slowly ease into the topic of boyfriends and relationships without making her feel too uncomfortable.;
, If she sounds unsure, try to make the topic a bit lighter, but not too chatty. If she starts to show signs of relaxing, pick the topic up again.


If your crush sounds like the topic is really making her nervous, carefully change the topic and revisit it at a later time.
If she doesn't sound nervous at all, continue conversing with her about dating and boyfriends.
 Try not to (unless you naturally chat this way) use an abundance of exclamations points. This might make her nervous again.
 Don't pressure her by repeatedly asking her; she will feel awkward.
 Understand that there may be many reasons for her answer such as nervousness, her parents not wanting her to date, her thinking of you in a brotherly way, etc. Be polite and understanding in your reply.


Make sure you don't stay silent for too long, as she may feel like she really hurt your feelings. Don't make the girl feel guilty, no matter how sad or hurt you may be. This is an easy way to make things awkward between the two of you, or to ruin a friendship that could have sparked into something at a later point.
 Never say something soppy either like: 'I promise you won't regret it, darling'. Be individual in your reply! Tell her that you care for her, and ask her questions about how romantic she is, if she liked you before, etc.
 If she isn't the fluffy romantic type, you should still give her some love. Don't be too cliché (e.g. chocolate, moonlit dates, a lot of candlelight, flowers) and be personalized and individual with whatever you do with her.
 Try to stay friends with the girl and accept that things don't always go the way that they are planned. The world keeps spinning, and there are many paths out there for you to choose from.
 Trust in her and don't act too protective and jealous. Best of luck to you both and congratulations!
