 For example, show a picture in your cap and gown the day that you graduate. This gives the impression that you are often doing something. However, it is best to have one standard picture to revert back to after you show your novelty one a few days.
 Geographical networks tend to be looser and detract from your sense of connection.
, The "interested in" is redundant unless you are not heterosexual. Saying that you are "looking for" a relationship makes you look desperate, so listing yourself as "single" should suffice. Sometimes it's best not to fill out this part. If it's not something you'll say to a classmate, then don't write it down.
 This is cruel for those who might be pursuing you.
 Five or six is enough, and make sure they are not inside jokes.
