@article
 The wooden scabbards are not enough for a sword to be fully protected. You should invest in a sword carrying bag. Try not to make it too big or too small.;
, Keep 4 (four) fingers on the saya and your thumb on the tsuba of the sword. Never let your thumb off of the guard; this is to prevent your sword from coming out in the event that you lean forward.
 If you hear it rattling around as you pull it out, you aren't pulling it out right.
 It is a must that the registration card is tied to the scabbard. You may also find it sewed onto the sword bag. In Japan the owner of a real Japanese sword has a legal obligation to have his sword together with its registration.
