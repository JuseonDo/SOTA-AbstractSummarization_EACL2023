 Prepare the baking trays or sheets by lining with baking (parchment) paper.;
, When they form a light, fluffy mix, they're done.
 Mix well.
 Add the ground ginger as well and stir thoroughly.
 Since these cookies are designed to spread, keep plenty of space between them, having about four cookies per baking tray. Flatten with back of a fork or spatula.
 Bake for 5 minutes.
 Wet a fork and flatten them while shaping them into neat rounds.
 Bake for another 3-4 minutes. They're ready when golden brown in colour.
 This will help to firm them. Then turn out on a wire cooling rack.
 Then spread the other half with the white chocolate. Allow to set.
 They make an excellent addition to an afternoon tea.
