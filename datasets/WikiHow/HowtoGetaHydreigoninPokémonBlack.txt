 You must first catch a Deino, which can be found on the 1st and 3rd floors of Victory Road by walking, and it has a 20% of showing up. The location of Deino is the same in both Black and White.;
, It would also be wise to have a Pokémon who knows the move False Swipe. No matter how strong your Pokémon is, the move False Swipe will always leave the target with at least 1 hp.
 Dusk Balls are very effective at night, or in dark places such as caves.
 Wild Pokémon may surprise you by having high-damage dealing attacks.
 Beware of moves that burn or poison, as they will drain the Deino's life, possibly before you can capture it.
 Deino doesn't evolve into Zweilous until level 50.
