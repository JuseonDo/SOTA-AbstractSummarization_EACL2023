 The cleanser should be alcohol-free and gentle. Though many products on the market offer miraculous results, they are often just hype. Look for cleaners that have simple ingredients that won't damage your skin.;
, If your skin is dry, look for a product that has low pH numbers (4 or 5), and if your skin is oily or acne-prone, choose a cleanser that has a high pH number (6 or 7). This will help even out your skin's ability to fight off bacteria.
 Use a small circular motion, start at your neck, and rotate toward your nose or counterclockwise. Don't forget your forehead and the spots in front of your ears.
