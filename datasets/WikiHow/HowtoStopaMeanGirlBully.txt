 Bullies crave attention, and female ones aren't much different. If she bothers you, she'll expect a response, so if you decide not to give her one, she'll eventually grow bored with you.;
, Make sure you tell them not to mention your name so you aren’t labeled a snitch. By doing so, not only will you get your problem out, but you'll also be getting it off your chest, and sharing it with someone who cares.
 It shows confidence, that you couldn't care less what she does. If she can sense you're 'weak' or scared, she'll go after that. When you're making eye contact, and she looks at you, just give your hair a flick, smile, and turn away.
 However, if you are being physically threatened, (with guns, knives, etc.) do whatever you can. Do NOT start a fight or a riot; it will only create tension, and an audience, which may lead to a principal or boss pulling you into their office for a talk.
 This is the key to making her stop. Make her feel bad about bullying and try to shut her up so that she can't bother you. In other words, say something that she can't answer. Nevertheless, make sure it's not something that she can later make a comeback from.
, Even if feel like it's the worst thing in the world, know that it will pass over some time. You won't have to spend the rest of your life with her.
 They do that to make people scared.
 Is it only you she's bullying? Maybe she has other victims too. Talk to them about it; see if she is doing the exact same thing to others.
 Hard kidding, making you the butt of the joke all the time, put-downs, and harsh criticism for no reason can't slide. If it's been going on for months or longer, it's a red flag. If it's a friend that's doing this, your friend is slowly wearing you down and that's indirect aggression.
 Don't try to butter up to her. That’s weakness in her eyes and don't provoke anything. (Your talents provoke her already.)

, It's just a way of telling them you want more meanness! Don't say negative things!
