 Young and unbalanced, or old and stiff horses might find this hard., If your horse has minimal tack, you may be able to carry everything in you arms, if not there are tack trolleys to help you, or you can use a clean wheelbarrow. You must have somewhere safe to put your saddle when you get to the stable. You could install a folding saddle rack outside the stable., Have the dandy brush in one hand and the body brush in another. Tuck the handle of the metal curry into your belt or waistband so you can use it without having to hold it. Wear full-chaps or over-trousers to avoid getting your jodhpurs/breeches dirty., This is very good if you need to get to a lesson quickly, but you should do a full groom every day so that you can bond with your horse (even if it's a lesson horse) and find health and body problems sooner rather then later., It’s faster than using a mane comb. There are expensive tail brushes on the market, but a cheap or old hairbrush works just as well., This will make it easier to brush out and keep clean., There are also useful at shows to give a last minute clean to the horse’s coat, tack or your boots., A clipped horse is easier to groom and cool down then one with a full winter coat. The horse must be rugged to be kept warm. Partial clips are a compromise, where only some of the coat is clipped off. Do not do this, however, if you are not riding your horse consistently, and make sure you know very well how to clip a horse., A pulled mane is easier to care for. Hogged manes (clipped off) need no care at all, but only suit some types of horses like cobs. Only pull a horse's mane after a work-out so that his pores are open, and the hairs come out more easily. You should also learn how to do this from some one with experience.
