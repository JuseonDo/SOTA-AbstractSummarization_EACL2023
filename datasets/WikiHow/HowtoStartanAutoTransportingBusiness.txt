 There are auto transporting businesses that provide open car transport for regular vehicles, specialized auto transporting businesses that offer enclosed car transport for vintage and exotic vehicles, and those that provide both types. Open car transport utilizes car haulers on which the vehicles are exposed to the elements, while enclosed car transport makes use of special car haulers that are sealed on all sides to protect the cars inside.;
, If a competitor already covers a large part of the market, consider specializing in one specific niche such as vintage car transport.
,,, In most countries, these are issued by the Department of Transportation.
 When starting an auto transporting business, you're required to carry insurance on each cargo, though the amount will vary depending on your location.
 You'll need good access to major routes as well as sufficient room to load and unload the car haulers. Check with your city to make sure you comply with local zoning laws.
,


For a regular auto transporting business, purchase at least one open car hauler.
For a specialized auto transporting business, purchase at least one enclosed car hauler, a winch, hydraulic liftgate, and high-strength tie-down straps.
 This means that they can hire you to transport cargo for them.
