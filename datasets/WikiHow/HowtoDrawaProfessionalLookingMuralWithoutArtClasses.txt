 Create a digital version of it for use with a projector.;
,, Most rental companies require at least a few days' notice.
 Lay protective covering over the carpet and any furniture that can't be moved during the painting process.
, Some projectors are meant for smaller screens, and you may not have enough room to pull them back far enough to fill the entire space. If thatâ€™s the case, rent a projector that can make your image significantly larger.
 Use pencil so that you can erase any errors. Outline as much or as little of the image that you want to use. Dim the lights if necessary.
 For the outline, use the smallest brush possible. Then, paint in the rest of the image with your selected colors.
