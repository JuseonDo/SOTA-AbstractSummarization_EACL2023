visit a marina and ask around; there’s sure to be a captain preparing for a voyage and looking for free help.

 You don’t have to have sailing experience to be on a crew; all boats need cooks and other help. If you have specialized culinary or mechanical skills, you may even get a paid position on the crew. But there are plenty of captains who are looking for people who want to exchange work for free passage.
