, Below that heading you will see two links that say "In browser" and "Download". Click on the link that says Download.
 Download this server and place it anywhere on your computer for now. Be sure it's in a place you'll remember later so you can access it more easily, like your desktop.
 If you see a version that matches your Minecraft version, download that file.

If you don't see one that matches your Minecraft version, you will either have to use a developmental build (not recommended for beginners) or play with a downgraded version of Minecraft that matches the current recommended build you just saw.
 Now would be the time to move the Minecraft_Server.exe you downloaded before to your desktop.
 This can be named anything you want, but try to name it something that explains what will be in the folder. "Server", "MC_Server", and "Minecraft_Server" are all decent examples of possible folder names.
, Select "Rename" and name the file "craftbukkit".
 Enter the following, formatted the same way (for Windows):

java -Xmx1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar -o true
PAUSE

, Under the drop-down menu that says "Save as type: Text Documents (*.txt)", click on All Files. Save the file as: run.bat

, Now, double click on run.bat and you might see Command Prompt open up and a bunch of error messages. This is completely normal the first time you run a server since it is generating all of the files necessary. Once the world is generated, stop the server by typing "stop" in Command Prompt without quotes.
 If you go back to your server folder, you should see a bunch of files that were created after running your server. Leave these alone for now.
