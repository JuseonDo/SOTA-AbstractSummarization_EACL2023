 Then draw this line intersecting the horizon line, with one inch on either side.
 Use your ruler for all lines from now on and keep your verticals straight. You will be referring to the paper's edges to keep lines straight, even if you aren't aware of it.
 Draw two more vertical lines at 2 inches (5.1 cm) on the left and 3 inches on the right.
 This will give you a two sided shape, a cube or box.
 Start by finding the center of one of your house walls. Lightly make a cross on one of the house walls by running ruled lines diagonally, cutting the rectangle into fourths.
 Make this line as high as you want the peak to reach.
 Draw lines downward from the peak to the house, Hold your ruler against the angle that you've already drawn and drag the ruler across the drawing to get the correct angle for the other side. Keep it at the angle so you can mimic that angle on the far side of the roof. Draw that line.
 Holding the ruler at the peak, draw a line to the right vanishing point to complete the roof.
 Eyeball where you want these and lightly sketch their placement.. Just make the door tall enough for a person to walk comfortably through it.
