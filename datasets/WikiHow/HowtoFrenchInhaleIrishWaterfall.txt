 Don’t inhale the smoke into your lungs. Bring your tongue to the back of your mouth and use it to trap the smoke. Let the smoke sit in your mouth for a moment before moving on to the next part of the trick.

, Don’t exhale or blow the smoke out of your mouth. Let the thick smoke flow out of your mouth slowly, keeping your tongue positioned at the back of your mouth.
 You want to start guiding the smoke up toward your nose. You still shouldn’t be exhaling. Your lip and jaw should be sticking forward and you should feel like you have an underbite.
 Without exhaling, slowly move your tongue away from the back of your mouth and toward the front, pushing the smoke in your mouth out of your lips. This should be a slow, gradual movement. Avoid pushing the smoke out too quickly or it will dissipate before you're able to finish the trick.
 Slowly inhale through your nose while at the same time continuing to push the smoke out of your mouth using your tongue. Don’t inhale too quickly -- you should be slowly filling up your lungs with air through your nose. You should start to see the reverse waterfall effect in the smoke that's entering your nose.
 If there's leftover smoke in your mouth or you're having a hard time inhaling it all through your nose, exhale and blow the smoke away from your mouth.
