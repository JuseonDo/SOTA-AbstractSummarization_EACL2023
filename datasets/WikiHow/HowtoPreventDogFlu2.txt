 Just as people who are sick are advised to stay home and not to go into the workplace (where they can easily get others sick), so, too, are dogs best to stay at home and away from public places like doggy daycare where they can infect others.


If it is a great inconvenience for you not to be able to take your dog to doggy daycare (or to other public places), consider hiring a dog walker who can come to your home once during the day and let your dog out for a bathroom break and a walk.
This is another way to ensure your dog is looked after during the day, and to give him or her exercise, without needing to rely on public venues to do so.
 If you subsequently touch another dog, he or she may become infected. Therefore, if your dog has been diagnosed with canine influenza, be sure to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after petting him or her to prevent the infection from spreading.
 Even though canine influenza is a virus (and as such cannot be "cured" with antibiotics), the antibiotics serve to prevent what is called a "secondary bacterial infection." What this means is that, while your dog's immune system is working to fight off the virus, he or she is more susceptible to catching a bacterial infection; therefore, the antibiotics serve to prevent this, and to ensure that your dog recovers as quickly and easily as possible.
