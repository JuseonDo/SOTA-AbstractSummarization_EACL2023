get a large electric kettle, preferably with a hidden element but, as they are expensive.

@summary
boil cans of soup, ready meals, tins of meat and vegetables.

@summary
understand that all canned food is routinely sterilized in an oven immediately after being sealed.

@summary
place the can in the kettle first, cover it with water, and bring it to a boil.

@summary
once the kettle has come to the boil, switch it off.

@summary
wait 10 minutes before switching it on again.

@summary
try using the remaining water to make instant mashed potatoes, but there is no reason why you shouldn't cook boil-in-the-bag rice, pasta, or fresh vegetables in there as well.

@summary
understand that you can accomplish a lot with just one kettle.

@summary
consider purchasing an insulated container of the type sold in asian shops to keep rice warm.

 It is alright if you have to manage with the conventional type.;
, In fact, you can boil almost anything in a can. Don't listen to urban legends; they won't explode.
 But sometimes when you open the can, some of the liquid may occasionally spurt out and can be messy, so cover the can over with a cloth when opening. They are sterile because canned food was originally invented for British soldiers in the Boer War and was meant to be eaten straight from the can.
 You could boil the water first and then place the can in, but you need to be sure that the insertion of the can will not cause the boiled water to overflow. You may prefer to put the can into the cold water first and bring it to boil along with the water.
 You will find that the label on the can will be coming off and if it is, it is a good idea to take the can out and remove the label completely.
 Bring it to the boil once more, switch it off and give another 5-10 minutes before opening the can, the contents of which it is guaranteed will be piping hot.
 Of course, while you are waiting for the vegetables to cook, the can is cooling, but the canned food is usually still warm.
 You can boil milk in a glass jar, for instance. Sometimes the jar might break if the glass is thick, but that usually only happens if you plunge the cold jar straight into boiling water. This happens with thick glass, if the outside experiences more heat expansion than the inside. But if it is allowed to heat gradually, then it will heat up evenly. You can cook good scrambled eggs in a jar as well, and boiled eggs can be put straight into the kettle.
 You can use that to keep food warm, and even finish partly cooked food in it.
