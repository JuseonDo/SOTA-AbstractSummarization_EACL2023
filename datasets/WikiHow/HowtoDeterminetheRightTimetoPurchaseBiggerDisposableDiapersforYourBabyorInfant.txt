look at your baby's diapers carefully.

@summary
ask yourself "is the baby in pain?",

@summary
go over to your child, and see how many fingers you can comfortably fit into the containment area of the child's diaper, assuming it hasn't been too fully soaked in urine yet.

,

@summary
release the child's diaper-tapes just a little bit.

@summary
take note of how much urine the diaper has absorbed.

look for an un-snug fit on the baby with their diaper's leak guards.

 Sometimes, an answer can be spotted quickly.;
, as you look at the baby's diaper area. Sometimes you can spot it being too tight without touching it!

,, Releasing the tapes may ease the pain in some instances, but don't back down just yet.
 The child could be crying because the diapers are too small to fit around their waistline, and they feel cramped.Look for the child's diaper to be super-saturated in urine, which may make the child feel uneasy and feel "cramped" inside the diaper all the time. Until they get bigger diapers, expect their crying to continue endlessly.
 But try not to touch any part of the rash, as you could scratch it off and cause a worse rash or infection on your baby.
 Continue to use your current diapers, but help pull out the leak-guards better from the side walls of the diaper when you unfurl the diaper and get it ready for use. When opening the diaper, run two consecutive fingers of one of your hands up the entire length of the edges of the inside linings (in tandem on the inside of the diaper) of the diaper. This will help release the static cling from the manufacturing process at the diaper factory on the production date.
