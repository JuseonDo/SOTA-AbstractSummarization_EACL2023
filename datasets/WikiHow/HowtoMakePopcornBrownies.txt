, It should be about an inch deep, but you can also line the pan with aluminum foil if you'd like.
 Melt your butter/margarine in a small pan over a low heat for a minute or two.

Having the butter at room temperature works best when doing this.
 Stir the caster sugar and eggs for two minutes in a medium sized bowl.
 In a separate bowl, stir together the cocoa powder and the flour for about two minutes. Stir them until they are completely mixed.
 Cream the butter in with the sugar and egg mixture until the butter combines with it.
 Pour the cocoa and flour mixture into a sieve, slowly sifting it into the egg mix, making sure there are not lumps.
 Add the chocolate chips to this mixture and stir until thoroughly dispersed.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape any remaining brownie batter.
 Insert the pan into the middle shelf of your oven. Bake for about 30 minutes, but periodically check on the brownies to make sure they aren't burning.
 Remove the brownies after 30 minutes of cooking. Let them cool for at least 5 minutes before cutting them into squares.
 Spread a small amount of clear glaze on your brownies.
 The glaze should make the popcorn pieces stick on the brownies. Enjoy!


Many different flavors of popcorn can be used here. Cheesy popcorn may not taste good, but other kinds of popcorn, such as caramel corn or chocolate can be delicious.
