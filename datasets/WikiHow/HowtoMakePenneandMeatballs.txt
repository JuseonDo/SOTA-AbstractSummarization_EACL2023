, First you will have to dice your tomatoes. Make sure the tomatoes will be able to be soften in the pot. Then dice your garlic and onions. Add some sugar to downgrade the chances of a salty sauce and or meal. Then mix in a pot and let simmer. Mix occasionally to reduce burning., Make sure that the meat is melted and easy to handle. Now take the meat and your seasoning. I would prefer you to use season with Black Pepper, Knorr Chicken Flavored Bouillon (found in Costco), and Garlic Powder. These seasonings will make your meatballs the center of attention.,, You can deep fry it or heat it in an oven the choice is up to you.,
