 Don't starve yourself right before a competition, or you run the risk of feeling faint and passing out the next day. Eat a dinner that will give you energy for the next day (think carbohydrates like pasta).;
, You want to ensure that you're clean. Taking a shower the night before will ensure that you'll look fresh, even if you accidentally wake up late.
 This includes cell phone, camera, extra socks, hairspray, bobby pins, toothbrush or whatever else you'll be taking!

, If it doesn't fit, make sure that you let the coach know.
, Make sure that you know your routines. Don't over-exert yourself, though, or you won't perform your best at the competition.
 Get directions to your competition and make sure that you have a ride there.
 Get a good night's sleep to ensure that you're energetic on the day of the competition.
