 Go to websites with info on Pokémon moves, and evolutions, such as Bulbapedia, Serebii.net, or Smogon. Or use the books.;
, Pokémon with combination types pose great threats to enemies, but be careful when choosing, because the combinations may not work together and add on weaknesses to your Pokémon.
 To achieve greater power, breed your team to gain moves, stats, and natures. The more levels that you train your Pokémon yourself, the stronger they will be in the future. It's complicated to teach, but use the IV or EV system.
 Don't rely only on one Pokémon or only one system of fighting. Work out weak points; use strong points to counter weak points.
 Before you start killing mercilessly, use the power items: Power Bracer, Power Lens, Power Weight, Power Anklet, and so on (they can be obtained at the Battle Tower). Also, use the Macho Brace. Train on Gastlys and Bidoofs.
