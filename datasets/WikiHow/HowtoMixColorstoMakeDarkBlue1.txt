 Make sure that you have enough paint to complete the coverage needed with this shade of dark blue. Once you have mixed the perfect hue, it could be difficult to match this shade a second time. Itâ€™s always better to make more dark blue than you need rather than run out.If you do not complete your project in one sitting, you can store your excess paint in an airtight container like a plastic container you would use to store leftover food.
Consider wetting a paper towel or sponge and placing it in the bottom of your container, or using a Sta-Wet Palette to keep your paint from drying out.;
, Avoid putting the black paint directly on top of the blue paint. Placing it next to the blue will allow you to add a little black at a time and give you more control over the shade.
 Be sure not to take much black paint on your first attempt. Black is a very strong color and a small amount will have a large effect.
 Fold the colors together using a mixing tool or cross-hatch strokes with your paint brush. You don't need to mix too thoroughly, which could dull the color. Just combine the paint enough to assess the shade., This could take several repetitions of adding black to the blue paint, but continue to use small amounts so you don't exceed the level of darkness you wish to create.


If you accidentally mix too much black into the blue, have some extra blue paint on hand to even out the ratio.
