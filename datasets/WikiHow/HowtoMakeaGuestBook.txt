 The size of the binder necessary will depend on how many guests you are expecting. Bigger may be better, since you don't want to expend too much effort in embellishing it only to find that it won't hold all of your collection. Use at least a 2-inch notebook.
 Keep it simple--all you really need is a place for the guest to write his name and a comment about the event. Leave space somewhere on the page to add photographs later. Make 2 copies for each guest so that you have extras for people who mess up., Draw a line all the way around the outside of the binder. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) on all sides, and draw a cutting line. This will be the pattern for the outside of the guest book., This is the pattern for the inside of the guest book., For a family barbecue, you might choose red gingham or calico, while a wedding might include white satin. The fabric for outside and inside may be the same, or you can select coordinating designs., Cut it out., Pin the inside pattern to it. Cut out the 2 pieces., Open the fabric and place it right side down on your work surface., Make a cutting line half the distance on each side of the pin. Cut on the lines down 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). Fold the fabric to the wrong side., Center the spine and press the binder to the fabric., Press the cover to the fabric, using a bone folder or a ruler to smooth the fabric to the edges. You will have 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) extra on each side. Repeat the process for the back cover., Fold it to the inside of the binder, and press it firmly., Repeat this process for the back cover.,, Ask them to sign the form and include a message., Embellish the photos with background paper, edging scissors or stickers.,, Slip them into protection sheets.
