The Prestige Menu is locked until you complete Level 55.



A message will appear, and warn you about the dangers of prestiging.

When you prestige, you will go reset to level one, and gain a new rank logo. You will have the choice between resetting all your stats, as well as any prestige, or unlocks; or unlocking a new Create-A-Class slot. You will also gain a token to permanently unlock any weapon.



You will be returned to level one, now prestiged and you will have a new rank logo. If you are entering First Prestige, you will also unlock an achievement called Welcome to the Penthouse.
