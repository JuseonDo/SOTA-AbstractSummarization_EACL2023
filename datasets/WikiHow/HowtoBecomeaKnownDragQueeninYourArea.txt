 Even if you would rather be loud and campy, it is helpful to understand the female form, the beauty of makeup, the essence of matching, and the art of quick thinking (trust me, you will need it).;
, Your audience, if at all versed in the world of drag, will judge/appreciate you accordingly.
 Drag Queens are prized for their audacious appearances, whilst others are considered legends for simply being beautiful and exotic 24/7. It is best to check out other drag queens to insure that you will be *unique* instead just run-of-the-mill (it's still one SUPER twisted mill).
 If you get the chance, get to know some of the performers; they can clue you in on the other performers, the club, the owner(s), the usual audience, and what the club is looking for.
 Try to get a spot in something small, like a talent show or a parade. Then, get as many bookings as you can and really build an audience for yourself, even if it is small.
 People like RuPaul and Divine became famous because of their ability to act and entertain when dressed in drag. If you work hard and fine-tune your act, you could be the world's next biggest drag queen.
