 You have to make sure it is rested and not overworked so there won't be too much strain on it later on. This includes keeping it wrapped in a tensor bandage, icing it every 2 or 3 hours for 15 minutes and keeping it elevated above heart level.;
, Take some more with you just in case the pain elevates during the event.
 Guys should be fine because they can simply wear pants and closed toed shoes to hide the bandages. As for ladies, they can wear a nice pair of dress pants, or try wearing some cute ankle boots to hide the bandage; ankle boots are very trendy!

, Wear trendy flats or some super low kitten heels! If you absolutely must wear high heels, find intervals during the event when you can take them off and walk very delicately.
 This keeps the pressure on your foot localized to one area and will allow you to walk without bending your ankles. This should be a relatively pain-free way to walk for minor ankle injuries. Be aware that if you are walking in high heels, it will be extremely difficult to keep your weight on the balls of your feet and will probably be painful.
,, Keep your legs still or slowly moving from side-to side and compensate by swinging your waist and arms around more.
,, Don't push yourself to stay out on your feet too late because you could do some serious damage to your already injured ankle. Your friends and family will understand if you leave earlier than usual; everyone gets tired once in a while!
