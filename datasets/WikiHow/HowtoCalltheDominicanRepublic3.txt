 Similar to the smartphone service, the apps use a computer’s microphone, speakers and webcam to video chat internationally for free. It is free from computer to computer, and charges will apply when calling from computer to landline or cell phone.
 The three most popular services are Skype, Facetime (for Apple computers) and Google Hangout.
 Add your contacts using the email that is associated with their account. You will need to encourage your contacts to download the software as well.
 Click the contact’s account to dial and request a video connection. Connection quality may vary depending upon the time of the call and how many users are online.
 You can invite multiple computer users to join your “hangout” and talk at once.
