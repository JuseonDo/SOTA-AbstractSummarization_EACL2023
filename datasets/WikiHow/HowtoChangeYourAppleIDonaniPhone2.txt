 This app resembles a grey gear, and should be on your home screen.
 You'll find this under the "iCloud" tab.
 This is at the top of the window. Your current Apple ID email address should be displayed here.
 This will prompt you to enter your Apple ID password.
 This should be the same password you use to log into Apple services such as iTunes and the App Store.
 This is at the top of the screen; tapping it will take you to the official Apple ID account page.
 You'll need to use your current Apple ID credentials to do so; these should be the same credentials you use for iTunes and the App store.
 This will take you to your account.
 This will prompt a menu with security questions.
 You'll need to answer two of them. This will allow you access to the Security tab, from which you can change your password.


If you've forgotten your security questions, you can reset them by tapping "Reset Security Questions" at the bottom of the Security menu. You'll need to enter your Apple ID password; Apple will then send a verification code to your registered phone.
 This will prompt you to enter your current password and preferred password.
 You will have to confirm your new password by typing it twice.
 This will complete the process.
 This includes phones, tablets, computers, and iTunes and the App Store.
