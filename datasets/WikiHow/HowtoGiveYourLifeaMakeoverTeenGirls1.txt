Get several big garbage bags and put the clothes in piles: throw away, give away, sell, laundry and clean.

Put the dirty clothes into the washing machine/hamper, while the clean clothes back in your closet after folding them and sorting them the way you want. This could be by color, style or usage rate.
Hang up any shirts, T-shirts, dresses, sweaters and cardigans etc., and fold up pants, jeans, leggings etc.

Sort the things on your desk into 3 piles: keep, throw away and give away. Do the same as what you did with your clothes.
If your desk has drawers sort them out like you did the surface of your desk.
Put back what you want to keep but make sure to put it neatly!

Strip your sheets of the bed and throw them in to the laundry.
Get new sheets that you like and are comfortable to sleep on, and put them on the bed. It's good to have a comfortable bed that looks good.
Arrange the pillows however you want it.
 Remember, whatever you put back make sure you put it back neatly!
