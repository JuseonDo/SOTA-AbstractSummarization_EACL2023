,, for the family. Each child's type of cancer and specific health situation is often known just to the family. If asked by the family to do any research then request that they ask the medical staff to write down the exact type of cancer and weather it is form 1,2,3 or 4.The ramifications of providing information to a family that ends up causing the family more fear and anxiety would be devastating to them and yourself. .
 Depending on the child's condition they may not be able or allowed to eat. Many children develop severe mouth ulcers as a result of chemo therapy and eating is very painful. Children on Chemo often do not want to eat. Ask the parent if there is anything the child is craving regardless of its nutritional value the calories will be a benefit. The parents will know if there are any restrictions.
 Don't promise everything will be OK. However keep talk positive and try to refrain from stating what you think is best unless asked. Many times parents just want to sit in silence and cry.
 The stress of worrying about the child that is ill and the children at home can feel overwhelming to parents.
 Offering to drive to appointments etc. is often a big help.
 People often don't realize just how much hearing from a friend helps keep parents feeling positive .
 Don't assume that because chemo is over that your friends life will bounce back to normal. It will take a long time before any sense of normalcy will emerge and even then it will be a new normal.
 Cancer often devastates a family financially. If you can help by arranging fundraisers for the family and if they don't need the assistance then consider helping to raise funds for cancer research.
