, Open the drop-down list button next to the Explore link at the top of the page and click the "Creative Writing" option underneath the Community tab at the top of the screen near the bottom of the list.,, Either one will take you to the same place. The Get Started link will be below the introduction to this part of the website and will only be displayed until you've successfully written your first piece, while the Add New Writing will be near the top right corner of the page and will always be available to be used.
 These will ensure you understand the rules. Also, take a skim through the Terms of Use for Writers page.
 Each piece must have a title.
 Don't be too descriptive though, leave something untold until you get into the piece itself. (Summarize the piece in a few words, but not so few that it's not understood very well!)

, Use a comma and space in between each term you will be using.
 Use the drop-down list near the "Genre" part of the page to categorize it.
 Think through all your problems as you type the piece out. Don't just freewrite. Think about the piece's characters, settings and plot and how they all interact.
 Base the answer to the captcha on the book image to the left of the textbox. They'll want the author from the image.


If the user has had their account open with Goodreads for years, they might have been grandfathered in. If you see a Captcha, type it. If you don't, thank yourself for having started it a long time ago and continue along in the process from there.
