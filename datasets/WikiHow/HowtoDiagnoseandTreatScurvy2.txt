 Your physician will start by asking you detailed questions about your dietary habits, to assess how much vitamin C you are getting. He or she will also perform a physical exam, looking for the signs and symptoms of scurvy.
 The reason that iron is measured as well is that your body's ability to absorb iron from your diet depends on the presence of vitamin C; therefore, if you have a shortage of vitamin C, you are prone to being iron deficient as well.


Both of these are able to be measured in simple blood tests, and there are treatment options available should you prove to be deficient in vitamin C and/or iron.
 This can give him or her an indication of the health of your joints and bones, and provide insight as to whether or not they have been negatively impacted by a potential scurvy diagnosis.
