 Grate the lemon in a small bowl and add the two tablespoons of sugar. Instead of mixing with a spoon, use your fingers to crush the lemon zest and sugar with your fingers.;
, Whisk until all the ingredients are combined well.
 Beat well because there are egg yolks in there and they need to blended well.
 Whisk as hard as you can, trying to make the flour streaks disappear.


It's alright to have a few bumps in the pancake batter, so long as there aren't too much.
 Add those in your batter and give it a good stir.
 Time to go sour! Add in your lemon and sugar mixture that you left aside earlier. Stir until the mixture is combined well.
 It should take about ten minutes for it to do so. Having it set aside helps the batter to be creamy and help the pancakes cook better. It may even make your pancakes fluffy!

, Put your stove on to medium and prepare a saucepan. Spread vegetable oil over it to prevent pancakes from sticking to the pan while cooking.
 Scoop in about 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto your pan. Once you start to see the edges brown, flip the pancakes slowly. Give flipping and cooking pancakes until your batter is done.
 Get your helping and serve it on a plate.
