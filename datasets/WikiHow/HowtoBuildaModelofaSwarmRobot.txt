@summary
cut two 4-6 inches pieces of 16 - 24 gauge wire.

@summary
bend both wire pieces at the middle; one shaped like a u and the other shaped like an m. these will be your swarm robot's legs.

@summary
cut a 1 inch by 2.5 inch thin piece of plastic, wood, or aluminum.

@summary
get a small dc powered universal brush motor.

@summary
solder one terminal of the motor to a 3 inch thin electrical wire.solder a 6 - 8 inch thin electrical wire to the other end of the motor.

@summary
if you're able to find a small switch, solder one end of the switch terminal to one of the electrical wires on the motor.

@summary
attach the motor to the body of the swarm robot with a hot glue gun.glue the wire legs to the body.tape one wire from the motor and the other end/switch) to a aaa battery.turn the swarm robot on and place it down on a flat surface.watch it shake around and roll like a swarming ant or termite.find as many motors as you can and build a robot for each one.repeat the building process and connect all the robots in series.use a cell phone charger to power them all at once.

@summary
solder a infrared receiver diode to a small servomotor and an electronic controlled board.

@summary
program each robot caring a e.s.c (electronic speed controller) with a e.s.c.

@summary
solder a set of color coded lcd's to the board.

@summary
solder an infrared transmitter the same way you connected and programmed an lcd.

 Any kind of wire you have available is fine. Some options are using a wire hanger, annealed wire, galvanized, electrical copper wire, or even pipe cleaners.
, This will be the body of your swarm robot., You can find them and salvage from small electrical toys, purchase online, or from your local hobby store. They are some of the cheapest, most simple and easiest to power and run. They can run from as little as 1.5 volts up to 12 volts depending on their size., For this build it won't matter which side you pick since universal motors run on either polarity (+ -) or (- +) and current charge (A/C. or D/C).,, This is an option if you want to turn on and off your robot without having to pull the cable, battery off., Attach or glue a single blade propeller to the motor shaft. This will cause the motor to run out of balance and shake and vibrate the entire frame of the robot.,,,,,,,, You can find these kind of boards from several open source Hardware and Open source Software available online to program each mini receiver boards to your Swarm Bots..

You can find any size or power capacity of suitable motor for your Project. Some surprisingly powerful miniature motors on cell phone or pager vibrators is a good way to Up-cycle all those old cell phones stashed in a box on the attic or garage.
 programing card. These kind of cards have adapters with fittings to the servo, Brush-less or stepper motors, a power source and a connection to a transmitter.

A programming card has a connection that fits the E.S.C's transmitter input adapter and a USB to program language and Code Instructions to the Swarm Bots.
 You can program your robots to light up a certain color and even behave or move for each different signals you're able to program and command your swarm., Now each Swarm-Bot will be capable of communicating with any other robot near enough or within sight of the infrared.
