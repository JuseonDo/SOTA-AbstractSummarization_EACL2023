, Most age groups won't wear it if it doesn't look good and fit may be an issue as many teenagers have issues with body image so getting too small or too big a size could cause offence. If you know they love clothes buy a voucher for a shop they like.
 A framed photograph, a collage of photographs and tickets or newspaper clippings, a handwritten letter about your hopes and dreams for them, how proud you are of their accomplishments and how you felt when they were born, as well as some of your news, or a handmade voucher for spending time together on your next visit will make them feel special and doesn't have to cost much money.
 Sports enthusiasts or fashion followers will appreciate being able to afford something useful that they can choose themselves.
 Baking some treats such as cupcakes, brownies or flapjacks, show you have put time and effort into it and they can share them with their friends. This is a nice gift if you feel a bit unsure of whether or not to buy them something as it shows you've thought of them but is informal enough that, if the family haven't reciprocated, you won't look overbearing or be out of pocket.
 However, it is impersonal and it makes it very clear how much you have spent which can be a bit of a nightmare if you are exchanging gifts. Keep it for emergencies.
