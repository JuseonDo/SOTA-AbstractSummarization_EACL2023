 Storage space is often limited, and lugging a large suitcase around gets old fast. Try to confine yourself to one small wheeled suitcase or, even better, a medium-sized backpack.


Limit your valuables as much as possible, and keep them on your person when you can. If you're carrying a computer or other valuable item that you can't keep with you, only stay in hostels that have secure storage available. Although most hostelers are honest, it only takes one dishonest person in the same dorm room to ruin your trip.;
, Read user reviews online, scan through guidebooks and ask fellow travelers for their impressions. Word of mouth will both help you avoid unclean or unsafe hostels and steer you toward gems hidden off the beaten path.
 If no rules are listed online or in guidebooks, call and inquire. Some hostels have nightly curfews, or close during certain hours of the day. Alcohol is not allowed in some hostels. Take careful note of check-in and check-out times.
 Finding your way to a new hostel in the dark can be an exercise in frustration, and in some places wandering around after dark is downright unsafe.
 Pay attention to whether you'll feel safe walking to and from the room--which might even be in a separate building--after dark. Don't be shy about asking to see the bathroom, too. If the accommodates aren't clean and safe you can usually walk away from the booking, although you will probably lose any advance deposit you've made.
 You won't have to climb over anyone else to get into bed, and you'll be able to store items under the bunk.
 While you're at it, bring earplugs in case your roommates snore, and flip-flops to protect your feet in what will probably be a shared shower.


Plan on wearing pajamas during your hostel stay, even if that's not your normal routine. Your new roommates will thank you.
 Some people stay in hostels specifically for the social aspect of the experience.
