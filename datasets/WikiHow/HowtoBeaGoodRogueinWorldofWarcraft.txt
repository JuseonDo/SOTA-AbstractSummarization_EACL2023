 A rogue is a slick damage dealer, so having the right weapons is imperative. Start by completing a few quests, then when at the level of about five, you can venture deeper into the world. Focus on using weapons with a high damage per second, rather than a high damage level. Your damage will average out.;
, From there, everything is uphill.
, This will also help with combo selection and organizing your action bars. Sometimes grouping with other people will improve these abilities

, They will appreciate a kind "Who should i sap?" and "Should i sap one of these guys". Remember, when in a group, sap will save you. Asking to sap not only tells everyone you are going to do it, but also prevents target confusion so other group members won't attack the stunned target. Grouping with a hunter who is skilled at using his "Mark" ability is a good way to make sure the party is on the same page.
