 (Yes, those are real animals, you may look them up.)

, For example, in X and Y, they based Dragalge on a leafy sea dragon and declared it a Poison/Dragon-type. This is normally easy, but for fun you can use another type combination.
 For example, a bushier tail, color change, a lightning bolt tail, flame tail, etc.
 Or, better yet, create your own moves.
 This can take forever, so how about this: for a turtle, combine it with a Flying-type. Research words that mean sky. How about heavens? That's easy. Combine the words you found, it can be three, four, or even two. For this example, you could call it Turavens or Heartle. Choose one.
 Now, do you know any similar animals? Or, just make a standing version and change the body features into new ones, maybe add a new element, and you've got an evolution!
