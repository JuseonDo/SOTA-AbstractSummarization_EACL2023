 In the UK banks are owned by shareholders while building societies are owned by their investors and are not traded on the stock market.;
, If you have poor or no credit you will require a 'basic bank account' as these do not require a credit check to be carried out. These accounts are designed to be widely available but do not offer overdraft facilities. If your credit is good then you will have a wider range of account options to choose from.
, You will need to complete an application form and present identification documents in order to prove who you are and where you live. UK law is strict about this. Acceptable forms of identification include passports, driving licences, tenancy agreements and utility bills. Your bank or building society will be able to answer any queries you have regarding identification.
