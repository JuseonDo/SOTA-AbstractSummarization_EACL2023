 You want the soil to be loose and light when sowing your sunflower seeds. If your soil is low in nutrients or drains poorly, mix in three to four inches of compost.
 You can simply use your hands to dig these small holes. If planting in rows, make sure to allow about 30 inches (76.2 cm) of soil between each row. Sunflowers need a lot of space to grow healthily.


For large sunflower types, allow 18 inches (45.7 cm) of space between seeds.
For medium-sized sunflower types, allow 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between seeds.
 You can stagger your planting over a few weeks in order to experience blooms at different times throughout the summer. Since sunflowers are annuals, meaning they flower once per year, staggering your seeds will allow you to enjoy blooms over a longer period of time.
 Choose an organic fertilizer when possible and spread it over the seeding area to promote strong stalks.
 Make sure you wet the soil, but do not drench or flood the seeds.
