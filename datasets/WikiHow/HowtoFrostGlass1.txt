Blue painter's tape. Painter's tape is specifically designed to endure wet applications. It has a weak adhesive allowing it to be easily removed.For windows with lattice work or muntin bars (strips of wood between the glass), cover the wood with tape.
If the 1-in. painter's tape width isn't a thick enough border, lay another piece alongside it. Use a tape measure to ensure that borders are symmetrical; uneven borders look bad.
If your window does not have a frame, simply tape along the outside edges until you have created a border.
 Use painter's tape to hold it in place.


Don't leave any openings or gaps where the spray could enter.
When working indoors, open doors and windows and turn on fans to help circulate fresh air. Consider wearing a particle mask to protect your nose and mouth. The spray fumes are hazardous to your health.Take the window outside, if possible. This ensures a healthy work space and decreases the likelihood of "overspray," and frosting spray drifting onto other objects.

While shaking the can, you should hear the small ball inside begin to rattle. Test spray on a small piece of cardboard.If it sprays correctly, prepare to frost your glass. If it is not spraying at a steady rate, continue shaking and testing in 1 minute intervals.

 Use the same back-and-forth motion to create a smooth frosted surface.


If necessary, apply a third or fourth layer of frosting until you get the desired effect. Follow the spray can's directions regarding the wait time required between coats.
 If you are satisfied with the appearance of the frosting, apply sealer.


Acrylic sealers protect glass from the elements such as moisture and dirt. The protective gloss coating is often permanent.If you are unhappy with the frosted surface after the sealant has already dried, you will need to scrape it off with a razor blade., Peel slowly to avoid accidentally removing the frosting.


If you worked indoors, remove the painter's tape cautiously. This will prevent removal of paint from the walls.
Use mineral spirits to clean any overspray from your hands and other objects. Do not use mineral spirits to clean items with paint or nice finishes, as this could damage the quality.
