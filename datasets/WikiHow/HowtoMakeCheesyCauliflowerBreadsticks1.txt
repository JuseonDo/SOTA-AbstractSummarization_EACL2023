 One head will yield at least 20 sticks depending upon how they are cut. Make sure the cauliflower is cleaned and washed before using.;
, You will also need non-stick cooking spray too.
 This handy tool is what will transform the chunky cauliflower to a mealy substance that will make the bread sticks more like bread and less like cauliflower.


Find a cheese grater or sharp knife. You will need to grate or chop the cheese to top the breadsticks.
 Make sure the baking pan has sides and isnâ€™t completely flat. The cauliflower mixer will essentially be poured into the pan so it will need sides to hold it in place.
