 Apply this polisher to a towel and scrub it in using a circular motion.
 A cleaner will not scrub this rust away. You'll need to use something mechanical like steel wool to try to fix this problem. Use steel wool to scrub as much of the rust away as you can. Although the chrome may never be perfect after rust sets in, you can drastically improve the look of it once the rust is removed.


Waxing and polishing the freshly de-rusted surface will help to further improve the chrome's appearance.
 Shake wax, and apply it to the chrome with a fresh cloth. Once it has been applied evenly to your chrome, take another cloth, and wipe it away.
 If your chrome lacks shine due to streaks, dirt, or fingerprints, taking a wet towel to it and drying it after should result in an immediate improvement.
