 Keeping the bar of soap, close by, is your reminder to use it.  More importantly, by not using this bar of soap for bathing, the bar of soap will be dry and not slippery.;
,  Set aside a brush just for this purpose in the wash area.  Any type of brush with a stiff bristle will do. The brush must be of some size and heft, for example it would be useless to try to pound on a stain with a toothbrush sized brush. It is very easy to remove ring around the collar, without pounding it, by agitating it, but agitating will wear out the fabric very quickly and create itchy fuzzballs.
 Place the shirt on the inside of a basin or on the flat part of a washboard.  Pre-soaking is an option before all this.
, Sprinkle a little water, on the brush or fabric, when pounding the fabric.
  Notice how well the ring around the collar was cleaned without agitation, or bleach, and just a bar of soap.
