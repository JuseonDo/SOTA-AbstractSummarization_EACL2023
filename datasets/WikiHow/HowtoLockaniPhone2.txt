 You will do this in the “Find My iPhone” area of iCloud. Turning on Lost Mode will prevent potential data thieves from being able to use your iPhone unless they can enter your passcode.


To use Lost Mode, you will need to have previously enabled Find My iPhone on your iPhone.
If you’re not sure whether or not you have enabled Find My iPhone, continue with this method to find out.
,,, The name of this function will be different depending on your version of iOS.


Turning on Lost Mode will also deactivate any credit or debit cards associated with Apple Pay. You will not be able to use them with your Apple account until you take your phone out of Lost Mode.
 If you have already protected your iPhone with a passcode, you won’t be asked to enter a new one. Setting a passcode ensures that your iPhone is unusable until the correct code is entered.
 This is helpful if you’ve lost your phone and hope someone will return it to you. The number will appear on the phone’s lock screen.


You may also be prompted to enter a message. The principle is the same—anything you type into this area will appear on the lock screen.
You can use Find My iPhone’s tracking features to locate your missing device.
 If you forget the code, you will have to bring your iPhone to a repair shop.
