 Read him books about babies and children who sleep through the night. Talk about how happy it makes Mommy and Daddy when he sleeps until morning. Make a point to emphasize that daytime is for playing and having fun, while nighttime is for sleeping and relaxing. Remember to reinforce every little step he makes with praise.;
, If possible, use an elevated baby crib that can turn into a daybed. It is best if the crib is the same height as your mattress. If using a mattress, place it on the floor next to your bed, as it would be dangerous to place your baby on a bed if she is old enough to roll.
 After rocking her to sleep, place her in her own bed. When she wakes up and cries, pick her up and soothe her, reinforcing the idea that you are still there and she is safe.
 By repeating this process you will be able to move the crib into his own room when he grows used to sleeping apart.
 Rub her back and make sure she knows you are there. Eventually she will begin to fall asleep more quickly each night.
 Eventually she will grow comfortable with her own room knowing that you will soothe her if she needs comfort.
