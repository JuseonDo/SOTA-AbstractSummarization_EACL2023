 This article explains how to use the one at http://www.toprankblog.com/tools/rss-buttons/;
, The most popular news aggregators' buttons are closer to the top of the list. You'll probably want to add these, but make sure not to add too many, as this will take up too much space.
 Each of these options are useful in different situations:



Default creates the basic code. This should be used if you don't know which option to choose or if you have a Feedburner feed.

DropDown Menu is the "cooler" option. It creates, as you might guess, a dropdown menu with your selected buttons in it.

Blog Specific is the option you should use if you have a Wordpress, Blogger, MovableType or Textpattern blog.
 The next step will appear very soon, if not immediately.
, Note that this is not the RSS feed URL.
 This is the URL of the .rss or .xml file.



If you selected Default, you can add separators to the outputted code.
If you selected Blog Specific, you need to select what blogging software you're going to put the buttons on, and you can add separators to the outputted code.
