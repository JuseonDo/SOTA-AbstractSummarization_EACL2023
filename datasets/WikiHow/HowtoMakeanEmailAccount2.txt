 Notable ones are yahoo.com, google.com, and hotmail.com, all of which are free forever.
 Usually, there is a small link image or text that says "register" or "sign up," although you may have to go to the login page to find this.


Type in "free email account" and the website of your choice into a search engine. Click on the appropriate link, hopefully bringing you to the setup page for the desired email account.
 In some cases, you may feel uncomfortable letting out certain information. Don't worry, most of the time email accounts do not need information such as telephone and street address, and you can skip these completely.
 Once completed, click on the Submit or Enter button at the bottom of the screen.
 You have now created an email address. Continue on to import your contacts, message with friends, or write emails, plus much more.
