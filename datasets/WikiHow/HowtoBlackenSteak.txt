 You want to use these lean cuts because they will cook evenly and blacken well. Choose steaks that are about 3/4-inch (1.9cm) thick.;
, Do not defrost them in the microwave, or you will ruin the process of blackening them.
 You can simply buy Cajun seasoning and coat each side of steak with 3/4 tsp. (approximately 1.4g) of the seasoning, or you can make your own. To make the rub yourself, whisk together the ingredients listed above and apply them to your steak.,, Place one side on very high heat and the other side on low. Spray the low heat side with a little cooking spray before you start the grill.
 You want it to be as hot as you can get it. Allow it to heat for 20 minutes.
,, You may want to cook your steaks one at a time if your cast iron skillet isn’t very large. You don’t want steaks to touch while they are blackening.
 The butter may catch on fire, and that is ok. Don’t adjust the cooking temperature.
 Cook them for three minutes on the second side. You don’t need to apply more butter.
 Keep them on this side until you have reached your desired doneness. Rare steaks can start to rest immediately after blackening.
, Cover the plate with tin foil. Turn off your grill.
