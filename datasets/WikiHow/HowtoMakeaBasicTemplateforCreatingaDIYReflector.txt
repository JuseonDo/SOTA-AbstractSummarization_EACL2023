 You can usually find that at a nearby dollar store or a craft store. Measure out a 9" X 12" inch 'sheet'.;
, Draw a line 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) from one short side and another one 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the other short side.
, Check and recheck. The actual cut in the screenshot was made with the measurements backwards. You want the 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) to be the height of the triangle and 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) as the base of the triangle.
 In this screenshot, this is indicated by the two black lines. This is where you will draw a line in the material you use to create a 'cup' type of shape for your reflector.
 This will help you to form a type of bowl to keep your reflector from losing the light.
, This template will give you rough ideas of where you want things.


Remember that one side (like the front) will be the hook side of the Velcro and the other (the back) will be the loop side of the Velcro.
 In this screenshot, the one on the left used the reflector, the one on the right, did not. Other than that, there was no change made in how the two photos were shot.
