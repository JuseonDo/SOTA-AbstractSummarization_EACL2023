Go to View > Toolbars > Fontwork.
If you click on an existing Fontwork object, the Formatting toolbar changes to display the Fontwork. The contents of this toolbar vary depending on the OpenOffice.org component.
 If the Drawing toolbar is not visible, go to View > Toolbars > Drawing to display it.
 The Fontwork object will appear in your document. Notice the blue squares around the edge (indicating that the object is selected) and the yellow dot; these are discussed in Moving and resizing Fontwork objects.
 Type your own text in place of the black Fontwork text that appears over the object (Figure 4).
