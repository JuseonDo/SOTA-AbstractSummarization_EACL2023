 Bananas are great at exfoliating your skin, and returning that healthy glow. They are also very moisturizing., Honey is not only moisturizing, but also antibacterial. It's great for relieving dry skin and zapping blemishes., Lemon juice is great for those who are fighting acne and other blemishes. It tightens pores and reduces oil.It also helps exfoliate the skin.Keep in mind, however, that lemon juice makes your skin extra sensitive to sunlight. It is best to use this mask at night, before you go to bed.
 The extra honey will help balance out the extra ingredient. It will also give your facial some extra moisturizing powder.
 There should be no lumps, chunks, or clumps. You want the texture to be smooth.
 Take care to avoid the delicate area around your eyes. Place any leftovers into a jar, and refrigerate them.
 While you wait, try to keep your head as upright as possible, so that the facial doesn't slide off.
 If you need to, use a gentle facial cleanser. Follow up with a splash of cold water upon your face; this will seal your pores. When you are done, gently pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel.
 As you continue to use it, you'll notice a reduction in dryness and/or blemishes. Your skin will also have a healthy glow.
