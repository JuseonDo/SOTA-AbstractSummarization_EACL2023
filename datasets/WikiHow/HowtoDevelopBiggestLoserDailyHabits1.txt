 People who spend just an hour per week exercising or just an hour in the kitchen will experience less weight loss than those who spend multiple hours in the kitchen and several hours exercising.;
, Identify the psychological reason that you are overeating. Verbalize the situation and address it instead of turning to food. If you need support, then contact a therapist or other mental health expert.
 Try posting a photograph of yourself from a time when you were at a healthy weight so that you can stay motivated by the vision of a thinner you.
 If you have children, then think of how losing weight will help you to be active with your children. Also, think of how living healthily will allow you to live longer and spend more time with the people you love, doing the activities that you enjoy.
 Changing negative habits will be difficult. Expect to feel as though you can’t do it and as though you want to give up. Then, instead of giving up, “dig deep” and believe in yourself.
 When you have a large amount of weight to lose, the task can feel impossible. Focus on taking the program one day at a time and one pound at a time.
 Your healthy habits will set an incredibly positive example for your children and for other important people in your life.
 If you fail one day, then start over the next day by getting back to the program.
