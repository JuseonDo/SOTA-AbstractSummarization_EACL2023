 Most plants need at least 2 watts per gallon to grow properly. If necessary, upgrade your lighting.;
, Beginners are recommended to start with easy plants that do not need a lot of light and do not require CO2. Here is a list of some very basic plants:

Water wisteria






Java moss






Anubias






Cryptocoryne wendtii






Amazon Sword







, Plants can be grown in normal gravel, but your choices will be limited, as most plants do much better in a sand substrate. Whatever you choose, make sure you layer at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick and it is advisable to put a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of eco complete or a similar plant substrate underneath. This will provide nutrients for the plants.
, Gently remove the plant from the container and use a toothpick to untangle the roots if the plant has become root bound.
 Gently place the plant in the depression and cover its roots with substrate. Some plants will die if you accidentally cover the crown of the plant with substrate, so be careful.
 After that, you can start fertilizing with a liquid or tablet fertilizer. Make sure you choose one that contains essential micro nutrients like iron. If you are on well water, the water will contain many of these micro-nutrients already.
