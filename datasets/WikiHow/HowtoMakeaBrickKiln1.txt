 This may be determined by the size of your kiln shelf or how much space you have for a kiln.;
, Plan to build the kiln so the wind can enter into it from the top.
 Smooth the dirt so it is level. This provides an even foundation for your kiln and protects anything under the dirt, such as concrete, which can crack under a kiln's high heat.
 Stack 2 rows of bricks for each wall. Use enough bricks to allow your kiln shelf to be diagonally laid across the walls later.
 Each brick should extend about halfway past the wall to form a sort of doorway for the kiln. These 2 bricks should be placed with their longer, narrow side down on the ground.
 1 edge of the grate may extend over the back wall while the sides of the grate fall within the inner edges of the kiln's side brick walls. Ashes from the kiln will fall through the grate.
 Place them on top and around the grate to build up the kiln's 3 walls.
 It should be arranged diagonally or like a diamond so 3 of the shelf's corners are supported by the kiln walls.
 The sheet iron should go partially under the kiln shelf's fourth corner to support it.
 These bricks should go around all 4 sides of the kiln.


Some of the bricks in this row will be balanced on the kiln shelf. Use pieces of broken shelf or other scrap material to even out the height of the other bricks.
 Place additional bricks in a smaller circle inside the first one.
 The hole will act as a chimney to let smoke out of the kiln. Cover part of the top of the kiln with more broken shelving or scrap material to form the hole.
