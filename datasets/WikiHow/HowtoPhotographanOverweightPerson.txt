 Either a telephoto lens or a long zoom. This helps to compress the shot and reduces distortion.;
, Shoot straight across or at a bit of an upward angle.


Shooting from a higher location looking down is a common ploy used by photographers and is considered somewhat overused. However, try it and see if it helps.
, Try headshots and head and shoulders shots.
 Short (or narrow) lighting works well with rounder faces.
 Have one shoulder angled away from the camera.
 This way, the main light can light the side that is turned away and a weaker fill light for the other side of the face. You will need to experiment and adjust because it will show more facial contours than broad lighting will and may give a more masculine look.
