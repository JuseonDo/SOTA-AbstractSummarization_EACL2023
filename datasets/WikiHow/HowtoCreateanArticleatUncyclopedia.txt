If the title already exists, it'll show you that article. Try a new title, or just fix up that page and make it even funnier. After all, you are a funny person with a lot to say.






If you get a search page with similar titles (you may prefer to edit one of these instead) you have hit pay dirt! Your title is not in use. At the top of the page there should be a red link to the title you typed. Click that and you should be presented with a blank editing box.
 The beginner's guide and and how to be funny and not just stupid are particularly recommended.
