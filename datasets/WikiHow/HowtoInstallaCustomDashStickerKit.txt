 eBay and Amazon are often good choices but simply searching "custom dash kits" in Google will bring you a bunch of great results as well.

Enter your automobile's make, model and manufacture year when you find a website that you like so that the product that you order will fit your dashboard.
Choose the finish that you like the best. There are many wood finishes, metal finishes, carbon fiber finishes and bright colors to choose from.;
, Oil, grease and dirt will all keep the adhesive from sticking properly to the dashboard., Make sure that all buttons, knobs and vents move easily when the pieces are in places.,

Begin with the small finish pieces first so that you become familiar with the process before moving on to the larger pieces.
Apply large finish pieces left to right, smoothing as you go to make sure that there are no air bubbles caught underneath.
