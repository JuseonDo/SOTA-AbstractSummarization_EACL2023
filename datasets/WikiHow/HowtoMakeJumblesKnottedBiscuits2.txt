 Line the baking sheet(s) with parchment paper.
, Add the spice or caraway seeds as well. Mix to combine.
 Add just enough to turn the mixture into a firm dough, adding the water gradually.
 Cut off lengths measuring around 10cm or 4 inches.
 Take two lengths and twist them by wrapping one length around and around the other length. There is no need to do anything fancier than this, although you could shape it into a knot as well, if you're confident.
 If you want to boil them, follow the instructions outlined in the method above. If you simply want to bake them, place in the preheated oven.
, Allow to cool slightly, then serve either warm or just cooled.
 These can be eaten warm or cool but they're best eaten when warm. They should be enjoyed on the day of baking; they toughen up after a day or two.
