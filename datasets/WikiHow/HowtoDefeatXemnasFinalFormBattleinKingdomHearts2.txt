, Try to use very little magic and limits. You can also Auto-reload Ethers or Don't equip Any action abilities, save for Cure Potion, Eternal Session, Dark Shield and Dark Aura and of course your abilities.
,,, He also like stops, but then he uses lasers. Don't attack to his copy. He doesn't have any hp and other.
 This is the only time that you can control Riku, without the cheat codes. ONLY use Dark Aura and move to Sora, before his health goes down to 0. Try to make sora take plenty of damage because then Riku can use Cure Potion and you have more chances to rescue him!. You can also, try to get the another Xemnas hitting Riku's back, which would towards Riku, more closer Sora!

, When Xemnas have very little hp left, he makes his ultimate attack! He summons 1,000 lasers so use both Reflect. The Reaction Command is for Riku and the X button is Sora. To make this easier, turn the controller sideways and rapidly tap the triangle and X buttons to block the lasers.
