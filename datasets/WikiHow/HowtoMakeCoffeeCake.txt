, This will prevent the cake sticking to the tin while you remove it after baking.
, Put one tablespoon into the cake mixture. Stir it in and add up to one more tablespoon of the coffee mixture into the batter; save the rest for later. Drop the walnuts into the batter as well, making sure they are in half before you put them in.
 Level and even out the top and place it in the oven for 40 minutes. You can tell if it's correctly baked or not by inserting a toothpick or a skewer in the cake& it comes out clean and dry. Remove the cake from the oven and set it aside for cooling.
 Pour in the leftover coffee mixture, but stop pouring when you see the color and flavor that you want. Add a little more icing sugar if the mixture seems too soft.
 Do this by dividing the cake horizontally. Frost each layer before placing another layer on.
