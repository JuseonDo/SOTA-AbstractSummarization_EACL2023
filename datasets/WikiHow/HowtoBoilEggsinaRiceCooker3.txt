 In a large bowl, add cold water and ice cubes so that it fills up to the rim.
 Use plastic or metal tongs to remove them from the rice cooker, one by one. Immediately place them in the ice bath.
 Allow the eggs to completely cool in the ice bath. You can test them out by handling them with your fingers. Serve them immediately or store them in the refrigerator.
