 You may remove the cabinet doors entirely if the hinges are visible or if they are easily removable. This will allow you to paint the cabinet face and shelving thoroughly and separately with little mess.;
,, Apply the chemical carefully per the manufacturer's instructions. Once clean, rinse all surfaces thoroughly with fresh water and allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.
 You will want to create a rough enough surface for the paint to stick to, so ensure that all surface areas are well scuffed. Once you are finished sanding, clean all of the dust away by first vacuuming the surfaces and then wiping them with a clean, damp cloth. Again, allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.
 You can purchase an appropriate primer at most hardware stores. Allow the primer to dry completely per the label instructions.
 Oil-based paints provide a smoother finish and are easier to clean, so they are the better choice for kitchens and bathrooms. Apply paint with a roller to avoid leaving brush strokes on the laminate surface.
