 You can use whatever type of ink you like, since the steps for this method aren’t time sensitive., Avoid rocking the stamp back and forth. Then pull the stamp straight up to avoid any smearing., This scrap stamping will act as a shield for the design you just stamped on your main material. Once you’ve stamped the design on a spare piece of paper, cut out the design out, following the edges closely. Place this over the design you stamped on your card or paper to cover it., Then place it carefully next to the original stamp that you covered with the scrap stamp. This allows you to get really close to the original design without worrying about stamping over it. Press the stamp down firmly.
