 This will be enough for one person., Keep mixing until the yolks break and everything is combined.
 Add in some salt and cayenne pepper. For extra flavor, chop up a scallion, and add it in. Don't worry about adding the cheese in. You will do that last.
 There is no need to cover the eggs. You are not cooking the eggs all the way just yet because you will be "scrambling" them with a fork.
 Be careful when handling the cup; it will be very hot.
 Use a clean fork this time, so that you don't raw egg into the cooked eggs.
 The paper towel will trap heat and moisture. It will also keep the eggs from drying out or turning cold. The eggs will continue cooking during this sitting time.
 You can eat the eggs directly from the cup, or your can put them on a plate. To garnish the eggs, get a cherry or grape tomato, and cut it into fourths. Place the tomato on top of the eggs.
