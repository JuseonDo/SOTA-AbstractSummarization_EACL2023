 All you have to do is subtract your age from 220. So, if you are 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is 180.;
, The American College of Sports Medicine says that when you hit this target, you maximize the amount of fat and calories you burn.
 Most machines in gyms and fitness clubs have a monitor that measures your heart rate; you simply need to put your hands in the designated location.
 When you get tired, slow your pace to a jog or a steady walk and then build back up to the 70 to 85 percent level again.
