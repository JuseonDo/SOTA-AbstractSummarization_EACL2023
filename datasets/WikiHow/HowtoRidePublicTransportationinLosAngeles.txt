 If you are going to take the bus or train on a regular basis, do a trial run before you actually have to take it for real. Time the route out, pick up as many schedules that are related to the area of your destination as possible. Also, pick up a system wide map if available.;
, Most buses do not have the ability to give change and asking the other riders for change is not the most efficient way to go about starting a trip. If your dollars are wrinkled, smooth them out as much as possible to ensure a smooth transaction at the fare box so that the people waiting behind you can enter the bus quickly. Whenever possible use "Golden Dollars" or Susan B. Anthony dollars. Be prepared.
 Some operators (bus drivers) know some popular locations on their route but they are really looking to the passengers to know where they are going.
 Each person is a traveler on their way to some destination. The bus may become crowded and patience is a handy thing to have. Short tempers do nothing but disrupt the progress of the bus and make the ride longer.
 If you are sitting down, stand up as soon as you see the bus. If it is not the bus you want make a motion for the bus to keep going or step away from the curb or stop. The best way to communicate that you do not want the bus is to step behind the bus bench if available. If on the freeway, because of the high rate of speed and momentum of the bus, sit down as soon as you realize the bus is not the one you want and vice versa if it is the one you need.
 Ring the bell as soon as you see the street or hear it announced by the operator or computer system.
 That gives you an extra edge in making sure you get your stop.
 He is concentrating on traffic and distractions cause unsafe conditions. After placing the fare in the fare box clear the area near the front door as quick as possible.
