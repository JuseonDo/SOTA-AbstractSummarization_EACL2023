,, If it's too dry, you can add some water.
 Continue doing this until there's no sticky substance left along the pot.
, Do this firmly so the dough won't dry out.
 Remember to put the pot in a place that is neither too warm nor too cold. A temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) will be perfect. If the dough doubles in size or you poke a hole in it and it doesn't collapse, then the fermentation process is complete.
 Knead the dough while adding a filling of your choice until you can't smell the sour flavor. Then, tear off a small ball of dough and bake it on the hearth. When it's done, tear it up. If it doesn't appear yellow inside, then the dose of filling is correct.
 Cut the dough log into any shape you want while adding a little bit of flour to it. You can also mold the mantou into many shapes.
 Make sure to leave a bit of space between them. After the water has boiled in the steamer, put the steam tray into the steamer and begin to steam. The steaming time depends on the size of the mantou, which generally takes about one hour for a normal portion.
