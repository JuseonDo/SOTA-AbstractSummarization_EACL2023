remember to save the moves you use to show a boy you really like them just for the boy you want to like you.

@summary
always look clean and well presented: shower, brush your hair or put it up, wear deodorant and clean clothes that look good on you and you feel comfortable in.

@summary
be confident when you interact with the boy you like: confidence is like the magic word that makes every girl gorgeous.

@summary
look at him when he talks to you: if you look at the ground, the walls, your friends, or another boy, he's not going to think you are interested- in fact he'll know you're not interested, because you're too busy checking out the wall!,

@summary
greet him appropriately: if you've been talking for a while, don't be afraid to walk up to him just to say hey.

@summary
don't try to be someone you're not, because guys always like the real girls better: don't lie about what you've done, who you know, or who you are.

@summary
don't refrain from starting conversations!,

@summary
most importantly, have fun!

 You should be kind and friendly to everyone of course so you'll need to make an extra effort with the boys you really want to like you, or maybe even consider to be boyfriend material.;
, If you choose, apply a subtle amount of make up, like a little mascara or a bit of eyeliner to bring attention to your eyes, and maybe just a bit of lip gloss. Generally, lipsticks or heavy eye-shadows are not very attractive on younger girls - just make sure whatever you put on is neat, evenly applied, and UN-smudged. Guys will always notice if you're wearing too much make up, or if it's messy or lopsided. Looking good isn't flirting though. To make your appearance part of your appeal to a boy, you need to make him think you have done it just for him, for example, pat your lips with a tissue before to speak to him. He'll think you just put that lipstick on for him, even if you aren't wearing any!

, Try not to be negative about yourself all the time - and never do it in front of a guy, unless you know how to joke about it. Guys are uncomfortable around girls who go on and on about how fat and ugly they are, and don't like hanging out with them.

, It shows that you're confident and social, and that you're genuinely interested. If you're still just getting his attention and he doesn't really know you so well, simply smile if he looks at you when you pass in the hallway- take steps forward if you want, present yourself and be outgoing. The boy doesn't always have to make the first move.
 This will just complicate things more, and things will be ruined if he ever finds out you're a fake.
 Sometimes guys can be shy and if you start a conversation it will feel good to him knowing that you are interested. Â If you always let him do the talking he may think your not interested and he's talking into a brick wall.
 This is middle school, you're not getting married. Flirting isn't a major commitment. And if he asks you out, great! If not, so what?
