 On gas stoves with gas marks for heat, this is usually around 6.;
, The butter should be roughly centimeter large cubes. This will make it easier to mix in later on.


Chill your butter in the refrigerator or freezer for 20 to 30 minutes beforehand so it is easier to manage.
 When measuring flour, use a sift or stir the flour quickly with a fork to break up large chunks and get an accurate measurement.
 Toss the chilled butter to coat it in flour. Then take two knives and literally cut into the mixture with crisscrossing motions. Think of cutting an "X" into the butter and flour with the two knives. The butter should be about the size of peas when you are done.


You can also lightly massage the butter and flower with your fingertips, or you can use a pastry blender, which looks like 4 to 5 wire arches attached to a handle., Mix together the ingredients so that they are evenly distributed, and then stop. Over mixing can lead to starchy or tough cakes.
 Mix together to form a stiff dough.


If you are having trouble adding mixing the dough, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk to thin it out.
 Using either cooking spray or a small pat of butter, grease a baking tray to prevent the rock cakes from sticking.


You can also cut a piece of parchment paper and use it to line the baking tray.
 Using a spoon, drop a dollop of dough onto the greases baking tray. Remember–these are rock cakes, so they don't have to be pretty to look like rocks.
 Check the cakes occasionally to make sure they are not burning. They are done when the outsides are firm and golden brown.
