@article
 More of the pulp is broken down through blending, and it is left in the juice rather than getting strained out.
 Any pulp that fell from the core can remain in the liquid, but the core itself and the seeds should be removed.
 Do not worry about straining it first, and wipe up any juice that spills with paper towels.
 Try a combination of vanilla and nutmeg, or a mix of sugar, ginger, and lime.
 Blend for several minutes. The pulpy liquid should be smooth and creamy by the time you finish.
 Pour in 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) at a time. Blend again.
 Refrigerate any extra juice for up to a week.
