;
, To husk the corn, just grab it at the top of the ear where you see the silks (the dark, hair-like strands) and pull it all the way down the corn.
 Rinse it under cool water to remove any foreign material.
 Add one tablespoon of sugar to the water to slightly sweeten the corn.
 Gently lower the corn into the water.
 This should take no more than a minute.
 To test it, place a fork in the corn to see if it's tender while it's boiling.
 Place the corn on a plate.
 Cover the corn with 3 tablespoon (44.4Â ml). of butter and season it with salt and pepper to taste.
