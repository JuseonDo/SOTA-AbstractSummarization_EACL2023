 Think about what your cat can do––will he be able to swim? Put him in Riverclan. Will he prefer shadows and hunting at night? Put him in Shadowclan. Can he be loyal and trustworthy? Put him in Thunderclan. Is he close to Starclan, and is he fast? Put him in Windclan. Choose any clan you want. You could also make up your own clan.,
