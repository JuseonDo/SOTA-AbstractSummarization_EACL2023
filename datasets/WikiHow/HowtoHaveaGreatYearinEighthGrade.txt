 Stick with friends and find something that you like to do. Find new games, and ask your gym teacher if he/she will try to learn it so you can play it in gym!;
, Pack it cutely. Put it in a decorated bag with your sandwich cut with cookie cutters. If you don't pack a lunch, don't forget money to load up your lunch account.
 If you don't find anybody, it's not the end of the world! Obviously if there's no one nice enough to sit next to, no one will care you're sitting alone!

, Since you are an eighth grader, you finally get dibs on the back seat. (If you don't ride with the high schoolers!)

, Most schools give out agendas. Use them! If they don't, get a notebook and write the date at the top with all of your homework. You'll be more organized if you do!

, Get involved in a sport or activity! If you aren't very athletic, but want to be part of a sport, try volleyball! School volleyball isn't that hard. If you like hitting people, try baseball or football. If you like getting attention, try cheerleading or spirit/pep squad.
 For guys, the best thing is to just be nice to the special lady and never ever joke on her or let your friends do the talking. For girls, just be yourself, talk to the guy, and try hard to not let your friends do the talking either. It will give the impression that you are not confident.
 This is eighth grade. If your school has graduation or a dance, go all out. Your school may even have a middle school prom. Buy a nice dress-who cares if you'll only wear it once! Go on all the field trips and have a blast.
 It is common for someone who is at the top to pick on someone at the bottom, but don't be one of those people. Be nice to the sixth and seventh graders and offer to help them out instead of making fun of them for being "lower" than you.
 This is your last year of middle school, so it's important to make lasting friendships.
 Prepare as much as possible; it may appear harder than you thought.
