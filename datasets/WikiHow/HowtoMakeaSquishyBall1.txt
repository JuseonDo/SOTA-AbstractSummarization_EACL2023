 Using fabric marker, draw two circles or ovals on the fabric. Cut out the circles or ovals.

You can vary the shape but it the shape is too complicated, you may not be able to turn the ball insideÂ out later.;
, Thread a needle with some cotton in a similar color to the cloth. Sew along the edge of the ball, leaving a small edge. Use small, close stitches to keep the filling inside., Turn the cloth inside out., Continue sewing together, making sure that the edges of the cloth are tucked inward while sewing, so they cannot be seen when you finish., It needs to be strong enough to prevent the fabric from unraveling., You can add buttons, beads or other decorations but not too much. Or, just leave it plain., It can now be played with.
