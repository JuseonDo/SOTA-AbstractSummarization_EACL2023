@summary
select two wooden poles or planks.

@summary
use an electric drill to drill a 1/4-inch (6 1/3-milliliter) hole in each pole.

@summary
lie the two poles flat on the ground.

@summary
loosely fix the two poles together with a carriage bolt.

@summary
open the two poles so that the bottoms are 3 feet (1 meter) apart.

@summary
tightly screw the wing nut onto the carriage bolt.

@summary
repeat the above steps with another two poles of equal dimensions.

@summary
place your "a" legs 4 feet (1 1/4 meters) apart from one another.

@summary
fix another 4-foot (1 1/4 meters) pole to the top point of both "a" stands.

@summary
fix another 4-foot (1 1/4 meters) pole about 6 inches (15 1/4 centimeters) down from the top of the lower legs.

@summary
fix another 4-foot (1 1/4 meters) pole about six inches up from the bottom of the lower legs.

@summary
repeat the netting-bar steps on the upper legs.
@article
 The poles should both be 4 feet (1.2 meters) long with a square 1-inch by 1-inch (2.5 by 2.5 centimeters) face.;
, The hole should be centered and positioned 2 inches (5 centimeters) down from the top of each piece.
 The holes should overlap so that you can see straight through to the ground if you look through them.
 The bolt should hold the two poles together, temporarily acting as a hinge.
 Keep the poles lying flat on the ground.
 The two poles should now be fixed in place, forming the first "A" set of legs for your frame.
 These other two poles should form another "A" set of legs.
 The "A" shape should not be flat or parallel to the ground. Instead, the "A" should be perpendicular to the ground, with one leg flat on the ground while the other points up and out.
 This fifth pole should connect the legs together. Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to hold them together.
 The lower legs are the legs currently resting on the ground. Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to hold them together. This creates a top bar to fix your netting to.
 Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to hold them together. This creates a lower bar to fix your netting to.
 The upper legs are those currently off the ground. Use a power drill and heavy-duty screws to fix the netting bars onto the legs.
