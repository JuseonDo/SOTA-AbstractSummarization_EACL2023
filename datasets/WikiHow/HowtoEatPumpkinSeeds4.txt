@summary
know that many people prefer to eat pumpkin seeds whole, along with the shell.

@summary
pry the pumpkin shell open and get at just the seed.

 If you toast or roast your pumpkin seeds to perfection, the outer shells don't really need to be removed in order to enjoy the seed inside, although some people like doing this.
 In order to do this:









Hold the pumpkin seed in your hand or pop into your mouth
Crack the side of pumpkin shell in half using your teeth, like you would a sunflower seed
Get at the inner seed and discard the outer shell
