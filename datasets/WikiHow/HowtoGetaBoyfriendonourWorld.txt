, Cake Mania, Flo's Diner, Buzz, etc. You can also go to a singles event.
, Using faces likeÂ ;) or 8-) can help him realize that you have an interest in him. If he winks back, he likes you! If you keep the conversation going, you're doing a good job, but know that if he starts answering with one-worded answers, then he might not be interested. Know when to stop.
