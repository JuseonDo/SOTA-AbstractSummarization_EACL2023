 When the oil is hot, add the onion, celery and capsicum. Saute for about 1 minute and then add garlic. Stir well to avoid burning.;

Avoid crushing the chickpeas. If they fall in half, it's no problem, but the texture of whole chickpeas is more desirable.
 You will want the consistency of a sauce: not too soupy and not too dry. If you find that it has dried out a little, or you had to wait for something else to cook, add a little more water, as it will soon be absorbed.
 Rice is a good accompaniment, but cumin roast potatoes really make it a meal.
