 The quickest way to download Pandora tracks is to use Chrome and its built-in development tools. You can do this with a premium account or without logging in.
 The developer tools sidebar will open.
 This will display network activity for the website.
 This will sort the results by size, starting with the largest files.
 This will clear out all of the network content so you can get a fresh start.
 You should see entries start appearing in the Network tab.
 This is the song file for the Pandora song you are currently listening to.
 A new Chrome tab will open with a black background and the audio file playing in the built-in audio player.
 You'll be able to give the file a name and choose where you want to save it.
 The files will save in M4A format, which you can play in iTunes or VLC Player, or you can convert it to MP3 format. See Convert MP4 Files to MP3 for details.
