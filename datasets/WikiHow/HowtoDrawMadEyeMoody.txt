 Keep it greying and wild. Try to keep it angling backwards as though wind is blowing it that way. Draw the basic outline of the head. Try to keep the skull shape uneven and bumpy, with a prominent chin.;
, Draw a curved, ugly nose with flaring nostrils and a small chunk of his nose missing at the tip. Draw a wavering line connected with another line to form the gap that is the mouth. Draw a short line below the forehead and add a small, beady brown eye in one corner. Connect a line going from the eye to the top of the nose. Add an eyepatch with a big, electric blue eye staring out of a hole in the centre of the eyepatch. Draw the thick neck and add faint scars all over Moody's face.
 Draw lines along the cloak to resemble wrinkles. Then draw a long sleeve draping down at the end with a hand clutching a wand at the end.
 Add a stained, golden, circular buckle. Draw two thick black bands coming down from under the cloak. These will be the tops of the legs.
 Draw a boot continuing the rest of the leg. Make the top of the boot as high as you need to.
 End the leg in a long, clawed foot. Add Moody's shadow below.
 Don't forget to draw Moody's hip-flask in his belt!
