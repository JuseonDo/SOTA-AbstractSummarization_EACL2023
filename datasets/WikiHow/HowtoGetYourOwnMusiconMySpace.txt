, Myspace will first ask you to sign in/sync your Facebook and Twitter account, but it should be fine if you don't have one or the other. They will ask for your email address and a little personal information. Insert that in. Don't forget to choose a username that you like and a safe password.
 If you can, try recording high quality. It makes it much more pleasant to listen to.
, Don't give up on the project! Make more and more tracks and keep uploading them! You never know when you may succeed.
 Reply to questions and keep your listeners engaged or else they may not come back for more.
