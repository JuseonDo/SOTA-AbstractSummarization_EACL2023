 Although a smile may not be much, just making eye contact is the start. Practice a sweet, pretty smile in the mirror, and as soon as you see him, look him in the eyes and give a nice, natural smile. Keep doing this (don't be disappointed if he doesn't smile back - you know how boys are!) until you feel ready for the next step.;
, Make sure you look (and smell!) your best, and make sure your breath is minty and fresh. But most importantly, keep calm and natural. Take a few sips of water to calm yourself down, and breath in and out slowly - but make sure you only do this before you bump into each other so you don't make a big thing of it.
 When you see him, look him in the eye, smile naturally, and say clearly "Hi (their name)", or if you don't know their name (it's probably best if you do so they know you are talking to them), just smile and say hello. You could even wave without saying anything if you wanted to.
 Just keep it natural and keep greeting him! Take some time to be proud of your first step to...love!!! Well done!
