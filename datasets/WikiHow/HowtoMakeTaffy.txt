 Rub a small amount of butter around to coat the inside surface of the pan. Set it aside.;
, Add corn syrup, water, butter, and salt, then stir to combine.
 Put the saucepan over medium heat and stir until butter melts.
 Once the mixture reaches a boil stop stirring.
 Cook without stirring and check the temperature on the thermometer until the candy reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit.


If you don't have a candy thermometer you can still check the doneness. Drop a bit of the mixture into cold water. If the candy makes a ball that holds its shape but is still flexible, it's ready.
 It will take some time for the candy to get to 250 degrees, but once it does it will overcook quickly.
 When it reaches the desired temperature you'll want to pull it off the heat fast.
 Add the vanilla and powdered flavoring and stir until they are well combined.
 The candy will cool in the baking pan.
, Putting butter on your hands will prevent the taffy from sticking to them.
 Use your buttered hands to pull the taffy until the color looks lighter and has a satiny appearance.This should take about 15 minutes.
 Once the taffy looks lighter pull it into long strips.
 Use scissors to cut the taffy into squares. Butter the scissors to make the cutting easier.
 Wrapping each piece of taffy in a piece of waxed paper will help it hold its shape.
