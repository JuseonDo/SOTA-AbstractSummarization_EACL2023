Type out or copy and paste the text into the cell. It may not appear to completely fit, but, even if the complete entry is not visible within the cell, it is still there.



Check the "Wrap Text" option on the Alignment tab of the "Format Cells" window and then click the OK button to close the window.



The cell is not large enough if the text appears to be cut off.
Enlarge the entire row in which the cell is located by clicking in between the row numbers and dragging down until all text is displayed.
Add more cells to the original set of merged cells to enlarge the cell. Click the original merged cell and drag either down or to the right to highlight additional cells. Right-click on the highlighted group of cells and choose the "Format Cells" option.
Note the grayed out check in the "Merge Cells" box. Uncheck and recheck until the mark is no longer gray.
