 Lipomas are generally harmless, but there is a very small chance that you may have liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are lumps that are similar to lipomas, but they grow rapidly, are painful, and do not move under the skin.Your doctor will diagnose you with a biopsy, MRI or CT scan if he thinks you have liposarcoma., Most lipomas are surgically removed or extracted. Scarring and bruising are possible side effects. Recurrences are not common.Liposuction is another treatment method. A needle and large syringe is used to remove the fatty tissue.Lipomas can be shrunken with steroid injections. This does not eliminate the lipoma, but it does reduce the lipoma before surgery.
