, Spray non-sticking cooking spray in the liners before. This will help the cupcakes not stick to the liners when they are ready to peel and eat!

, In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the dry ingredients with a whisk or wooden spoon until fully combined. Set aside.
 You can use a whisk for speedier mixing, or a regular eating spoon for quick stirs as well. Stir until the buttermilk and cherry juice are combined well. Set aside.
 With an electric mixer, cream the softened butter and sugar. Add the vanilla and almond extract as you are blending. Blend.
 One at a time, add each egg white. Place your electric mixer on high to combine the egg whites with the creamed mixture. Pour the cherry mixture and flour mixture into the batter. Blend on high speed until mixed well. Set aside.
 Use an ice cream scoop or spoon for easy pouring-in. Fill more than halfway till the top, but not too high as the cupcakes can collapse while baking. About 3 tablespoons for each cupcake wrapper is enough.
 To test if cupcakes are done, poke a toothpick in the middle of one cupcake. If the toothpick comes out dry, the cupcakes are ready. If it comes out wet with cupcake batter, have the cupcakes bake for an additional five minutes. Once done, have cupcakes cool on a plate or wire rack.
 Using your favorite canned or homemade frosting recipe, frost the cupcakes using a frosting pipe. Decorate the cupcakes with cherries, red sprinkles, or powdered sugar. Serve.
