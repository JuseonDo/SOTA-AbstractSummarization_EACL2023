 To find the area of a circle in square inches, all you need to know is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge in inches. This distance is called the circle's radius. Once you find this number, simply substitute it for "r" in the equation above. Multiply it by itself, then multiply it by the mathematical constant pi (3.1415926...) to determine the square inches within the circle.
 A triangle's base is simply the length of one of its sides,while its height is the distance from the "base" side to the opposite corner when measured at a 90 degree angle from the "base" side. The area of a triangle can be calculated using base and height measurement for any of its three sides and the opposite corner.
 Appropriately, the way to calculate a parallelogram's area in square inches is similar to the way to calculate a rectangle's - simply multiply a parallelogram's base by its height with both measurements in inches. Its base is the length of one of its sides, while its height is the distance from the opposite side to the first side when measured at a right angle.
 A trapezoid is a four-sided shape with one set of parallel sides and one set of non-parallel sides. To calculate its area in square inches, you must take three measurements (in inches): The length of the longer parallel side ("B"), the length of the shorter parallel side ("b"), and the trapezoid's height ("h") - the distance between the two parallel sides, measured at a right angle. Multiply these three measurements by each other, then half the result to find the trapezoid's area in square inches.
