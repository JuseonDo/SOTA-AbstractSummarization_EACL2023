, The milk should not be ultrapasteurized and the kettle should have a heavy bottom., Stir it frequently to keep it from scorching., Do this as soon as the milk boils. The milk should separate into curds and whey at this point. If it doesn't then add more vinegar, one tablespoon at a time, until you see the milk solids turn into curds that swim in the thin greenish blue whey.,, of very fine sea salt., Press it a bit with your hands to get rid of the excess whey.,,, Enjoy this tasty farm cheese right away or store it in the fridge for up to a week.
