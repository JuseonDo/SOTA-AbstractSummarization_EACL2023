@summary
gather the materials required and construct the circuit from the circuit diagram.

@summary
get some banana leads and connect the +12v and -12v outputs from your modded atx supply and connect it to the input of your variable module.

@summary
once you have built the circuit test it carefully and measure the output voltage.
@article
 It would be a good idea to get the datasheet for the regulator from the manufacturers website.;
, Use a multimeter to measure the output voltage.
 You should be able to vary the voltage from about 1.5V up to 22V by turning the variable resistor. If you are using the LM317 the output current will be restricted to 1.5A, if using the LM338K it should be slightly higher check the datasheet for exact information.
