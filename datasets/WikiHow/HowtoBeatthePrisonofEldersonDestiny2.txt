 If you complete the level 28, you will be able to complete the next parts of the PoE: level 32, 34, and 35. Make sure you have assembled your fire-team and you are prepared on gear, weapons, and ammo., Press A (Xbox) or X (PlayStation) on any Prison of Elders challenge. If you already completed level 28, there is no reason to do it again., The rounds are the same, but more intense. Be sure to have a headset and prepare for the five rounds, six if facing Skolas.,,
