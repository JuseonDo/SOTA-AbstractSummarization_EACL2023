 Instead, their skin dries up within minutes of handling. Get a large aquarium. Fill it with about a water bottle full of water. Make sure the water stays clean and is changed regularly. Bottled water (NOT distilled) is best.;
, Put a screen on top of it, so they can breathe.


We've covered the basic. Now on to the harder care.
 Tree frogs originate in tropical regions, and are used to either type. Getting bark/sand from a pet store is best because it is sifted and is sure not to have any chemicals or harmful agents. Do not use garden potting soil, as there are chemicals in it that will make your frog sick!

, Frogs love to climb, so make sure there are plenty of places for them to jump and climb on. They are also nocturnal, so a dark place to sleep in the daytime is important. Try flipping a plastic bowl upside down (Chinese take-out bowls work well) and cutting a small door in the side.
 In nature, tree frogs have a wide diet. This includes bugs such as crickets, which are found worldwide. Go out at about dawn or dusk. This is when the crickets are most active, and easiest to catch. Crickets are also available at pet stores and are pretty inexpensive. It is good to dust the crickets with some calcium powder (from the pet store) once a week to help your frog's bones stay strong. UV (sun) light also helps with this. Some frogs will also eat meal worms, earth worms, or even pinkie mice!

, It will give them nourishment to pass on to the frogs, and will also prevent them from nibbling on the frogs backs when they get hungry.
, Maybe you can find your frog's fave food.
 They are scared of you.
