 It can either be a classic kung fu fight like the Bruce Lee or Matrix movies or Krav Maga like Bourne Ultimatum or Boxing like Rocky.;
, If you are shooting a kung fu fight, make sure the person can pull off high kicks and knows at least a couple of takedowns, etc. If he doesn't, get someone who has trained in the art to teach him

, Create pauses in the fight after every few seconds and register the fighters expressions by zooming into his face etc.Get your fighter to make funny wah wah or "hiyah" sounds . It adds to the feel of the fight.
 Only boxing punches in a fight is really boring.Include the high kicks frequently,the takedown now and then.Do not just show one person getting beaten up. Include blocks,parries,rolls and weapons if possible

, You can show cool kicks in slow motion or speed up Punches to make it look like Bruce Lee

, Choose a suitable setting and make sure the fight is performed throughout the setting for eg if you choose to include a staircase on the setting or a swimming pool. Make part of the fight take place on the staircase or in the water
