@article
 Talk to someone you trust, as they will play a key role in your recovery. Tell this person that you need their help.;
, If it's there, you will feel more urge to go on it. Put it in a public room, where many people can access it.
 Have your trusted friend help enforce these hours. Start out with a cutback of about an hour, and keep that plan for about 10 days.
,, Read a book, do housework, play with the dog, cook, but don't just sit and wait til you are allowed. It will increase your feelings of needing the internet.
 For example, no computer before school or work, and not after 11PM, with a 3 hour daily maximum timeframe. If everyone follows these rules, it'll feel like nothing!
