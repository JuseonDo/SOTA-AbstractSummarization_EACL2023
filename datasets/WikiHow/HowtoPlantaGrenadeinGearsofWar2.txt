 Any grenade will work (either frag, smoke or ink grenades), although frag grenades work the best due to their large damage radius.;
,, If you are aiming at the surface correctly, you should have successfully planted a grenade. If the grenade does not stick the first time, try again. If it still doesn't stick, then it may be a surface which doesn't support grenade planting.
 Grenades have a much larger blast radius in Gears of War 2, so if an opponent sets it off while you're near, you'll likely be killed too. Planted grenades can take down most opponents, so just watch and wait - you've successfully planted a grenade.
 Sure anyone can plant a grenade, but if you want to take down enemies, then you'll need to predict which areas they'll walk through, if you'll need more than one grenade planted and what kind to plant. See the tips section for more help on ways to maximize grenade planting damage.
