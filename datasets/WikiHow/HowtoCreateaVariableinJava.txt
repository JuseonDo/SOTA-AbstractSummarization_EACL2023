@summary
create a simple java program.

@summary
scroll to a place where you want to insert the variable.

@summary
create the variable.

@summary
understand how this works.

@summary
protect variables from being edited later, optionally, by adding "final type name" between the parentheses in the second line of your code (public static void main).
@article
 An example is provided called Hello.java :




public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World!");



;
, Remember: If you place a variable in the main class, you can reference it anywhere. Choose the type of variable you need.


Integer data types : Used to store integer values like 3, 4, -34 etc

byte
short
int
long


Floating Point data type : Used to store numbers having fractional part like 3.479

float
double


Character data type: Used to store characters like 's', 'r', 'g', 'f' etc

char


Boolean data types : Can store either of the two values: true and false

boolean


Reference data types : Used to store references to objects

Array types
Object types like String



, Here are examples of how to create and assign a value to each type.


int someNumber = 0;






double someDouble = 635.29;






float someDecimal = 4.43f;






boolean trueFalse = true;






String someSentence = "My dog ate a toy";






char someChar = 'f';







, It is basically "type name = value".



final int someNumber = 35; Adding the 'final' here means that the variable 'someNumber' cannot be changed later
