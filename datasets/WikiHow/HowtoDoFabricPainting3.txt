 It is helpful to try out different color combinations on this template before transferring it to your fabric.
 For dark fabrics, you can use a white chalk pencil to trace your design.









Opt for tracing a stencil if you want to follow a precise, pre-made pattern or picture. Tape your stencil down with masking tape to prevent it from moving.
You can also free-form draw on your fabric before you paint if you are confident enough in your artistic ability.
 Be sure to cover the outline with paint so that it doesn't show through.
 Dip a relatively thin brush in the mixture and paint brush strokes in a horizontal motion.









Spray water lightly on the fabric surface using a mister bottle after painting to allow the brush strokes to bleed lightly while switching between colors.
If the paint begins to bleed too much or too quickly, grab a hair dryer and dry the spot to stop the process.
 Fabric spray paint dries more quickly than other types of fabric paint and allows you to easily fill in intricate stencils.
 You can add variation and create depth simply by combing paint in small sections. Be careful not to blend undesirable colors together.
