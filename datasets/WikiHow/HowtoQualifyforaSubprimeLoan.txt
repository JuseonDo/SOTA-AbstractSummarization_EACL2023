prepare to be asked by the lender for additional documentation, explanation and/or proof of your ability to repay the loan.

 Ask about their rates and fees, and their cash with the subprime loan, then choose the lender you are most comfortable making a loan application with.;
, This should include:


Proof of income. Provide 2 month's worth of pay stubs, direct deposit statements and/or anything else that could count as your monthly income.
Bank statements. This includes checking, savings and money market accounts, and is necessary to prove you have the money for a down payment and closing costs. In some instances, when you cannot provide documentation to prove your income (self-employed, retired, etc.), you may be able to use bank statements to prove cash flow.
Monthly expenses. Your subprime mortgage lender will want to see at least 2 month's worth of timely payments on all utility bills, rent/mortgage and credit accounts.
, Getting a subprime loan approval is not an exact science and you may have to go back to the drawing board several times before your package is considered credit-worthy by the lender.
