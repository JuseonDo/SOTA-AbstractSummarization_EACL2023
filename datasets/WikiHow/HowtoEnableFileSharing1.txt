 You can share any folder on your Windows 10 system with other users on your local network. When you press this key combination, a search box will appear.;
, Now you’ll see the Control Panel.
 This link appears just beneath the “Network and Internet” header in the main pane.,,, Now that File Sharing is enabled, you can share a folder on your system.
 The File Explorer will open on your desktop.
 You’ll need to select a folder to share rather than an individual file. Use the navigation pane on the left side of Explorer to browse for the folder.
, Since the folder is not yet shared, you’ll see “Not Shared” just below its name under “Network File and Folder Sharing.”

, The contents of this window are mostly grayed-out.
,, Now you’ll set the permissions for all users on the network who will access the folder., When this group is selected, you’ll be able to change everyone on the network’s permissions for this folder at once.


If you’d rather just share the folder with one person, click “Add” and then select the person’s username from the list. Then, click to select that user.
 Place checks next to “Allow” or “Deny” for each of the following options:


Full Control: Allows everyone to read, delete, and edit files in this folder. This also grants this user the ability to change permissions on the folder.
Change: Allows everyone to read, delete, and edit files in the folder but not change permissions.
Read: Allows everyone to view files in the folder and run programs. Users cannot change files in the folder if this is the only option allowed.
 The folder is now shared.
