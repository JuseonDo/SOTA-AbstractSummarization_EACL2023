 Raw wool or fleece can be purchased direct from a sheep farm, or, if you have your own sheep, use your own fleece.;
, The pot should be large enough to contain all the wool. It might be easier to do this outdoors over an open fire if you have a large amount of fleece.
 Push the wool into the water gently. Pieces of wool can be placed in mesh laundry bags to prevent them from breaking apart.
, Keep the wool boiling over a period of several hours. During this time, keep an eye on the boiling water and add more water as it evaporates off. Do not leave unattended as the water could boil off and burn the wool.
, Do this using a pair of tongs or large slotted spoons.
 The remaining substance is lanolin.
 This will remove any impurities. Pour it into a bowl and leave to cool. Once cooled, scrape off the lanolin and place into sterilized jars. The lanolin is ready to use.
