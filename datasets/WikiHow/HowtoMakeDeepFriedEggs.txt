 Some of the things are listed below under "Things You'll Need". It is important to have everything ready because the cooking process happens very quickly and you don't want to overcook the eggs while looking for something missing.


Set up the drainage area and slotted spoon now.;
, Heat over a high heat. The temperature should read 190ºC/375ºF or close about.
 When doing this, take care not to break the yolk.
, Be very careful with this step to avoid splashing any hot oil onto yourself.
 It should take on an oval shape and you'll only see white, with the yolk safely tucked away inside. Continue doing this for 1 minute.


You may find it easiest to use two wooden spoons to do the turning or rolling around of the egg.
 The deep fried egg is ready when it looks set and has a light color to it. Once you see the white turning to brown, that's the time to remove the deep fried egg.
 Do this quickly, as the egg must be served before it loses its airiness (which happens rather quickly).
 Add salt, pepper or other condiments as wished prior to eating. Serve as quickly as possible and enjoy what is quite a luxurious treat.


The deep fried egg goes well on freshly made toast. Place it on a plate, as the yolk will run gooey.
Try serving it on top of grilled cheese on toast. Quite an experience!
Serve on top of croutons with cooked tomato pieces.
