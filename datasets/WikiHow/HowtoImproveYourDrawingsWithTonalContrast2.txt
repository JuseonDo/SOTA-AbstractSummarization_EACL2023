important - you don’t need all these tones - 1 to 10 - in a drawing, but you do need the lightest, no.

@summary
look at pure white tone no 1 for a minute.

beginners often make a superb tonal scale, but somehow are afraid to re-create that darkest tone on their actual drawings.

 Try to see which tones in your drawing match the tones on the scale. Important - use your scale, not the one here! If you think your drawing lacks something, probably the only tones you can match are in the middle range, say 4 to 6. So what does this tell you? To give your drawing dynamism, you must be able to see the dark tones - whether it’s 8, 9 or 10 on your tonal scale, it needs to have, somewhere, the darkest, strongest tone you can make. It often only needs to be a small area that has this darkest tone, but it makes all the difference to the result.
, 1, the darkest, No 10 (or whatever it is on your scale), and one or two in the middle range - say 4 and 6. Don’t be too worried about the middle ranges, they usually look after themselves -it’s the lightest and darkest which seem to cause problems, and that's the purpose of this exercise - to make you aware of them.
 Although it’s vital, somehow it doesn’t cause a anything like the anxiety to beginners that the dark tones do!

, “I’m scared!” is a common cry…Well, it’s a sheet of paper - you won’t kill anyone or drown or cause an accident - so just do it!
