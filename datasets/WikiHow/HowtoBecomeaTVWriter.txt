, You can write a concept, a full original script, or a "spec script". A "spec script" for television is a sample episode written for a current television program. This gives creative executives a feel for your talent and may encourage them to request more original projects from you, or even consider you for a job as a writer's assistant or staff writer.
,, Also ensure that you have "proof-of-creation" for the project.
 Do not make unsolicited submissions of your project to companies. Ask for referrals, or direct permission to submit your project to production companies.
 This is the most common route to working as a TV Writer. You can find job listings within the industry online.
 If you're serious, get professional help. Google 'professional TV advisors' and get the experts to assess your work, steer you to the right production companies and make the right introductions, otherwise you'll spend a lifetime 'door-knocking'!,
