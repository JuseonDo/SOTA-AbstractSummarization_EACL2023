 The fish wait for sand fleas, also called mole crabs, and other small crustaceans to be washed off the beach and carried to them by the wave action. This puts them in easy reach of anglers who prefer to fish from the beach or a pier.;
, Add a pyramid weight sufficient to keep your bait from returning to shore with the waves. You may need a bigger rod when the surf is heavy.
 Sand fleas are the pompano's favorite food and are readily available in areas where pompano are.


Look for v-shaped eddies when the waves roll off the beach. These are where sand fleas have washed ashore and are digging into the sand. Collect the sand fleas in a dry bucket.
If you can't find any sand fleas, it's likely that you won't catch any pompano. Move to a location where sand fleas are plentiful.
Pompano will eat other crustaceans, like shrimp, and even on occasion small bait fish.
