 Facebook Messenger is a blue speech bubble icon with a white lightning bolt in it.
 It's the icon that looks like a house, and it appears at the top left corner just under the search bar.
 Doing so will reveal a pop-up menu.
 The conversation will be moved to the "Archived" folder.
 It's in the bottom-right corner of the screen, and doing so will start a new conversation.
, You will now see the archived messages from the conversation appear in the chat window.
