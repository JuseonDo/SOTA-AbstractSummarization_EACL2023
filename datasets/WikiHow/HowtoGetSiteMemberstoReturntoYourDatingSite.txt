This strategy works because people see that there is activity on your site, and all of the notifications contribute to the idea of them finding a partner.;
, For example: set up a theme and prompt your site users to send in their photographs and upload them into a photo gallery on the site where everybody else will be able to ‘like’ the photos.
The photo that receives the most votes will win a prize. You can grant the winner a premium membership, feature their profile on the site, send a real-life gift, and so on.
, It is a great way to grow the member database.
Also, when people have friends who are signed up on the same site, it can serve as an additional incentive for them to use the site to communicate with them.

Or try the opposite: attract prospects by promoting your dating site during offline events, such as speed dating parties, conferences, trade shows and exhibitions, or maybe even at airports.
 This can be custom t-shirts, mugs, posters, and so on. Since you are a dating site owner, you strive to help people build (romantic) relationships. Consider offering flower delivery or restaurant bookings as part of the service.
 If you’re into it, connect your site to horoscope RSS feeds to provide your site members with daily or weekly forecasts.
 Poll results can be a valid topic for another blog article.
 Holidays such as Valentine’s Day or Thanksgiving are great occasions for offering premium membership at better prices.


You can send out regular news digests, run a weekly tips and advice column, or share your thoughts on the world of dating along with success stories from your site members throughout the year.
