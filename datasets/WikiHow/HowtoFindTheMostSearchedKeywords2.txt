 Google Trends pulls together information on Google's most popular searches. You can use several tools to find popular keywords.
 Look for the 2 phrases: "Explore trends" and "Hot searches." They should be located in the upper left area of the screen.


You will need to sign into your Google account in order to access all of these features.
,, These are Google's most popular search terms, and they are usually an indication of popular pop culture, political news and other trending subjects.
 By staying on top of trending search engine topics, you can give your website new relevance.


Keep in mind that it will be difficult to use these trending keywords with PPC advertising. The best way to use them is to provide quality content that refers to trending topics. Use these keywords in your title, sub-title, URL, image names and articles to produce backlinks that Google gathers and uses to rank your website.
