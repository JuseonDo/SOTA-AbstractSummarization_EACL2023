@article
 Scrunch the pages up and stuff them inside a large plastic bag, such as a kitchen waste bag or a garbage bag.
 Arrange it so that it sits snugly in the middle of the papers.
 Alternatively, seal with a twist tie.
 A few days more won't hurt it.
 Do a sniff test to see whether the odor has gone. If not, return to the bag for a few more days. Eventually it should start to smell better.
