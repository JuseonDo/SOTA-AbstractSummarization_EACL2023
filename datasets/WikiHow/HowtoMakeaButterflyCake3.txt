 The important thing is to bake the cake in two 9 inch (22 cm) round cake pans. You will be able to make two butterfly cakes (or freeze one for later)., Remove the cakes from the pans and continue to cool the cakes completely., Cut the cake in half along the diameter with a bread knife. Separate the two halves., The piece you cut away should have sides of 1 1/2 in. (4 cm) in length., Place the pieces where the round edges are barely touching in the middle. This will form the butterfly wings., Go over the icing with a butter knife to smooth out the icing., Be sure that you keep the decorations on the butterfly wings symmetrical.

Place a straight candy stick in the middle of the cake to form the body of the butterfly.
Licorice or fruit roll ups make nice antennae.
You can sprinkle the entire cake with sugar when you finish to add a glittery touch to decorate the cake.
, Serve side by side if you want a pair of butterfly cakes or place at different ends of the table to serve more guests with ease.
