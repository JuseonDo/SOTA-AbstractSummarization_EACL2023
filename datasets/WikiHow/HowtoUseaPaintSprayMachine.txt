Airless spray paint machines are versatile enough for most paint jobs and are the choice of professional painters.
Air assist spray paint machines are used by woodworkers and automobile painters because they leave the best finish. They are the most expensive type of spray paint machine, however.
Hand-held electric cup machines are often purchased by homeowners for small jobs, but can be difficult to use. They require that the paint be thinned significantly, and can clog or spit paint.;
, The supplier should be able to provide you with a viscosity tester to help you determine whether your paint is thin enough to use in your spray paint machine.
 In general, small nozzles and lower pressures are best for thin paints such stains or enamels. Large nozzles and high pressures are needed for thicker paints, such as wall paint.



Hold the sprayer so the paint will exit horizontally and maintain a consistent distance of 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) from the surface. Keep your wrist stiff and move the sprayer in sweeping motions with your arm. To paint horizontal surfaces, such as ceilings, use a tip extension to redirect the paint.
Spray from left to right (or right to left if you're left-handed), pressing the trigger on the sprayer just before you arrive at the point where you want to lay down paint. Lay down about 3 feet (1 meter) of paint at a time.
Overlap the next application over your first by 50 percent so the surface will get 2 thin coats and won't dry into stripes of paint.
 Cover anything you don't want painted. Using a spray paint machine puts a lot of paint droplets in the air, which will drift away and settle on objects nearby, including plants, decks and cars if you are painting outdoors and on furniture, walls and floors in other rooms if painting indoors.
