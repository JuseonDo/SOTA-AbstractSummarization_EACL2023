@summary
calculate the distance to the object by multiplying the height (or width) of the object by 1000 then dividing by the number of mils that the object spans.

@summary
calculate as accurately as possible, and any "added error" (by yourself) is error in distance that may not be acceptable.

@summary
use a calculator if needed.

For example: a six foot tall object (2-yards) which is eight Mils in size is 250-yards away. 2 x 1000 / 8 = 250.


Sub-divide the Mil Dots as much as possible, and be as accurate in estimating the size of the object as possible.






The object is five feet (1.67-yards) wide and spans 2.8 Mils is 596-yards away.






A guess that the object is 2-yards instead of 1.67 would mean the estimation of over 100 yards difference which could mean a hit, or a miss of over five inches with a standard .308.






To be in the right mindset, calculate sizes of objects to the tenth of a yard (is that 3.4-yards or 3.5?). Calculate the span in Mils also to the tenth of a Mil. Both of these will take practice, but perfect estimations is the only way to get perfect range calculation.
 Some equations might get pretty complex, and accuracy is key, but the speed of a calculator may also help in some situations.
