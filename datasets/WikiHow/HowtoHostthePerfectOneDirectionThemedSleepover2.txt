You can split your guests into teams and enjoy this quiz.



You can have the large life size cut-outs of One Direction members around the room for special effects.
 You can chat and discuss your views on the boys.
 Select a particular member and ask about his favorite things.


For example, you can ask "What's his favorite color?" and encourage your guests to answer your questions.
 You can cut out pictures of One Direction from magazines, etc.
 No sleepover would be complete without this.
