 In that case, make sure you pick the most relevant topics.
 Then move on to time values, pitch, scales, time signature and so on. You don't need to explain complicated things like cadences or modes at this stage. Keep it as light and simple as possible. The deeper learning will come later when the student is more personally motivated and self-directed in the learning.
