@summary
toning can be done with a demi-permanent toner or purple shampoo, depending on what you want the hair to look like.

@summary
tone the hair every 2nd or 3rd wash. don't tone every wash because you will end up with colour buildup which will dull your hair colour a lot.
@article
 If you're using purple shampoo quickly apply a generous amount to your entire head (or areas bleached) and leave on for 2 minutes and rinse. Many say to leave on for 5 minutes, but often that's too long, so try 2 minutes and if further toning is needed you can re-apply.
 To keep it white you'll need to tone it when yellow and brassy tones emerge.
