 Take the following things into account:


Thickness: a thin shell may crack more easily, but a thicker shell is more difficult and takes longer.
Size: a large shell is easier to work with, but make sure you have the right size for your project.
Layers: some shells have layers that can crack off leaving a prettier layer underneath.;
, Make sure you have room for size of hole you want. Remember the closer to the edge the easier to crack.
, Be careful.
, Continue twisting vigorously until you reach the other side of the shell, twist for 5 more seconds then stop.
 If necessary, twist more times in the hole until you reach the desired size.
