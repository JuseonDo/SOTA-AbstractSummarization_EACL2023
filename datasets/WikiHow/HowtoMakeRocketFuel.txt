, Combine 100 g (3.22 oz.) of potassium nitrate (KN03), 50 g (1.61 oz.) of sugar, 18 g (0.58 oz.) of karo syrup and 80mL (5 tbs. or 1/3 cup) of distilled water in a saucepan.
, The mixture will turn clear when the cooking process is complete, which should take about 5 minutes. Wear protective gloves while cooking and handling the ingredients.
 Divide the mixture equally between the two pans. Form a pool of liquid in each pan, and avoid coating the inner sides of the pie pans.
 Wear gloves to protect your hands.
, Allow the rocket fuel to cool to approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) so it can be safely handled.
 Use a wooden stirrer or spoon to remove the fuel from the pans.
 Be sure to wear gloves. The rocket fuel may not readily stick together, so you may need to apply strong pressure to it.
 While the fuel is still warm, use your gloved hands to form shapes that will allow you to fit it into plastic containers.
 Seal the containers.
