, Take note that Jack is very thin and has pointy fingers.
 He has a bat-inspired bowtie and the bottom of his coat has five pointy tips at the back.
 He has eye sockets since he is already a skeleton. Draw an angle pointing upwards for the nose. Use vertical lines lined across a horizontal line for the mouth.
