 #*The first 8 inches (20.3Â cm) of the 30-inch piece of wood (the short piece) will be alongside the long piece of wood, and at a 90-degree angle. # Place the two pieces on the floor, with the 22-inch long "leg" pointing away from the ground, and carefully screw in three of the wood screws.


Each screw will enter into the long piece of wood at about 1/2-inch from the end and along the 8-inch surface, then all the way through the 3/4-inch surface of the long piece, then into the 1-inch surface of the short piece.
