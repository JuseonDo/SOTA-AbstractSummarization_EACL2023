You must have spent at least 73 days in 2 of the last 3 years in New Zealand before you are granted residence.



Do this if the Investor 1 category is not in your best interest. You must be age 65 or younger, meet minimum English language standards, and have been in New Zealand for at least 146 days in each of the last 3 years.
