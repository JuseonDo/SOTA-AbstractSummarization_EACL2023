The surgeon will meet up with you before they start surgery and go over the procedure in detail, should you have forgotten anything.
 You will probably be wheeled into the OR and transferred to an operating table, where anesthesia will be administered.
 You will feel groggy and dizzy. If you feel like you will fall over if you try to walk, don't attempt to. Have the nurse or the person that will be driving you home hold on to you as you walk.
