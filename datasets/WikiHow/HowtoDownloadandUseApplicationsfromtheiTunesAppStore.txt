, This will either turn your device on, or bring you directly to the lock screen.

, If you do not have a pass code, you will be taken directly to the home screen and therefore do not need to perform this step.
 To do this, click the "Settings" icon, then click the tab that says "Wi-Fi". If you are using an iPhone and are in the range of a cell tower, you should not need to have Wi-Fi turned on.
, There are many ways to do this. If you look at the bottom of the screen, there are five tabs. You can search for the Application, look in the top 25 free or paid applications, or look in the featured tab.
 This same button will then say "install". Tap it.
 If you do not have one, you will need to create one.
 You will be taken back to your home screen and your download should start immediately. You will be able to see the progress. Be patient. If this is a large file, it could take a while to download, especially if you are using the 1st generation iPhone with Edge.
 If you decide you do not like it you can always delete it.
