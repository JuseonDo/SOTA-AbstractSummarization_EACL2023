 There should be very little soil left. When it does need to be repotted, move it into a container that is no more than 1 inch larger than the old one.
 Put 1 inch of potting soil into the new container, gently remove the Hoya from its old container and set it in the new one.


Fill in around the roots with potting soil and water it generously to settle the soil and give it a good drink.
 The faded flowers can be snipped off with sharp scissors just below the flower.
