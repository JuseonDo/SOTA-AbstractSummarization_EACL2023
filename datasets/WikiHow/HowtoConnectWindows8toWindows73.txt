 In order to share printers, you'll need to enable sharing on the system level for the computer that has the printer installed.
 If you are using Category view, select "Network and Internet" and then click "Network and Sharing Center".
 This is located on the left side of the Network and Sharing Center.
 This is the profile for your Home network.
 This will enable the computer to share its installed printers with other computers on the network. Click the Save changes button.
 If you are in Category view, click the "View devices and printers" link.
 Don't select the "Properties" option, as it won't open the correct window.
 Check the "Share this printer box" and click Apply.
 Now that the printer has been shared, you can connect to it from the second computer.
 If you are in Category view, click the "View devices and printers" link.
, Select the newly-shared printer from the list and click Next to install the software. You can now select the printer when printing a document as long as the computer the printer is installed on is turned on and logged in.
