 It would be best to keep the lashes in their original tray. If the lash strip is very long, however, you might want to measure it against your eyelid, and trim off any excess; always trim from the outer corner.
 For best results, use a high-quality eyelash glue.If your eyelash glue comes with an applicator, you should use that. If your eyelash glue came in a tube, apply it using a thin brush., You can do this using your fingers or a pair of tweezers., If you apply the lashes too soon, the individual lashes may fall off.
