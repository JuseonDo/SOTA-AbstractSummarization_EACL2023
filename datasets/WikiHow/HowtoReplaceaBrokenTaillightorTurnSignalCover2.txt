You need a screwdriver and, depending on your vehicle, a standard (imperial) or metric deep-socket set. The socket set must have a ratchet wrench, extensions and an open wrench set.
Raise the hood and identify the connections or tie-down locations on the turn-signal, headlight and clearance light.
Disconnect all of the screwed down locations and nuts from the bolted sections.



This will give you access to the bulb holders for the turn signal, headlight and clearance light. You need to disconnect the turn signal cover from the individual bulb holders. There will most likely be three at the back of the broken lens, similar to changing any burned out bulb.
 Reconnect the turn signal, headlight and clearance light.
 For some vehicles, the turn-signal unit needs to be grounded to the metal body in order to work.
