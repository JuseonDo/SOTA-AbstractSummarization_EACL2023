 You will be carving the exact measurements into your pumpkin so you want precision.;
, The bottom third is a good area. Measure where you will place the teeth using the measurements you took.
 Although you have measurements you want the specific shape to fit snugly inside the pumpkin.
 You don’t need to remove the top first to extract seeds--smaller pumpkins like the mini’s don’t have an abundance of seeds so you should have a relatively hollow pumpkin.
 Simply wiping down the inside of the pumpkin should do the trick.
 Make sure the teeth fit snugly and there are no gaps between the teeth and the pumpkin.
 Push each red balled pin into the area above the mouth to give the effect of red, glowing eyes.
