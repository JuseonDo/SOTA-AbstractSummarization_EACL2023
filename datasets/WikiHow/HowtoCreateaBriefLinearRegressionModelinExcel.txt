locate the data marker for the mean at {1143.75,2.755} which will read "series 1 point 1143.75" (1143.75, 2.8) when you're hovering over it or have clicked on it.

@summary
return to the data worksheet to figure out the regression line of y' = mx + b, where m = the slope and b = the y-intercept.

@summary
select cell g1 and enter y.select cell h23 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=sum(h3:h22)" and format cells border black bold outline and copy it to i23.

@summary
select cell h24 and enter m and do format cells font color red.

@summary
copy cell h25 and paste it to cell i26 and enter into i26 y' - mx + b.

@summary
edit copy cell i26 to cell range h29:i29.

@summary
activate the chart worksheet and click in the chart and in the menu, do chart add data and in response to the range query, go back to the data worksheet and select cell range h30:i31.

@summary

 Save the workbook as Linear Regression - Brief Lesson, or something similar, into a logical file folder.;
, Recommended Settings: Set General to R1C1 Off and Show the 10 Most Recent Documents; Edit - set all the Top options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System. Display number of decimal places = blank (for integers preferred), Preserve display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff; View - show Formula Bar and Status Bar, hover for comments and all of Objects, Show gridlines and all boxes below that auto or checked; Chart - show chart names and data markers on hover. Leave rest unchecked for now; Calculation -- Automatically and calc before save, max change .000,000,000,000,01 w/o commas as goal-seeking is done a lot and save external link values and use 1904 system; Error checking - check all; Save - save preview picture with new files and Save Autorecover after 5 minutes; Ribbon -- all checked except Hide group titles and Developer.,, Enter the column headers of rows 2: A2: Student; B2 SAT; C2: GPA; D2: VARIANCE; E2: VARIANCE; F2: TREND, G2: Change., are their grades likely to rise, fall or remain about the same?, In {x,y} pairs as shown in the picture below Step 22, or as follows: for student 1, {X,Y} = {935 for X or SAT, 2.2 for Y or GPA}; student 2 {1260,3,1}; then {1105,2.6}; {1320,3.3}; {1450,3.8}; {960,2.2; {1360,3.2}; {900,2.2}; {1020,2.2}; {1380,3.6}; {940,2.3}; {1190,2.8}; {1000,2.2}; {945,2.3}; {990,2.4}; {1000,2.2}; {1040,2.3}; {1570,3.9}; {1530,3.8}; {980,2.4}., Input the formula w/o quotes into cell B23 "=AVERAGE(B3:B22)" and copy it and paste it to cell C23. Select cell C23 and Insert Name Define name Y_Bar for cell $C$23. Select cell B23 and Insert Name Define name X_Bar for cell $B$23. Select cell range B23:C23 and Format Cells Font color Red and Bold., Edit Go To cell range E3:E22 and with cell E3 the active and high-lighted cell, enter w/o quotes the formula "=(C3-Y_BAR)^2" and Edit Fill Down. Select cell range D3:D23 and do Format Cells Number Number Decimal places 4., Select cell range E3:E23 and do Format Cells Number Number Decimal places 6. Select cell A24 and enter VARIANCE and select cell B24 and input the formula "=D23" and copy it and paste it to cell C24. Select cell range B24:D25 and do Format Cells Number Number Decimal places 6., (for Standard Deviation) and select cell B25 and enter w/o quotes the formula "=STDEVPA(B3:B22)" and copy and paste it to cell C25. Do Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 7 for selected cell range B25:C25., That is the projection of one student's GPA given an SAT of 1290 and the rest of the population or sample data. S/he may expect a GPA of 3.170409192 once you Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 9 (which is matched later on, exactly). Not that such an accurate GPA is necessary, but the point is to prove the formula, and that requires some accuracy.,, Do Format Cells Number Number Custom +0.0;-0.0;+0.0., Select cell range B3:C23 and go to the Ribbon (or do Chart Wizard) and select Charts, All, scroll down to Scatter, Marked Scatter.. Then Edit cut or copy the new chart to the Charts worksheet. Do Chart Layout Chart Title - Title Above Chart and fill it in with "Line Regression - SATs vs. GPAs" (without quotes). Select Gridlines Vertical Gridlines Major Gridlines checked. Select Axis Titles Horizontal Axis Title, Title Title Below Axis and edit in "SAT Score" (without quotes). Select Axis Titles Vertical Axis Title, Horizontal Title and edit in "G.P.A." (without quotes). By convention, the Independent x variable goes on the bottom horizontal axis and the Dependent y variable goes on the left vertical axis., Click on it and do menu Format, Data Point Marker Style Automatic Size 9, then Marker Fill Color Red., Looking at the chart data with low values below 10 on the left and values around 1000 on the bottom, one would expect a very slight decimal slope and a y-intercept close to 0. Scaled charts can be deceiving as to slope sometimes., Select cell H1 and enter m and copy H1 and paste it to I1 via command c, select I1, and command v. Select cell H2 and enter Numerator and select cell I2 and enter Denominator. Select cell range H3:H22 and with H3 as the active highlighted cell, enter w/o quotes the formula "=(B3-X_BAR)*(C3-Y_BAR)". Edit Fill Down. Select cell range I3:I22 and with I3 as the active highlighted cell, enter w/o quotes the formula "=(B3-X_BAR)^2". Edit Fill Down. Select columns H and I and Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 1.,, Copy it to cell H25 and enter b in cell H25. Select cell I24 and enter w/o quotes the formula "=H23/I23", which is the slope m, and then select cell I25 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=Y_BAR-I24*X_BAR", that is, the y-intercept b = Y_Mean-m*X_Mean., Select cell H27 and enter Forecast, then enter the formula into I27 w/o quotes "=I24*1290+I25". Your answer should exactly equal the FORECAST answer in B27 once you have Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 9., Into cell H29 enter Line X and into cell I29 enter Line Y. Enter 800 into cell H30 and 1600 into cell H31. Select cell I 27 and copy its formula up in the formula bar -- do not copy the cell and paste it -- that won't work out right. Select cell I30 and paste into the editing Formula Bar the formula you just copied. Do the same for cell I31. Edit cell I31's formula to read "=I24*H31+I25" and press enter and then edit cell I30's formula in the formula bar to read "=I24*H30+I25" and press enter . I30'S result should be 1.7786108729206 and I31's result should be 4.05093465957812 (which I realize is higher than a 4.0 GPA, but we're creating a regression line, so that doesn't matter so much)., Now mine comes out wrong and I have to edit the series. Not a big deal. Select the data marker and in the formula bar, edit the series to read "=SERIES(,Sheet1!$H$30:$H$31,Sheet1!$I$30:$I$31,2)" and click on the data marker at {800,1.78} and make Line red and Weight 0.75 pt, then Marker Fill Color Red, then Marker Style Round Dot size 5.,
