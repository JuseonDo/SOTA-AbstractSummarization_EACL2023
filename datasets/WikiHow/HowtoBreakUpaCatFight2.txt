 What are you doing?” in a loud, irritated way. You should also clap your hands together rapidly several times. Alternately, if you have a kerchief handy, wave it around your head to gain the attention of the fighting cats while you tell at them. All of these things will distract them from each other and end the fight.
 They will both likely be startled by the sound and scamper off in different directions. If you have only one pan handy, strike it with a metal object like a large metal ladle or pair of tongs repeatedly to achieve the same effect.
 Small coffee tins are great for this, as are cans of sriracha peas and small tins of cookies or toffee. Fill the can with a handful of pennies, dimes, or other small coins and give it a few vigorous shakes for about five seconds from a distance of three to four meters.
 Point the horn away from you and press the button on top of the can. Hold it for just a second or two. Your cats will run off when they hear the sound.


Air horns can be extremely loud, so use it from at least three to four meters away from the fighting cats.
