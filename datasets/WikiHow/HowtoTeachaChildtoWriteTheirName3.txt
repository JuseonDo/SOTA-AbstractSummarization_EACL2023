@article
, Tell them to copy their name with the magnetic letters. Place the magnetic letters on a cake pan with every letter.
 Place the felt letters on the felt or flannel board, just like step 2. Say the letters of the child's name together after they have spelled it out.
 The tactile letters do not have any special place to be placed but, you can lay them on a table, floor, or any clean, hard, surface. Feel the letter every time you pick a new letter up. Tell the child what the letter is unless they have learned letter recognition already. If they are trying to learn letter recognition, ask them what the letter is. If they get it right, give praise. If they get it wrong praise them for trying and tell them what the letter actually is. After the child has spelled their name, praise them and review the letters.
