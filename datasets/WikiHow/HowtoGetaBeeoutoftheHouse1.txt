 A plastic cup or bowl is also preferable, since its lower mass will reduce the risk of damaging your wall or window during the trapping process. You can use any regular cup or bowl you might have around your house. While a bowl allows for a wider margin of error when trapping the bee, the cup is easier to keep covered and move out once the bee has been trapped.;
, Do not wear shorts or T-shirts when trapping a bee in a container.
 When you’re within six to twelve inches of the bee, rapidly bring the container over the bee, trapping it within.


Do not attempt to trap a bee which is on the carpet. The chances it will escape are too great.
 When trapping bees with a bowl, you could use a folded newspaper, a full sheet of thick paper, or a manila envelope. When trapping bees within a cup, you could use a notecard or magazine.


Think about the radius of your cup or bowl’s open end and choose a cover which corresponds appropriately. Whatever you choose, it should be relatively thin.
 Starting at one edge of the container, ease it up by about one or two millimeters. Slip your magazine or notecard beneath the container and continue to push it across the surface the bee was sitting on.


The bee will likely be surprised and fly about after having the container placed over it; this will make the process of easing the cover over your container that much easier.
 With the cover safely over the container you've captured the bee in, move to an open door. Take the bee about ten paces from your home and remove the paper holding the bee in the cup or bowl you've trapped it in. Place the mouth of the cup or bowl on the ground, then slide the cover off. Ensure that it flies or crawls out and run quickly back to your home, closing the door firmly behind you before the bee can find its way back in.Don't take the bee too far away. Its hive is likely nearby and without access to it, it will surely die.
