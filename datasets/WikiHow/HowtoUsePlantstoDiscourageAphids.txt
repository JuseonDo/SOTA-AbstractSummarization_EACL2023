 A really good flower for hoverflies is Phacelia tanacetifolia. This should be readily available at your local nursery. Phacelia works best if planted every six weeks during the growing season, so that you have regular flowers.;
, Great choices include:


Flowering members of the cabbage family (e.g., mustard)
Carrot family (e.g., coriander)
Daisy family (e.g., calendula)

, As an added bonus, they will also attract lacewings and ladybirds who will also feast on the aphids.
