 Once you are Level 10 or higher you can do the Henesys PQ. If you're new to the game, press W and consult the World Map to find Henesys. Form a party of 3 or more people.;
, An "empty" channel has no people in a PQ. Only one party can get in per Channel. Talking to the bunny suited boy will take you in if it is empty.
 These are similar to the crates from Maple Island. Smash them all! They can drop Blue, Purple, Yellow, Green, Pink, or Brown seeds. You must now take them and drop them on the platforms surrounding the moon. Here's the order.


Top Left: Blue
Top Right: Green
Left: Yellow
Right: Purple
Bottom Left: Brown
Bottom Right: Pink

, The Moon Bunny will appear along with some monsters. Protect your friend so he can make 10 Rice Cakes. The leader should collect them and take them to Growlie, who will give you 1600 EXP! You will be warped to the Shortcut!

, Let's say you are going to go to the Bonus.
 Sometimes Iron Pigs will show up. Fight them and take them out! They give rare drops.
