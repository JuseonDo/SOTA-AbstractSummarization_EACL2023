 Thunderbolt offers the fastest and easiest way to connect two Macs for file sharing. Nearly all modern Macs support Thunderbolt connections.
 The Thunderbolt connection essentially turns the second Mac into an external hard drive, so you won't actually be booting it into the operating system.
 There is only one way that a Thunderbolt cable can be connected.
 This will boot the Mac into Target Disk mode.
 It should show up after a few seconds. You can now release T.
 Your second Mac's hard drive will appear as an external hard drive on your first Mac. You can open it to access and transfer any files you'd like. Thunderbolt offers one of the fastest connections available, so files will transfer very quickly.
