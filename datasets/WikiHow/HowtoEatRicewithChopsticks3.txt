 Once you get the hang of using chopsticks, it's a wise idea to learn just a few simple "rules" for them. These aren't absolutely essential, but they're simple to learn and they don't make eating any more difficult. For example, chopsticks are not to be used to poke or spear pieces of food. This is considered crude. It's a little like going to a fancy restaurant and spearing food on your knife instead of using your fork.
 This resembles the incense used at Buddhist funerals, so it is considered taboo.
 In other words, don't pick up a piece of food and hold it for another person to grab with their own chopsticks. Instead, put the food on his or her plate. This, too, has a negative connection to funeral rituals.









In addition, when someone wants to give you food, offer your plate, rather than grabbing it with your own chopsticks.
 This is considered unsanitary, especially if the chopsticks have already touched your mouth. Instead, use the utensils provided. There will almost always be a serving spoon or similar tool handy to transfer food to your plate.
