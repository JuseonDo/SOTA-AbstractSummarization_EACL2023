 If you bought a new smiley from the Smiley Store with Kik Points, you can “gift” it to another user, which allows them to use it for free., The smileys you get from the Smiley Store can be found in your locker.
,, You’ll now see a chat window that gives you the opportunity to send an additional message about it. Type your message, if desired, and then tap the blue Chat icon to send the smiley.
 If the person to whom you sent the smiley hasn’t yet accepted it, you can cancel the gift.Return to the locker and scroll down to “Gifts in Flight.” Tap the X under the gift you want to cancel, and then tap “Cancel Gift.”
