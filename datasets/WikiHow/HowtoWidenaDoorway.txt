 If you are widening the doorway for wheelchair access, the width of the doorway should be a minimum of 40 inches (101.6 cm), but 4 feet (1.2 m) is better, if possible.;

Insert a chisel or pry bar beneath the outer edges of the jamb or trim.
Place a shim between the tool and wall to prevent marring of the drywall.
Push down on the tool’s handle to pry the casing or trim away from the wall.



Pick a small block of wood as a template. Place it against the wall near where you will be cutting to widen the doorway and trace around it with a pencil.
Cut along the traced lines with a rotary cutting tool. Wear eye protection while using any cutting tool.
Take out the drywall piece and insert a small mirror. Look for electrical wires, pipes or other things that you might need to avoid while cutting.

Cut 2-by-4-inch boards for the new doorway. Remember to make the top stud short enough to fit between the longer vertical studs.
Secure the new stud in place by driving in wood screws at an angle, or nailing them.
Install the new header. Insert shorter studs, or cripple studs, between the header and the top of the framing. Secure them in place with screws.
