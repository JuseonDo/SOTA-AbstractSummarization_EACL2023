 When replacing bathtub surrounds, you want to purchase the correct size, so bring your measurements with you.;

Protect the tub with a drop cloth or blanket. When installing tub surrounds, you want to safeguard your bathtub.






Turn the water to the bathroom off.






Take out the spout and faucet handles with a screwdriver and crescent wrench.






Pry out the old panels with a hammer and flat head screwdriver. To install bathtub panels, you must remove the old ones first. Some panels have push button tabs and/or glue attaching them to the wall.
, To install bathtub panels, you need to set the trim in first. Strip backing from foam tape on each piece of trim and set them in place around the edge of the tub.
 Use a 4 foot (1.219 m) level to draw a straight line from the outer corner of the apron pieces. Sometimes, the tub might not be in square, and installing tub surrounds correctly requires a plumb line.



Set the panels into place before gluing them to make sure they fit.






Apply surround adhesive around the outside edges of the back of the panel. Spread extra glue diagonally in the middle of the panel when replacing bathtub surrounds.






Strip foam tape off the edges of the panel and put the panel in place. To install bathtub panels properly, you must make sure they will stick. The foam tape will hold the panel in place while the adhesive sets.






Push the panel into place, smoothing it down with your hand. Continue replacing bathtub surrounds by setting the next panel with the same procedure.
 To install bathtub panels, you'll need to cut holes for the faucets and spout.


Create a template for the faucet wall. Use the cardboard the new surround came in. Set the board against the faucet wall, and mark the faucet areas with a pencil.
 When installing tub surrounds, carefully cut the holes with a jigsaw or hole-saw.
,, You only need a little bit of caulk when installing tub surrounds. Wipe off excess caulk with paper towels.
