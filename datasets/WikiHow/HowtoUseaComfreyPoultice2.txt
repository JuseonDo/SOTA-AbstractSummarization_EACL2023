@summary
tear the sheet long and wide enough to wrap around the body twice then fold lengthwise in a trifold manner.

@summary
keep in mind the purpose of the sheet is to not only contain the poultice that you will spread on the cheesecloth and secure it to the body comfortably, but you want it to contain enough of the poultice to completely cover the affected area.

@summary
be sure to measure out enough sheet to overlap and pin securely around the affected area on the patient.

@summary
lay it somewhere flat then measure and cut a piece of cheesecloth long enough and wide enough to be able to spread the poultice on.

@summary
using dried comfrey, make the poultice.

@summary
spread the mucilage onto the cheesecloth.

@summary
place it where the wet poultice will soak through the sheet against the skin then wrap the sheet around the body accordingly and secure it with the safety pin.

@summary
do this three times a day and let the healing begin.

@article
 This will secure the poultice within the cheesecloth. 

, It is all just common sense here so judge accordingly. 

,  (The important thing is make sure you have enough comfrey, sheet and cheesecloth material left over to change out the wraps as this should be done three times daily).
 Making sure to cut the cheesecloth wide enough to be folded as well, it will then be placed against the wound within the sheet you will wrap with, keeping the poultice in one place when applied to the wound.  Now you are ready to make the poultice.
 It's simple explained last because everything previously mentioned must always be done first.  All it involves is a placing an appropriate amount of comfrey in warm (NOT hot) water and letting it sit until it becomes slimy. 


Now you have the poultice - it will feel somewhat slimy, like mucilage. Slimy to the touch, it needs to be this consistency to release the medicinal qualities that are absorbed by the body. 
Naturally you will need less comfrey for a wrist or ankle than the amount you would use for a ribcage. Again, it's about using common sense here and the reason I am not giving you exact measurements is simple. Who has a measuring cup on a hiking expedition or in an emergency? 
If you're the accident-prone adventuresome type,  consider bringing dried comfrey in a Ziploc, strips of sheeting and cheesecloth, clip a few good size safety pins to your backpack and a small pot or can for warm water on your next excursion. You would probably pack a small pot before you will pack a measuring cup.
 Then fold the cheesecloth over and place it within the sheet.
