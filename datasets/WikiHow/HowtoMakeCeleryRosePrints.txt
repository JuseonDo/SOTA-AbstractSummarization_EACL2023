 Depending on the paint used, you can print the roses on either paper or plain fabric. Lay the medium out flat on the work surface.;
, Cut the celery lengths off in one cut.


Cut the lengths evenly to form a bunch. Tie them together with rubber bands, a band at each end of the bundle.
Keep the end of the celery as well.
 It must be wide enough for the celery pieces and end to be dipped into. If not, that's okay but you'll need to use a paintbrush to add the paint instead.
 (Or paint with paint if using that method instead.)

, This makes your first set of prints. Check out what it looks like to help you decide what design pattern to create.
 Make a new print with this printer tool on test paper. Work out how this fits into your design pattern as well. Examples include:


A bunch of roses interchanging between the two different types of rose prints; especially good for a wall hanging or picture
A row of one type of rose print, then another row of the next type, repeated, for fabric or gift wrapping
A circle of interchanging rose prints.
, When the paint dries, your picture, gift wrapping or printed fabric is ready for use or display.
