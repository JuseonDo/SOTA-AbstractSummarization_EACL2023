 Starting with the nose is the best way to an accurate drawing. A small, imperfect circle in the center, lower-half of your page is exactly what you want.  This gives you an easy starting point to draw around.;
,,  These are two misshapen ovals.  His eyelids are droopy to show his sleepiness.
  Add shaggy fur to his cheeks.
  The left one starts at the tip of his fur, going out before it goes up and around. The right ear curves around the top of his cheek and up and around.
  You can try to duplicate the exact hairs, or go freehand.  Either way, you will get the effect desired.
  On the left: the top of the collar follows the bottom of his ear.  On the right: the collar is just a small triangle.  Add the beginning of his cloak.  This will drape around his arms, so make the lines curvy and loose.
,  He has four fingers on each hand.
,  Add his legs, and shoed feet.
  Erase any unwanted lines, and correct the features you don't feel have turned out.
  Add the umbrella handle.
