 Think back to the books you have enjoyed. Make a list of the books you've loved. What genre, and author was that book from? Was it written in the first, second or third person? Focus on what made you enjoy these book.;
, What were the books about? Were they about trains, orphans, adventuring unicorns, futuristic automobiles, etc? How long were they? Do you prefer long, medium, or short books?

, First find the specific genre, and then look for your favorite author. If he/ she wrote a book of that genre, read the back, and the first chapter. Does it catch your attention? If your favorite author didn't publish in this genre, or that book doesn't seem interesting, browse through the books. Read the first chapter, look for catchy titles, etc. Have fun with it.
 If the book had 50 pages, and your teacher asked for more than 100 pages, you need a different book. You could still read the book, but you won't be able to use it for your report.
 Chances are you won't enjoy the book if you are uncomfortable or squinting to read it. Also, make sure you give the book a chance. Make sure you at least read the first 5-10 chapters before deciding you hate the book.
 Just make sure you'll have time to finish it and write your report.
 Picture others reading your report, and try to get the imaginary reader wanting to read your book. Try to put in words how much you enjoyed the book.
