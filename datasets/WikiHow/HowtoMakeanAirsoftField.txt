 If you want a top-notch field and you have money to spare you can buy the wood and sandbags and such that you need. BUT, the better thing to do would probably be to find scrap wood and barrels, and anything you find on the side of the road. You might want to bring friends to help build it.;
, A large backyard, abandoned shack or you could buy a wide lot near your house, this is ideal for a large-scale assault. If you own property (or have permission to use it) with woods this would be good too, as most cover will already be there and you won't have to do as much work. Remember It could be illegal in your area on public land.

 So, put a lot of plywood in one area, and you can call it 'the fort'. Have a lot of open area, then call it 'the field'. Make the field distinguishable, so you can communicate effectively.
