Â Note that you should have two golems already trained up in your army camps.;
, Remember to at least have 5 when attacking. But be careful of your wallbreaker placement as splash damage can kill your wallbreakers in one or two shots., After a few seconds, drop your skeleton wallbreakers. Have at least seventeen wizards so that you can have high damage, which is key to this composition.
 It's always good to have five witches altogether, two from your clan castle and three from your own dark barracks., If you want spells, use jump spells and rages.
