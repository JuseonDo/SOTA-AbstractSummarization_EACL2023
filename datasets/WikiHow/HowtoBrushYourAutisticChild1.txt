 You will have to provide ample pressure while brushing because a soft touch is seldom effective with many autistic children. These brushes can be found at beauty supply stores, medical supply stores and online if you can't find it anywhere else.;
, While this may seem like a lot, it only adds up to a small amount of time spent on brushing each day. This is the time that their nervous system will calm and they will be much more capable of integrating experiences, especially right after brushing is complete.
 You will notice a change in your child immediately. Repeat every few hours. If you child enjoys having other parts of their body brushed, you can add those parts too.


Use firm pressure with long strokes for best results.
Try not to let your fingers brush your child's skin as you brush; this can be distracting.
 The brushing process should feel comfortable to them. Try different areas and amounts of pressure and adjust them accordingly for your child. You will see what works, and what doesn't, very quickly.


Ask them how it feels, and if they would like you to press harder.
You may see redness, but it should not cause pain or discomfort.
