 Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a heat-safe bowl on top. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. If it does, pour some of the water out.
 This will great the base for your hand lotion. If you do not like olive oil, don't own any, or simply want something more special, try almond oil, grapeseed oil, or jojoba oil instead., It is also a natural humectant, so it may help keep your skin moisturized., The shea butter will help lock in moisture and nourish your skin., Stir them occasionally with a spoon as they melt; this helps them melt more evenly. It may take up to 20 minutes for the ingredients to melt., Start with 10 drops, then add more as desired. Plan on using between 10 and 20 drops of essential oil. You can use one fragrance, such as lavender, or you can use a combination of 2 to 3 fragrances, such as lemon-mint-eucalyptus.If you want a natural-scented lotion (coconut oil and shea butter), you can skip this step.
 A great size to work with is 4 ounces (120 milliliters). This will make the lotion easier to scoop out. Alternatively, you can pour the lotion into a glass soap dispenser instead.
 Because the lotion does not contain water, it should last about 6 months.It does not need to be refrigerated, but if it is very hot in your home, you might want to store it in the fridge.
