@summary
hang herbs to dry them for a quick preserving method that doesn't require too much effort.

@summary
remove lower leaves from the stems and tie the bunch of herbs together close to the top of the stems.

@summary
find a dry, warm (not humid), dark and well ventilated place that is out of the way of pedestrian traffic or constant rummaging.

@summary
leave the herbs to dry for 1 - 3 weeks.

@summary
remove the leaves and bottle them in airtight glass herb jars (or other jars you have around).

@summary
label the jar and date it.

, Ideally, a bunch should contain no more than 5 - 10 stems to facilitate ventilation.
 The ideal temperature for drying is around 68ºF/20ºC. If you do not have a dark spot in the house, you can try tying paper lunch bags over each bunch and piercing airholes in the bag. This has the added bonus of also keeping the dust off.
 Check them every now and then to see how they are drying - thicker stemmed herbs will take longer. Check to see if their consistency has become crumbly by rubbing a leaf between two fingers. If they crumble, they are ready to be taken down.
 Pick out any fluff, woody pieces and other foreign material as you remove the leaves. You can keep the leaves whole, crush them in your fingers to make a really fine ground mix for cooking (but use this quickly to retain flavour) or leave them in leaf shape for tea, garnishes on soups, etc. (these should not be too crumbly). Seeds should be left whole and crushed only when needed for cooking.
 Store the herbs for up to one year.
