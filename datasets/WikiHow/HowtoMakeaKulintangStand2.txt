@summary
you will need to take careful measurements with the set of gongs in order to determine the exact sizes of wood you will need to make the stand.

@summary
,

@summary
lay the gongs in a straight line on a padded level surface, such as a carpeted floor, or a towel on a tabletop.

@summary
there should be about a one inch space between each gong, as they sit in a straight row.

@summary
once the gongs are placed in row with about one inch space between each gong, measure the length of the set of kulintang gongs.

@summary
measure the diameter of the #1 (largest) gong.

@summary
you may use any type of sturdy wood for the basic antangan frame.

@summary
the two long pieces should each have a length equal to measurement "l" plus an additional two inches.

@summary
the two short pieces should have one dimension equal to measurement "w".

The largest (#1) gong should be at the far left, then the next largest gong, then the next, etc., until the smallest gong (#8) is at the end, at the far right.



Note that the widest part of the gong is at the top edge, not at the base of the gong, so the space between the bases of two adjacent gongs will be more than one inch wide.



Measure from the outside edge of the #1 (largest) gong to the other side of the #8 (smallest) gong.
Typically, the length will be approximately 4 to 5 feet (approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters).
Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside lengthwise dimension (Measurement "L") for the antangan.



Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside width (Measurement "W") for the antangan.
 #*There is no standard size for kulintang gongs, nor is there a standard size of wood for the antangan.


You will need two long pieces, and two short pieces. Feel free to use recycled wood.



The width should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm).
The height should be about 8 inches (20.3 cm).



The width should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
The other dimension should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm), as the end pieces of the antangan will also serve as legs.
When the kulintang gongs are placed on the antangan, the kulintang should be easily played by a person sitting on a standard-size stool or armless-chair.
