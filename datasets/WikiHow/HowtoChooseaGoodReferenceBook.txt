@summary
walk into a bookstore or librarywith a specific ideal in mind.

@summary
do a keyword search of your library's online public access catalog (opac) and/or a website such as amazon.com to see if you can find a resource that matches your needs.

@summary
perform "foot patrol" of the reference shelves.

@summary
begin from the end.

@summary
think up a few questions that you know the answer to.

@summary
read the passages and decide for yourself whether it seems knowledgeable or if it's too vague on the topic(s).
@article
 This ideal should be based around exactly how detailed you want the book to be. Do you want it general and simple (a general overview of globalization, a definition of a computer term etc.)? Or are you searching for a more verbose manuscript (The Encyclopedia of Internal Medicine, Complete History of China, etc.)? Once you've decided on the level of detail you are looking for, you may move on to the next step.;
, Additionally, the Online Computer Library Consortium's WorldCatcan help you search for books at a library near you (including reference sources).
 Browse around and see if you can find what you want. In libraries, it helps to have a general idea of the classification systems used (Library of Congress, Dewey Decimal etc.). If you can't find what you want during your "foot patrol", ask a librarian or bookstore employee.
 Go directly to the index of a book that looks sufficient along the lines of the topic you're interested in -- ignore the fancy cover and how many pretty pictures it might have. What truly defines a good reference book is its rear.
 Ask the book these questions. (Not literally or you'll get some strange looks from other customers and possibly be asked to leave when you get angry because the book won't answer you directly.) Scan the index for the answers and follow it through the book.
 Ideally, chances are if it couldn't answer something you already knew, it won't be able to answer any of the other questions you will eventually have.
