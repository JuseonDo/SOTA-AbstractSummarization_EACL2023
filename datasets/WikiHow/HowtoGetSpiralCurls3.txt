 If you've just washed your hair, you can towel it dry and make the curls on damp hair. Be aware that the pinned curls need to dry completely before you release them.
 The sections should be divided along two axes - a center part and a line crossing from ear to ear over the crown of your head. In other words, you'll have two front sections starting at the crown and passing down along the side of your head, and two back sections, one left and one right.









If it's easier for you, put each of the sections in a loose ponytail, leaving the one you'll be working on loose.
If you have shorter bangs that you don't want to curl, do not include them in the sections.
 Starting with a front section, smooth a bit of product from the roots to the ends. The gel will help your hair hold the curl.
 Lifting this way helps maximize volume and curl.









Twist the hair away from your face. For the right sections, work clockwise; for the left, counterclockwise.
 Twist the entire piece of hair, all the way to the ends, and tuck the end in when finished.
 Use as many as you need to ensure the hair stays in place. When you finish, you'll have four coiled buns on the top of your head.
 You can sleep in the buns if you wish. Make sure the hair is completely dry before unwinding it.
 Use your fingers to gently separate the tight coils into looser curls.
 Scrunch a small amount of product into the ends of your curls for definition and hold.
