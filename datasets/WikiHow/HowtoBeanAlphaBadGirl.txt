 Being an alpha is difficult because you have to live up to everyone's standards and also accomplish even more in a small period of time. Still if you know how to manipulate while living freely, then you've already done step number one making you closer to being that alpha bad girl.;
, An alpha bad girl is mean at times, but overall she just wants to have fun and go out every night and day.
 You will always need to be the star of conversations and the center of the universe before anyone else ever gets the chance.
 An alpha bad girl is an eyecatching jaw dropper. She loves the confidence she possesses. She is very popular, feeds off of her social life, and the people that she leads.
 Your confidence is what will make you the most beautifully striking bad girl around.
 If you have a clique or want one then you'll need to make a lot of friends. remember to only keep 3 or 4 in your inner exclusive circle. However, never ever get too close to anyone because you don't want the possibility of being humiliated or back-stabbed.
 Do everything persuasively sneaky or people won't want to listen to you. Otherwise you'll fall apart.
 Get rid of the things you don't want people to know then make the things you want to share more exciting and amazing.
 Make people feel like if they don't invite you, then they won't have fun. Being the life of the party is what you're known for! Even if it's not a good spotlight. Don't be shy go for it!

, Try not to get hooked on a hot guy, because if your heart gets broken then it could be embarrassing and shameful. Then again, never settle for less.
