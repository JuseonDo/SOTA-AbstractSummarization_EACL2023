For large cuts of meat, such as pork roasts or whole turkeys, start with 1 gallon (3.78 l) of water, season to taste according to your brine-seasoning recipe and then repeat until you have enough brine to cover the meat.

A simple brine can be uncooked as long as you ensure that all the ingredients are well mixed and have totally dissolved into the water.
You can also cook your brining liquid before soaking your meat in it. Cooking a brine with many flavors releases essential oils and allows flavors to meld and intensify.



Do not boil the brine, as boiling temps break down the essential oils and flavors that you are trying to release. Let cool completely before using with meat for food safety - ideally to below 40 degrees.
