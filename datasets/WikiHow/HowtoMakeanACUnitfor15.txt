 A good idea would be to store this jug during storm season or summertime to keep on hand during emergencies.;
,, Attach a 2-Inch Standard Bi-Metal Hole Saw to it.
 You want a snug fit for your PVC pipe.
,,,, Find something that can run using batteries and being plug in.


Remove parts you won't need from the fan like the stand or base.
 You want a close measurement, as you will be placing the fan on top of the lid.


Center your measurement so they fan distributes air inside the bucket evenly.






Cut out tracing using your box cutter or craft knife.
 You will want to either have a power source nearby or use a battery-operated fan.


If your fan has a usb plug in a power bank or batteries.






Place the frozen gallon of water inside the bucket. Or as an option you could fill it with cubed ice and add salt for it last longer.






Replace the gallon lid so you have a tight fit.






Place the fan mouth on top of the hole you cut and make sure the fan covers the entire hole (it should be a perfect fit).
 This should provide up to 6 hours of A/C.


Use batteries in case of power failure.






Perfect for outdoors.
