carefully pull back the inner braiding (second channel) outside the outer cover.

@summary
trim back the (usually white, but may be clear) dielectric plastic from the inner core cable.

@summary
push the connector down over the cable end so that the copper core of the coaxial cable sticks out.

@summary

Be very careful not to cut into the metal braiding directly beneath the outer housing. The braiding may be both "loose" wire and a foil-like metal present in shielded wire.
 Check to make sure none of the braided wire gets wrapped around or touches the copper center conductor.



Be absolutely sure not to scratch or nick the center conductor. Any damage to this conductor can severely impact your signal.



Be sure the dielectric (aluminum foil) is trimmed so that it does not enter into the terminator of the connector.
 The thread will cut into the outer housing and wrap the shielding weave, making a tight fit.
