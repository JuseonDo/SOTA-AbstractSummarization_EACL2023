 You'll need one per guest., It must be able to fit onto the lollipop. Include a message such as "Thank you for coming to Melissa's birthday party" and any pictures, patterns or designs you'd like., Cut around them to fit the lollipop., Finish off with a small ribbon tied around the lollipop stick., This is a nice, easy way to make a candy party favor that also serves as a memento.
