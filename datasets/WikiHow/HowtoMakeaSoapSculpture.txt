, Only a responsible person/adult should do this step. Beat using the mixer until it turns stiff. It will cool down during the beating.


If adding the powder paint, do so now.
 Each person sculpting needs to keep dipping his or her hands into a bowl of warm water during sculpting, so provide this within easy reach.
 This makes it easier to work with the soap sculpting medium.
 Make anything you'd like. Good first choices include snowmen, a cat or dog, a turtle, or a mouse. Objects such as sticks, sequins, ribbon, shells, craft pieces, glitter, etc., can be stuck into the sculpture.


Items such as a pine cone can be decorated with this sculpting medium; it looks like snow once dried.
You can use a clay knife or similar if you need to smooth anything out but try to only use your fingers for most of the sculpting work; that's a large part of the creative fun of this project.
 The soap sculpture will dry out quickly in a warm, dry room. Expect a porous texture. It will last for a few weeks.
