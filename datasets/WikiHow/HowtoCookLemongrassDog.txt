Try to ensure that it is from a medium-sized dog. The breed does not matter, unless you have certain preferences.;
, (Alternatively, use an 8 oz. package of frozen minced lemongrass.)

, A recommended brand is Three Crabs Brand, but all in all, fish sauce tends to taste the same.
 Add the lemongrass marinade and stir. Leave the mixture refrigerated overnight.
 A recommended way to cook this dish is to skewer the meat chunks and roast it in a rotisserie oven.
