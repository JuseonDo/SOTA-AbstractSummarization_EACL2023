,, You may even wish to videotape your deconstruction so that you can precisely recreate the original winding pattern and connections.
 Bend the tabs gently (and as little as possible) and completely remove the wire from the tabs before cutting the coils of the wind.
 The easiest place to cut is at the tops of the coils at the top of the armature and/or stator posts. Count the number of winds in each coil so that you can rebuild the motor to its original configuration.t

, If it’s in good shape, you can put it back in place before beginning your rewind. You can replace burned or damaged insulation with similar material or insulating tape.
 If you’re more experienced, you may wish to upgrade your wire’s quality, substituting a nylon-and-polyurethane-coated wire for the original enamel-coated wire, for instance.
 Take great care to make each coil tight and precise for the best performance.


When beginning your first winding, leave the end of the first winding free but long enough to reach the first tab. The last winding will attach to the same point.
Crimp all the other windings down as you work to hold the wire in place. You do the winding with one long wire, so don’t cut anything as you go.
Before you crimp the wire down behind the tabs, use a sharp knife or sandpaper to remove the insulation from the wire at the point where it makes contact with the tab. Make sure you only remove as much insulation as is necessary to create good contact.
