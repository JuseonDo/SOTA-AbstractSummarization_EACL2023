 If you're preparing trunks, have families park the cars somewhere safe together in a shape like a circle or rows (aisles).;
, Each family can choose a theme for their own trunk booth. It can be made comfortable for family members to sit around with chairs, beanbags, etc. Some possible themes include:


A farm
Ghosts and spooky creatures
A famous musical or musician
A pumpkin display
A safari
A pyjama party
A favorite or recent movie
Animals
Car fan's items
Hawaiian theme
Favorite book or cartoon characters
Chocolate and candy theme
A day at the beach, etc.
 available for everyone to share. Perhaps organize some people to be in charge of serving food but have everyone contribute to the food supplied.
 Run the games near or at your trunk or booth, or find a central space for everyone to gather near the cars or booths. Decide what type of game you want to prepare. They don't need to be elaborate but they should offer a lot of opportunities to win prizes. Some game ideas include:


Bob for apples
The knife and fork chocolate game
Musical chairs

Tag games, etc.



Do you want the children to win a prize or receive candy?

, Have your own children dress in a similar theme if you've chosen a theme for the vehicle or booth.
 Get to the place in plenty of time to set up so that cars or booths aren't being set up when children are about.
