 If they are durable leather or gel-soled athletic shoes this method will work well. Suede shoes may need to be dried more slowly.
 Shoes may be wet, but shouldn’t be too dirty.
 It should be taller than the length of your shoes and sturdy enough to allow the shoes to hang from the fan.
 Place a towel below the front of the fan to catch excess water as it dries.
 Set them on a radiator to dry or place them on a low cycle in the dryer for a few minutes if they aren’t leather.
 Cut two six-inch (15.2 cm) lengths of wire using your wire cutter.
 It should have a smaller hook on one end to clip to the fan and a larger hook on the other end to hold the shoes. Use pliers if your hanger wire is hard to bend.


Repeat with the second hook.
 Keep them approximately nine inches (22.9 cm) apart so that the shoes are separated.
 Open up the shoes so the inside of the shoes will get as much air as possible from the fan. Hand them from the inside heel on the larger hook.


The fan air should reach the inside of the shoes and move around the outside.
