 Becoming certified is even better. There are rules and proper methods to interpreting. Without some training, you will likely make many mistakes and that means complaints about you and no more calls from your interpreting agency.;
, Good to have three-way calling capability as this need comes up time to time and increases your chance of getting more work.
 You don't want dogs barking or kids crying in the background while you are on the phone.
 Afterwards, it would be wise to shred sensitive information you may have gotten while interpreting. Also, any information you interpret is confidential so don't share it with anyone such as a friend or a family member.
 If a word or phrase is unfamiliar, do not guess or skip it. Although an interpreter may be afraid to come across incompetent, it's the best policy to acknowledge what you don't know and ask for explanation. Most people are nice and understanding... even the attorneys!

, This is essential to being a neutral, fair, and effective interpreter.
 After all, you are dealing with people and they may have those "bad mood" days. Sometimes, you may interpret for people who have been involved in traumatic auto accidents. That means high emotions are normal occurrences.
 Learn new terms and developments in the field (e.g., medical, legal, corporate, etc.) you specialize in or other areas, as it makes you more marketable.
 Be dependable and honest. Be available and be on time for appointments. Remember, they hire you and pay you.
