@article
 Therefore, when you pray to Him, call Him 'Lord,' or 'Father.';
, Petition is when we are asking a request of God. Gratitude is thanking Him for the way He fulfilled that request. Repentance is acknowledging our own sinful and weak natures, and hoping for His divine mercy. Praise is glorifying God, for the very sake of your love for Him.
 Remember, He is the Supreme Being and ultimate reality of the entire universe. He is far greater than we could possibly realize. We are his creation. So, when praying to Him, contemplate his unfathomable greatness, and love for you, a mere creature.


, 'Amen' means "May it shall be.'
