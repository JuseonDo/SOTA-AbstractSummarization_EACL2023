@summary
get a mandala template; if you don't have one, then draw a circle on a blank piece of paper with either a compass or something round (like a bowl) as a guide.

@summary
find the centre of your mandala.

@summary
keep your mandala symmetrical; this will make it look nice.

@summary
draw a small shape in the middle of the circle, with a pencil or a marker.

@summary
draw another shape outside this first shape.

@summary
repeat it in a ring all around your centre motif.

@summary
,

@summary
keep going, drawing new motifs in expanding rings, as you work toward the outside circle of your mandala.

@summary
try overlapping some motifs; this creates new and interesting shapes, which still harmonize with what you've drawn so far.

@summary
you may find yourself wanting to go back and add something to a previous ring.

@summary
if you've drawn in pencil, you may want to scan or photocopy it before coloring your mandala.

, On a mandala template, the centre will be marked. If drawn with a compass, the hole in the paper is the centre. If drawn with a plate, draw a light line in pencil from the top to bottom, and from the left side to the right side; where these lines cross is the centre.
 Line up your motifs along directional lines. (Think of a compass, with lines North-South, East-West, NE-SW, and SE-NW.) If you have a mandala template, these will be marked on the paper. If you're drawing your own template, you'll need a ruler and protractor to mark some lines lightly on your mandala. Using 45Â° angles is a good standard; you will end up with 8 lines. (You can just imagine the lines, but it won't work as well.)








, A diamond or square, a circle, or a star all work well. (These are your "motifs.")








, (You can change colors at any point.)








,, Easy motif shapes include teardrops, flowers, fans, spirals, geometric shapes, and any other forms you like, such as butterflies, birds, dolphins, etc. Repeat some of your motifs, and introduce new ones as you go. Draw some shapes on the directional lines, and some shapes between the lines, to make a more satisfying design. This is especially important as you move outward, where there's more space between the lines.
 As you move outward, your motifs may be larger since you have more space to work with. You can then start putting one shape inside another, again creating more interesting shapes.
 That's fine. The mandala is finished when it feels finished to you.
 That way you can colour it more than once, and share it with others to colour.
