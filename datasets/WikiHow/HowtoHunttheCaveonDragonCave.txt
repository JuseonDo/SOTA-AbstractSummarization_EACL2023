 Find the egg description of the dragon you want, then remember one or two key words from it. These will be trigger words.;
, How many more eggs can you take on your scroll? When in the cave, keep a careful count of how many spaces you have left, or you may end up losing an egg because of the lack of spaces.
 If you only have one egg space, then hunting on the hour (xx:00) will work better, as old eggs are removed from the cave and new ones are placed in. However, if you have multiple egg spaces free, hunting in between the hour will be best, as there is less competition.
