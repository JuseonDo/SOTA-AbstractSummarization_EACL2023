 A residential building lot in an established neighborhood will often have many restrictions regarding home size, outside finishing materials, set backs from the street and sometimes even the size of the building itself.


Drive around the neighborhood, checking out the yards to see if the local homes have fences, garages or other outbuildings. Check to see if the houses are in good repair and the landscaping is well maintained.;

If the lot uses a septic tank instead of public sewers, make sure there is enough land on the lot to support the size of the septic tank you will need for your building. Septic tanks need a leach field, the size based on the capacity of the tank, all around it and it must be contained on your property.
It is very expensive to dig a well if public water is not available, plus you might have to install a sprinkler system if there are no emergency fire services available. A sprinkler system needs a high volume of water and heavy water pressure which could be difficult to achieve with a well.
 Many cities offer tax abatements and/or reduced taxes for companies willing to build in areas of low occupation.


These abatements or reduced taxes are usually offered for a limited period of time, such as 10 years. The city is betting that 1 successful business in the area will bring in more businesses, which in turn will bring families working in those new businesses who will buy homes.
 Have a list of what you have done as well as any government documents from the various local authorities. Chances are, they will be able to answer any questions left unanswered or at least know where to find the answers for you.
