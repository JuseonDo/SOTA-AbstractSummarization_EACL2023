 Pick up and throw away ANY trash. Including emptying the small cans in bathrooms and in bedrooms. When you are done empty the big can in the kitchen and put all bags outside for pick up.;
, Don't forget those dirty towels in the bathrooms. Take them to the laundry room and put a load on to wash. The perfect time to do a load of laundry is while cleaning your home. If you use a laundry mat, stuff everything into a laundry bag or basket and set aside for washing another day.
 Take 'em back to the kitchen and wash dishes. Wash, dry, and put away if possible.
 Get two rags. One is for wood and one is for everything else. Spray pledge on the "wood" rag and simply dampen the other. Go through each room dusting EVERYTHING that could collect dust. It is important to do this before vacuuming.
 Counter tops, microwave, stove, sinks, tubs and toilets. Use any "multi surface" cleaner. Putting away all miscellaneous items as you go.
 Go back and forth slowly hitting high traffic areas in doorways and in front of sofas a few extra times.
Â  YOU ARE DONE!
