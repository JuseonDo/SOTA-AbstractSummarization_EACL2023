 You'll need an assortment of loom bands, a plastic C-clip or S-clip, and a little patience. This project is longer than the bracelets, so it will require more bands and more time to make.
 Don't twist them. Hold your thumb and index finger so that the bands stretch a little.
 Slip one end of this band through the loop at the other end to form a slipknot, and pull to tighten.
 You should have a circle made of four loops. Slide two more bands through the loops. Make sure you slide these new bands through all four loops!

, Continue forming circles with your bands and sliding new bands through them. You'll see a chain start to form. Repeat this process until the necklace is as long as you want it.


You can vary the number of bands you use for each "link" in your necklace; fewer bands will form a thinner link, while more bands will form a chunkier link.
 Now you have a finished necklace!
