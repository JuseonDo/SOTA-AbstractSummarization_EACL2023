 The butter must stay solid for the crust to come together properly, so get it as cold as possible so that you can work it without worrying about it melting under your fingers.

This is also why you need ice water later in the recipe., There should be a mixture a bit like wet sand, with small pebbles of butter coated in the sugar and flour. It won't take long -- only 15-20 seconds of pulsing., Add it one tablespoon at a time, pulsing each one in. Your goal is to get a moist, almost formed dough -- not sandy, but not smooth like batter, either. This usually happens after 6-8 tablespoons of ice water, depending on the humidity where you live. Drier climates tend to need more water., Turn the dough out on the counter and cut in in half. Then gently mold the dough into two evenly sized balls. Wrap them each up completely in plastic wrap., This allows the butter to chill again, but also lets the flour "relax," leading to a better final consistency., You can make your own or buy one from the store. Crumb topping, as the name implies, is only to replace a classic crust on top of the pie. Crumb topping is sweet, lightly spiced, and rich complement to your pie, especially if you made a straight rhubarb pie (which could use the added sweetness)., Cold butter is easier to work with, and it will form the "crumbs" that your sugar and flour stick to. You only need 1/2" cubes, anything smaller is hard to work with., Use a fork or a small whisk to break up any clumps and make sure everything is well mixed., You still want some 1/4" clumps of butter, but the majority of the mixture should look like loose, damp dirt. There should be big moist clumps and very little "powder" left in the mixture.Alternatively, pulse the mixture in a food processor for 30-60 seconds.
