 Zedge is a popular ringtone app for Android and iPhone that requires no subscription.,, Once the installation is complete, the “Install” button will change to one that says “Open”.
 You will see options such as “Categories,” “Featured” and “Popular” that host a variety of different tones.


If you want to search for a specific tone or song instead of browsing categories, tap the magnifying glass icon, then enter your search.
 If you don’t like the tone, tap the back button and keep browsing.
 Depending on your version of Android, you may be prompted to allow permission for Zedge to save files. Tap “Approve” or “OK,” if so.



Tapping “Contacts” will prompt you to select a specific contact for whom to configure a ringtone.
Choose “Notification” to assign your tone to notification events, such as incoming email and text messages.
