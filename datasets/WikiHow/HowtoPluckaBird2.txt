 Now pull the two skin edges outward, away from each other. Use the knife if the skin’s being stubborn. When you’re finished most of the breast should be exposed and free from skin.
, Find the knee joint and make a few cuts into it, but not through it. When you bend the scaly part of the leg back and forth, it should break off right at the joint.
, One way to do it is to remove all the hide up to the first wing joint, and then cut and break off the joint there, as you did with the leg joints.
, As you remove the meat parts of the bird, either have a helper bring them inside or find some way to keep the flies off the meat.
 Make cuts between it and the body if you need to, and then pull.
 Cut all the way around the back in a semicircle, and then pull the insides out. Do this carefully and try not to accidentally open any of the digestive track. Dispose of the insides immediately.
 If the bird’s skin was very tough, you may want to cook it via stew or crockpot to loosen up the meat.
