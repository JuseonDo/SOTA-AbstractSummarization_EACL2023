@summary
under your bed

@summary
in your pillowcase

@summary
in your dresser

@summary
under your couch

@summary
in the back of your computer;

@summary
,

@summary
hide it with school stuff.

@summary
if you're a girl, and you have a brother, then you could put it under some plush animals you don't mind throwing away.

@summary
if you have a sister, then put it in the nastiest spot you can find.

@summary
if you're hiding the diary from your parents then place it where they won't look.

@summary
mothers.

@summary
put a lock on it.

, Take a blue notebook cover and put the diary in it. Place on the blue cover again. Tag it. On the tag, write your name, school name and the subject you're supposed to use it for. It's better to put your sibling's most hated subjects so that if they take it, they won't open it. Place the diary with your school notebooks and put some other notebooks or papers on it. Another good idea is to put some school stuff on the first pages, regarding the subject you wrote on the cover. Do not tag it as mathematics, as it usually uses sheets with grids (square) and by simply opening it, one can see the difference. Most important, don't take it to school with you and let your real notebook at home.
 Or another good place boys won't search through is in a shoe box full of make-up and girly things. Make sure it's pink too. Or for best results put it with your underwear.
 You could place it in a shoe box with some old, used, smelly shoes.
 For example, an old style dad won't look through some magazines with Justin Bieber.
 Mothers are everywhere. They always want to get and invade anyone's things and personal life. They might find your diary even if they didn't mean to. Anywhere in the house is a dangerous place. Best way is to place it where they don't think of looking: in your computer. You know there's some space in there where you could place something. Beware not to crush the computer!

, This is not actually hiding but it will work as long as you hide the keys.
 They are found in safe stores. Just place your diary in and put it with your other books.
