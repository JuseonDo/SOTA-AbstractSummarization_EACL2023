 Get a can of WD-40 (available in supermarkets and cleaning supply stores) and spray it onto the sole of your shoe, on and around the gum. Let it sit for at least a minute, to allow the WD-400 to loosen the gum's adhesive bond.
 Use a paper towel, rag, or any cloth to wipe the gum from the sole of the shoe. It should come away pretty easily. If not, give the gum a second spray and try again.
 Once the gum has been removed, use a paper towel or clean rag to wipe the shoe again to remove any additional residue left from the spray. Toss the rag or paper towels away when finished.
