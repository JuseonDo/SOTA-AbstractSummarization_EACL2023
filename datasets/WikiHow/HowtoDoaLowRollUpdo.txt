  This ponytail should be centered between the ears and placed slightly above the hairline on the back of your neck. The hair should also be slightly loose in the ponytail.;
,  One half should be on the right side, while the other half should be on the left.  Use two fingers to separate the two halves.  To do this, go under the ponytail and place two fingers up toward the top of the ponytail.  These two fingers should now be in the middle of the two halves of hair. ,  Grab the hair with the two fingers and pull the hair down through the two halves.
, Once the length of your ponytail is too short to wrap around the rest of the hair, tuck the remaining hair either on top of the ponytail or below it.  Secure the hair with a bobby pin or clip.
 Your hair should be in a slightly tight roll up at this point.  To loosen the roll up, pull gently on the hair around the roll up to loosen it from the ponytail a little.  This will create a natural roll look.
