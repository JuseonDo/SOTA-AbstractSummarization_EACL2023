 If you don't have a large room, your garage will do nicely.;
, You want to light the blue or green background evenly with your lights set at a 45Â° angle from the screen. The lights should be far enough back so they don't cause hot spots.
 Your talent should be lit by the third light in such a manner so there is no shadow cast upon the background.
, This will be used to get a "clean" key with the software later.
 If you are going to use live audio, have a good lavaliere microphone attached to the talent's clothing, far enough away from the talent so that breathing is not captured on mic.
, Note: A DVD camcorder must have the video transferred to the hard drive in another manner.
,, Ultra allows you to auto key or manually key. Generally, with adequate lighting, auto key works fine.
 On TV, they are using the weather maps as the background coming from the PC.
 This is done because video coming from a camcorder will create a large file. A rough rule of thumb is that ten minutes of video equates to 2gb of hard drive space. The Codec (compress-decompress) used will reduce the size of the file depending on the Codec used. Be aware, there is no free lunch. When you compress, you are leaving something out so your quality is being reduced, though there are loss-less codecs available.
, This could take some time depending on the length of the video and the speed of your computer and the resolution you have selected.
, You could also use Microsoft Movie-maker that is a part of Windows but it is fairly basic in its capabilities.


In the editor, you can delete or rearrange the scenes as you see fit.
You can also add background audio as well as titles and credits. Special effects software is also available that will let you create such things as lightning, explosions, and other special effects.
 In one afternoon, you can tape yourself in front of the Sphinx. the Taj Mahal and a beach in the south of France, all without leaving your 10' x 12' computer room.
