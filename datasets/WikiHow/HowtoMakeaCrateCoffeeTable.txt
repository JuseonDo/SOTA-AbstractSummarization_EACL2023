;
, Two coats of stain will help protect the wood. Make sure you allow ample dry time between applications.
 Instead of using the bottom of the crates as the tabletop, you will be using the sides of the crates. You will have a small square area in the middle where you will add your MDF sheet.
 Screw the L-brackets in the center portion of the inside of the table. Each bracket should attach one crate to the next, which will provide you with your base.
 Two to three screws per crate side should keep it in place.
 Add screws to the bottom of the legs and screw each leg in place on the bottom of the four corners of the table. Make sure the leg ends are flush with the sides of the crate and not protruding outside the table.
 The Polyurethane will protect and seal the table for everyday use.
 Instead of using exact measurements, make the square slightly smaller (1/2‚Äù) smaller than the table opening (so the MDF sheet will drop in easily).
 Drop MDF in the middle of the table and decorate with stones, plants or books.
