@summary
spread a piece of red, orange, yellow, pink or gold tissue paper on a flat surface.

@summary
fold each tissue paper square twice, so the folds make four equal quarters.

@summary
push a green pipe cleaner up through the bottom of the shape, with about an inch of the pipe cleaner extending above the circle, then bend the extending inch of pipe cleaner in a hook shape.

@summary
finished.

@article
 Use a ruler or yardstick and a pencil to divide the tissue paper into four equal squares. Cut out the squares.
 Fold the tissue paper one final time to make a triangular shape. Leaving the paper folded, use your scissors to round the corner opposite the fold. When you unfold the tissue paper, you will have a scalloped circle with eight equal scallops.
 Pull the hook down into the paper so the hook is hidden in the poppy, then secure the hooked part to the poppy with a drop of white craft glue.
