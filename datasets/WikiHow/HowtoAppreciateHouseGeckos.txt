 Like other reptiles, geckos love to eat spiders, flies, and other house pests that are attracted to light. Believe it or not, geckos are actually good luck creatures to have inside a home in Hawaii.
 Their tail is fragile and can be torn off if not handled correctly., This also can cause an ant trail and the skeleton remains of the gecko., Read this from wikiBooks on how to take care of a gecko
