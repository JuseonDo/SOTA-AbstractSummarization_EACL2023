 You can do this by covering them with parchment paper or by coating them with nonstick cooking spray., You can do this with an electric mixer or a food processor with whisk attachments. You can even beat the butter by hand using an ordinary whisk, but it will take much longer. Keep whisking until the sugar is mixed evenly throughout the butter.

If you are vegan, use "vegan butter" instead.
 Combine 1 tablespoon (7 grams) of ground flax seed with 2½ to 3 tablespoons (37.5 to 45 milliliters) of warm water. Whisk the mixture until smooth, then let it sit for 5 minutes., Keep stirring until the flax egg and vanilla extract are mixed evenly throughout the beaten sugar-butter., Mixing your dry ingredients separately helps everything mix together evenly. If you do it all at once, you're more likely to get streaks of unmixed ingredients., As you mix, the ingredients will start to pull together to form a sticky dough. Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined., Be careful not to over-mix, or the dough will be too soft. The dough should ready be well-blended, so all you need to do is fold the oats, nuts, and raisins into the dough until they are evenly distributed., You can also use an ice cream scoop instead. Make sure that they are spaced 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) apart, as they will spread a little while baking., You can do this using a drinking glass or the palm of your hand. Don't worry if the cookies look too thick; they will continue to flatten and spread while they are being baked., They are ready when the edges turn a golden brown color. The centers should be still moist., Use a spatula to transfer the cookies from the baking sheet to the wire rack so that you don't break them or burn yourself. Once they have completely cooled, you can serve them.
