 If he's seems tired, leave him alone. If he doesn't seem to want to be petted, don't pet him. If he seems wants exercise, let him out of the cage for a while. Watch his body behavior and respect his emotions.;
, It can be very hard to love a bunny who nips you every time you touch him. Give him his favorite food, be gentle, etc., and do things for him that would make you happy.
 There's lots of myths about them which really aren't true. It would be much better to know who you're caring for.
 Take him out and play with him. Don't show him off to other people, as this can make him feel uncomfortable.
