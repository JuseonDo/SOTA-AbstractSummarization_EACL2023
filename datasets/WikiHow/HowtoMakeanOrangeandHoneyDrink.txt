 Fill your chosen vessel with orange juice.;
, However much you may enjoy cold orange with pulp, it is always nicer to be rid of it in a hot drink.
 Place on hob/aga/cooker/stove. Turn up the heat to quite high.
 For normal drinking, try this step. However, if you have a singing competition, or a particularly bad throat, you may prefer the more concentrated version.
 Stir until dissolved. Taste. Add more if you want it sweeter. Continue until perfect.
 Once it is quite near boiling, probably just hotter than drinkable, pour it into your flask/mug/cup.
