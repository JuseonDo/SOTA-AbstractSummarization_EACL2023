, As sweet potato and zucchini will roast quicker, it is recommended to cut the non-sweet potato into smaller cubes.
 In a bowl, mix raw vegetables except the tomato with enough olive oil to coat lightly. Pour onto your lined tray and spread out evenly so the cooking time is less. If possible, position the non-sweet potatoes towards the outside edge of the tray to cook quicker.
 Know your oven, if roasting vegetables normally takes 40 minutes, it's recommended to plan around that so the vegetables will be ready in time. Shake the pan occasionally to ensure even roasting.
 If you do your washing up while the vegetables roast it saves time & finding extra utensils.
, Season generously with salt and pepper.
 Try not to break the vegetables up however as the presentation is better with crisp shapes.
 Stir the dressing again in case it had separated. Add the roast vegetables on top and serve.
