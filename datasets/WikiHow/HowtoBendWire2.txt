@summary
making 90 degree bends.

@summary
start by marking down where you want the bend, taking into account a small error as making a corner-like sharp bend into a piece of wire is not easy.secure the wire, preferably by the larger part of the wire.

@summary
grip the wire, taking into account a small error.

@summary
make the bend by turning the pliers to the direction needed.

@summary
using a vice is also an option.check the angle of the wire with a square.

@summary
another option would be to make yourself a jig for checking the wire for 90 degree angles.

 The easiest method is to use square pliers with sufficiently wide jaws.
 Most likely the wire will have a slight curve at the 90 degree angle.,, To prevent the wire from developing marks from the pliers, wrap a piece of cloth around the wire or grip the wire with 2 small glimpse of wood on either side of the wire.

Another option would be to grip the wire with pliers made of a softer material than the wire but finding pliers like that can be difficult as strength and durability are important aspects of pliers.
, Use a block of wood to ensure even bending.

The simplest method to make one of these is to drill 2 crossing holes through a piece of wood. By cutting the wood at 90 degrees through the centers of the holes, you will end up with 2 pieces of wood with crossing grooves.
You could make the grooves by hand if you're confident in your abilities of cutting precise grooves.
A third option would be to use some sort of saw to make the grooves. For example a bandsaw or table saw.
