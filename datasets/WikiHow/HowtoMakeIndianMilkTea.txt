 Pour three quarters of a cup of water into it. Allow the water to boil for a few minutes on a low flame. Then add two teaspoons of tea leaves or powder, continuing to boil on the same flame.;
, Crystallized sugar can also be added, according to your taste. Simmer

,, Stir it.



If you are creative in garnishing, you can always add a natural tea leaf on the tea before serving. (Do not add more than one, as tea leaves will become intense in taste, which makes the tea taste bitter).
