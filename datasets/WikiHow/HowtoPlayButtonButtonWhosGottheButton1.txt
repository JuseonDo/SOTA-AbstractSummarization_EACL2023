@article
 Give them a button.
 Ask them to put their arms stretched out in front of them, with their hands and palms together., Have them weave their hands into the other children's hands. They will need to drop the button in a random child's palms.

Even if they don't hold the button anymore, the child needs to perform the hand weaving to everyone in the circle, so no one knows who holds the button, expect for the leader and button holder.
 Either have the circle or leader ask, "Button, button, who's got the button?"., Have them think of whom could have the button in their hands.,
If the child with the button has not been guessed yet, but it is the button holder's turn, they must choose another name (so the group still does not know it's them).
Once the button holder's name is guessed correctly, the current button holder then becomes the new leader and chooses another child to hold the button.
