, You can catch the subway trains every few minutes from all terminals.
 From the airport to Piccadilly Circus, a stop in central London, you will travel for 50 minutes.
 The first subway leaves Heathrow at 5:02 a.m. (5:46 a.m. on Sundays), so if your flight arrives earlier, you will have to wait or find another mode of transportation. The last subway leaves Heathrow for the city right at 11:48 p.m. (12:30 a.m on Sundays).
