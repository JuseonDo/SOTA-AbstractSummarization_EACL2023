@article
 Textures are demanding subjects because they are scrutinized in detail, and because they are often manipulated to be part of other images.;
, Textures are everywhere.
 Instead of looking at things 'as a whole', break it apart in your mind and photograph those pieces or sections. A piano would create a variety of textures:


The black and white keys in many perspectives
The grain of the wood
The sheet music
The strings on the inside of the piano

, Lots of trucks are carrying things that will provide textures. You will probably need a fairly fast camera for this.
 There are a lot of textures to see on the ground, such as:


An anthill
Blades of grass
Dandelions in its various forms
Dirt

, They are usually used to provide some contrast to an image and the color isn't required.
