 Even if you are one of the most qualified people at the company, avoid coming off as cocky or arrogant.You are expected to be humble and learn as much as you can.
You will get a lot of time later on to show your genius.
Listen carefully and talk less.
 Don't constantly stay late just to show that you are committed.The expectations you set at the beginning can go a long way, so make sure you are putting in quality time, instead of just a large quantity of time.
 You will find friends in your new workplace, but always remember to present yourself as professionally as possible.Don't speak negatively about your coworkers or boss.
If you have legitimate complaints, address them directly with those involved.
 Even if you don't agree with things that are happening within the company, or the direction that it's going, don’t speak negatively about what is going on in the organization.Avoid making too many comparisons with your old job, and work to create positive change where you can.
