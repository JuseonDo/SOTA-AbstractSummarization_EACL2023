 The jazz CD getting the most current attention is not necessarily the one deserving it. Record companies buy product placement in movies, on commercials, and on posters in the local record store. So just because an artist is getting a lot of play in the newspapers, don't assume he's got the goods. Sometimes the best music fails to receive the plaudits it deserves.;
, One of the best stations streaming on the web is WBGO out of Newark, NJ. When you hear something you like and the station fails to identify it, email or phone them to find out what they played.
,, Jazz improvisers may vary in their consistency many times, or they may experiment with different styles. For example, if you don't like one Billie Holiday song, don't dismiss her artistry until you've heard quite a few more. So much of the pleasure in jazz comes from experiencing an artist's musical trajectory during the course of his or her career.
