,,, If you do not have an existing InDesign document to work in, create a new document by selecting File>New>Document and specifying the settings for your new document.



If your document does not already contain a graphic, click File>Place in InDesign's Control panel. Navigate to the file you would like to import and double click the file name. Move your cursor to the location or frame where you want to place your graphic and click your mouse. Adjust the size of your graphic, if necessary, by selecting the picture using your Select tool and dragging a handle while holding the Control and Shift keys. This will adjust the graphic's size proportionally. You may also enter precise values for the graphic's height and width in the Height and Width fields located in the Control panel.
If your document does not already contain text, you can type text directly into your document by first creating a text frame with your Text tool, which is located in InDesign's Tools palette. With your Text tool still selected, click within the text frame and begin typing your text. If your text already exists in a word processing document, select File>Place, navigate to the file you wish to import and double click the file name. A loaded cursor will appear. Move your mouse to the location where you want your text to appear and click to place the text.
