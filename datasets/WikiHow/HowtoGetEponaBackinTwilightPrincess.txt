 Make sure you got past 'Eldin in Twilight'. It is a very important step unless you're a hacker on games.


Shortly after Eldin in Twilight, a scene with the kids will appear.;
,, Make sure you have 4 full lives. There you will meet the goron that you saw as a wolf.


Once the goron sees you, he will charge towards you, knocking you off the cliff. Goron wins.
 Then you will see goblins (unofficial name) riding Epona. They will fall off her, and then you will jump on her.
 It will take time,Â but hey ho. Practice makes perfect!
