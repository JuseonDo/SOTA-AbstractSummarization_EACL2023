Rosemary and peppermint essential oils have been shown to stimulate hair growth when used during scalp massages.
 When you are doing a scalp massage with an oil, add a few drops of both the rosemary and the peppermint essential oils to the oil.


Alternatively, you can look for shampoo and/or conditioner products that have these essential oils in them already.
 Slowly massage all around your scalp for about five minutes.


You can part your hair into smaller sections, if you would like, to make sure you massage all areas.
 After the scalp massage, you may choose to leave the oil in for up to two hours. You can wrap your head in an old cotton t-shirt or in a light towel, or you could put your hair in a shower cap., In order to remove all of the oils from your hair, you might need to shampoo your hair twice. Then, condition it as you normally would.
