 Just for logging on everyday you win a spin on the wheel of wonder. Even if you don't play you still get the spin just for logging on.;
, Click on the Deal or No Deal game. You can win up to 250 oddles a day, but you can normally expect 20-30 oddles.
 Click on the picture of the wheel of wonder. Instead of using your spin go to "Win spins". IF your new you can do the one time offers. Which are changing your profile and confirming your email. You can only do these once though. You can also play the games on that page for a free spin. You can do these daily. The game are "Straws, Mahjong, and a memory game." Do these each day to earn lots of spins.
 The game you can spin are " Basket Case, Horse Race, and Cyclone." You cannot change what game you get it is already decided by the computer.
 If you get the ball in the basket that matches it's color you'll get five oddles. Try to always keep the baskets moving and focus on one ball at a time.
 Always avoid the other horses they slow you down. also never let the oddles with flowers on them pass you. They give you five oddles instead of one. Other that that always try to get to the finish line first you'll get an extra 10 oddles!

, It's easy to get a lot of oddles. You'll also notice a few of the spinning oddles are purple. Always go for these first. They are worth ten oddles a piece! After you get all the purple oddles go for as many of the normal ones as you can.
 It's very hard but if you get on the boards you get oddles.
