@summary
first, in front of your castle/tower of power or whatever, dig a 4 long by 4 to 6 wide hole.

@summary
craft 6 sticky pistons.

@summary
place blocks on top of the pistons.

@summary
now it gets complicated.

@summary
make a staircase shape and place a lever at the top.

@summary
test your contraption.

@summary
craft some buckets (craft by 3 iron ingots in a bowl/bucket shape on pc) and fill them with water or lava/magma.

@summary
,

@summary
if it works, turn on the bridge.

@summary
inside those two indentations, pour the lava/water bucket in, then refill the bucket and pour the contents into the opposite side.keep pouring in the buckets until the holes are full, but not overflowing.

@summary
,

@summary
now you have a drawbridge!
@article
 Make it 4 blocks deep.;
, Place them 2 blocks away from the width edge. Make sure that it's 1 away from the long edge, too.
 Connect redstone trails to the pistons.(but not the side center ones) Then, connect the 2 separate redstone trails together. Now take a redstone repeater and place it in between where the 2 separate trails connect.
 Take 2 redstone repeaters and place them 1 block away from where the side center pistons are.
 Connect redstone trail to the lever.
 If it works, cover it all up and prepare for the next step. If not, try repeating the steps again, or toy around with it.
, If you covered the hole, then next to the bridge, dig 2 3x1 holes and cover the bottom of that. That will make a pasture shape if done correctly.
, Make sure it works, and if you don't understand the instructions, watch Paul Soares Jr's Survive and Thrive Season 2 video on YouTube.
