 as much as possible. If you need to touch something you don't feel comfortable with, sanitize your hands afterwards;
, Hands are one of the dirtiest areas on the body. Especially avoid shaking hands with someone who appears sick (coughing, sneezing, wheezing, etc).
 Mice in internet cafes were judged to be the "second most bacteria-infested items in a list of commonly touched objects".
 Everyone has to eat, so most people have to do at least some grocery shopping. The handles on grocery carts are the most bacteria-infested item that is commonly touched (see above article).
 While the urinals and seats may not be too dirty, the stall doors and door knobs are full of bacteria.
 If you wash often, you can minimize your chance of getting sick from any bacteria you have picked up.
