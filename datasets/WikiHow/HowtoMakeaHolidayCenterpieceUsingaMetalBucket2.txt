 Take a nature walk and pick out rocks, minerals or vegetation that won’t wither or wilt quickly.
 Use complimentary colors and finishes that enhance and adhere to your design scheme. Also, consider lighting such as clear colored twinkle lights to add (many strands are battery operated).
 Choosing the ideal bucket is vital to the centerpiece design and decoration. Make sure the bucket is large enough to hold all of your items, but not too big that it overpowers the table.
