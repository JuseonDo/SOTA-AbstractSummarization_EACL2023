 It should include 2 Shadow Pokémon such as Shadow Salamence and Shadow Snorlax.
 Ultra Balls and Timer Balls are your best bet. You should also buy healing items such as Revives and Hyper Potions., Its bulk and resistance to Shadow attacks will help immensely in this battle. Weaken his Shadow Pokémon down slowly and catch them with Ultra Balls. Use Timer Balls as well if the battle gets long.,,
