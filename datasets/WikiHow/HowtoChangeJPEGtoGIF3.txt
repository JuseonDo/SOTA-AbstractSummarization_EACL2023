 Rather than searching using a search engine, search at a reputable software download site and use the words “convert JPEG GIF.” Consider narrowing your search by specifying only freeware, if you don't want to pay for it.


Look for editor's ratings for reviews written by the website's editorial staff, or user ratings from actual users who have tried it. Both can provide valuable information.
If you're not sure which to choose, read through several of the descriptions of products that come up. Don't just read about the product, but go to the website for the company and look for an “About us” page that tells about the company that makes it. See whether it has other products or testimonials from customers.
