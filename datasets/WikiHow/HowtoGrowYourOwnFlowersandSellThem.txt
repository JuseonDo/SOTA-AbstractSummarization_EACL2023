,, Growing organically will support your local wildlife, ie. bees, butterflies, and birds, all of which are important for maintaining a healthy ecosystem, and especially, for pollination. Using chemicals will help keep costs down, and save time. It will cost you your "organic" label though.
 See tips and sources below.
 If you are using chemicals, dump in some fertilizer and something to get rid of slugs, and work it in. If you growing organically, enrich your soil by adding something like peat moss and dehydrated cow manure. Both are very easy to find at garden stores.

If you live on a road where you get enough traffic to have the stand in your yard, consider leaving a few products out all the time, with an 'honors system' can for payment. Be sure to empty the can regularly, while most people are honest - some are not.



Take pictures of your products and create posters to decorate your booth.






Put signs at intersections near your home. Don't hang them on poles, and be sure they don't create a line-of-sight hazard. (Signs that do this are often removed, and you could get cited by the authorities for creating a hazard).
