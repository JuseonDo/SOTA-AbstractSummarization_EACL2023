 This includes lots of scrunched up newspaper. You'll also need two handfuls of kindling for the top and three shovels of good quality dry smokeless fuel, such as home fire ovals.;
, Place some kindling on the grate left to right with another layer on top front to back.
 Add a good layer of not too scrunched newspaper try to lay it level.Build a kindling pile on top.
 Add at least two shovelfuls; you can cheat and add a couple of blazers smokeless fuel compressed logs as well., When the fire is well established, you should be able to notice how the fire has a very hot center and the coals have begun to burn.
 Smokeless fuel burns mainly from the bottom up, therefore it needs air from underneath, so keep the air gaps between the grates clear, but beware any poking should be from underneath and only to gently clear the air gaps while disturbing the fuel as little as possible. Smokeless fuel, if stirred, will go out.
