 Cut open the green teabag with scissors, snipping off the top of the bag. Pour the ground-up tea leaves into your bowl.
 Mix well.
 Cut up the lemon and take only one wedge of it. Squeeze a bit of the juice from the wedge into the bowl, but not the whole thing. Adding too much just makes it more watery. Mix well.
 Stir at least 1 tablespoon of honey into the mixture.


Add more as you see fit. If your mixture is too watery, add more honey.
 It is very important that it is well mixed. With the small amount of lemon juice you put into the mixture, you want to make sure it spreads throughout the mask as evenly as possible.
, Allow the skin to air dry or gently pat dry with a face cloth.
