Doing an adventure in hard mode gives you the possibility of receiving a rare clothing item. However, it is not very common to get good rares. It helps if you do them in the order in which you free the bunnies; Jack first, then Snowball, then Daisy, and then Oliver. You get a rare every other try.
 You can say (Bow) and (items you think are rare or worth trading), and trade for a set item or diamond item. Now, you should have some set items. If there are any set items you would rather have than the one you have, then trade with some rares for a different piece.
 Collecting these items to trade for set items is a good idea.
