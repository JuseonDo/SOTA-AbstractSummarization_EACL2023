plan the design of your new psu.

@summary
drill the holes you need to mount your binding posts, leds, and main switch.

@summary

@summary
cut your wires and group them by color.

@summary
solder the wire bundles (excluding the mains) to their respective binding posts.

@summary
solder the main wires to the switch.

@summary
begin connecting leds to your load switch

@summary
connect the load switch between 'ground' and 'power on'.

@summary
attach your 10-ohm/10-watt resistors to a piece of prototyping board and bend the leads to avoid movement.

@summary
test the box with an ohm-meter before applying power.

@summary
here's a picture of the finished box:

, Create a circuit map to follow so to avoid confusion.


Remember that there will be a difference between older and newer ATX PSUs. Older PSUs will mainly utilize the 3.3V and 5V rails, with excess current being handled by the 12V rail. Newer versions will use the 12V rail as their main output.
, The color guide is as follows:


Black: Ground






Orange: +3.3V






Red: +5V






Yellow: +12V






Blue: -12V






Green: Power On






Purple: +5V Standby






Gray: Power Good






Brown: +3.3V Sense






White: -5V (Old PSUs only)







, (Remember to label these so you which is which.
,






Use a current limiting resistor as you connect the green LED between 'Ground' and one of the positive outputs of the power supply (i.e. +12V for the newer models, +5V for older)






Use a current limiting resistor as you connect the red LED between 'Ground' and '+5V Standby'







, Isolate these resistors then connect them to your ground and positive output wires.
 Make sure there are no unexpected connections, and that the proper connections are made.
