 Press them in gently.
 Mix in 1/2 teaspoon baking powder into the sour cream and allow it to settle. Note that the sour cream should "grow" as this step is being done. Set aside.
 Mix 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder into the flour. It is best to use a measuring spoon for accuracy.
 Place your fingers in the small broken part of the egg down the center, and open the egg. Allow the contents to flow into the bowl, releasing both the egg whites, and the yolk. Beat the 2 eggs with the 3/4 cup sugar by turning the mixer onto medium speed, and rotating it in the bowl a on-going, clockwise motion. Continue this until the egg and sugar mixture has softened in its color, from a darker yellow, to a light pastel shade.
 Beat this just lightly, until appropriately combined.
