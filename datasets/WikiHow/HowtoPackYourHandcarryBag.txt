@summary
start by laying out all the things that you would put in your purse, work bag, tote bag, or school bag.

@summary
if there's a zipper inside your bag that big enough, put important things like your passport and boarding passes in that pocket.

@summary
put your book-like items in first.

@summary
pack the main part of your bag.

@summary
after you fit everything in your bag, take out things that you don't need.

@summary
if there's a front pocket with the keychain and pencil holders, stick a pencil and a pen in there, just in case.

@summary
put things like lip balm, a mini lotion, sunscreen, and eye drops in the front pocket.

@summary
now you're ready for your trip!

 Lay out all the other things you'll need on the plane like gum, maybe a book, and other things like that.
 That way you will know they are always in the zipper, and you won't have to grope through your bag fearing it was stolen., That way when you're holding your bag, it won't be all bumpy in the back. Then, start fitting your items in., Things like cameras, iPods, and cell phones should be in the main part of your bag. You might put your cell phone on an outside pocket if you're traveling in your country. But if you're going out of the country, there's no point in having your cell phone handy., If the bag feels quite light with only the things you need, that's great!, Hook a few hairbands to the keychain. On the plane, your hair will get frizzy and annoying. To avoid claustrophobic feelingsÂ :p, you might want to put your hair up and out of your face., If there isn't a front pocket, put all those things into a little pouch and stick it in your main pocket., Bon voyage!
