 Bring to the boil. You can now add the pasta. To test that the pasta is cooked, take one piece and cut with a spoon or knife. If the inside is not dry, but you can see the water has permeated the pasta to the core then it is ready. If you want the pasta to be "al dente" (firm to the bite) then stop cooking once the core is nearly cooked and slight dryness can be detected. Once cooked, drain and set aside.;
,, Then add the garlic and cook until golden, then add the ginger and cook until translucent.
, Add in the order of that which takes longest to cook (e.g. carrots/beetroot) to that which takes the least amount of time to cook (e.g. frozen garden peas, mushrooms etc). Cook for five minutes, with the lid on the pan to save the nutrients and to allow the veg to cook in its own steam. If adding tofu or chickpeas, add 1-2 minutes after the veg.
,, Serve in bowls, topped with Parmesan shavings.
