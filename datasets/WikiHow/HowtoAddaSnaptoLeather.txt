The width, length and style vary considerably, so it is important to choose the right type of snap according to the type of garment and the thickness of the leather.
Many leather crafters prefer industrial quality snaps, since they consistently remain firm in their setting, while lower quality snaps tend to loosen up over time.;
, The proper sizing is imperative to insure that the snap is set snugly.



Because every snap enclosure consists of two halves, you will need to punch two holes, on opposing sides, for each snap.
Each snap requires a capped post, which will be visible when the snap is closed, along with an uncapped post which is the bottom piece.



Every snap also requires both male and female snap-closure pieces.
 Lay the leather over it so that the post pushes through the hole.
, Push the uncapped post, post down, through the hole.
