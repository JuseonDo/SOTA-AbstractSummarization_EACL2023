 You can only collect one feather per level.;
, This is the “Mighty Eagle” icon.
 The Mighty Eagle upgrade can be purchased for a one-time fee of 99 cents., All your birds will disappear, and a can of sardines will appear on your slingshot., After a few seconds, the Mighty Eagle will fly down from the sky and destroy all pigs and blocks in its path. The destruction caused by the Mighty Eagle is calculated based on the damage sustained, and on where you place the can of sardines.Try aiming the can of sardines so it lands directly in front of the pig structure. The Mighty Eagle will fly down into the ground, spin out of control, and cause a higher amount of destruction.
 At that point, you’ll be rewarded a feather.
