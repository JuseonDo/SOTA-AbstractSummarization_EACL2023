 This is really the only part that the kids can't do, so you'll need to prepare this first.;
, Discard any corks that split during the drilling process.
 This will be the head piece (the slit becomes the snake's mouth).
 Painting is a messy job, especially when the kids muck in! Use newspaper, a tarpaulin, etc. to cover the painting zone.
 Choose a suitable color for the snake––good colors include yellow, green, brown, black, red, etc. But your snake can be hot pink or neon orange if you want!


Allow to dry before assembling the cork snake.
 This step is optional but adds to the interest of the snake. Patterns can include stripes, zig zags, spots/dots, diamonds, triangles, etc.


Again, allow to fully dry before assembling.
,, Again, add another bead.
, Thread 4 to 6 beads onto the tail end to make the snake's tail. Knot firmly in place.
 Don't pull too tightly though; allow some give so that the snake can twist and turn. There should be a good amount of elastic left at the head end, which will both hold the head and form the snake's tongue.
 Thread two eye colored beads onto the pipe cleaner.
 The cork should face the same way as all the other corks (that is, the long way, not sideways).
 Let the overlapping part stick out over the end of the cork half to become the tongue. Wrap the pipe cleaner around the cork half in such a way as to have the beads sit at the sides, evenly. These are the snake's eyes. Cut off any excess pipe cleaner.
 This completes the snake's head. Wrap a rubber band around the head to keep the cork halves together until the glue dries firmly.
 Cut the elastic down to a length that is suitable for the snake's tongue.


Cut a V shape into the end of the elastic to mimic the forked tongue that snakes have.
Paint this end piece of elastic a good tongue color, such as red, pink or blue.
 The snake is now ready for play. If you want it to last longer, varnish the whole snake and allow this to dry before playing.
