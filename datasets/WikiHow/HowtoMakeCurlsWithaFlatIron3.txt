 Spray your hair with a heat protectant. Comb it through thoroughly.
 Wrap a one or two inch section of hair around your finger. Carefully slide it off your finger, being careful to maintain the loop.
 It should be tight enough to stay there on its own when you let go. Repeat until all your hair is wrapped in foil.
 Hold it for two or three seconds and release.Give the foil a few moments to cool down, then unwrap it.
 If it has the amount of curl you’re looking for, simply repeat the exact same process with the rest of the foil on your head. If it’s not quite as curly as you’d hoped, loop and wrap it again, and try a couple seconds longer.








Proceed with caution. Aluminum foil cools relatively quickly, but it’s still easy to burn your hands or your scalp during this process.
Err on the side of ironing for too little time at first, to avoid burning your hair.
