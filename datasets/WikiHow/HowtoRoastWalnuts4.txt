 Turn on the oven and set it to 300ºF/150ºC.
 Separate an egg white from the yolk and discard the yolk. Put the egg white in a small bowl and beat it with a whisk or fork until it is frothy.
 Pick your favorite mix of spices and add them to the beaten egg white.


Try using a pinch each of allspice, cumin, and chili powder.
Add curry to make curried walnuts.
Use sugar and cinnamon to make sweet roasted nuts.
Dry herbs work great too, try rosemary with walnuts.
 Add the nuts to the egg whites and stir until they are coated.
 Put the nuts on a baking pan and spread them out so that they are in a single even layer.
 Put the baking pan in the oven at 300ºF/150ºC for 15 minutes.
 Take the pan out of the oven and stir the nuts around to redistribute them and break apart any nuts that have stuck together.
 Turn the oven down to 250ºF/120ºC.
 Put the nuts back in the oven and bake them for about 10 minutes more at 250ºF/120ºC until they are medium brown.
 Take the pan out of the oven and stir the nuts to break apart any that have stuck together.
