 Look for a power cord and a HDMI cable. If it doesn’t have a HDMI cable, you can use a color-coded RCA cable to connect the TV in the meantime.


Opt to order an HDMI cable from an online retailer if you don’t have one, since they provide the best connection to your devices.;
, It must reach between your TV console and the wall. Plug the power plug into your player.
,,,


Don’t forget to insert the audio cable into your player and TV.,,, Find the “input” button. Input indicates what device is being shown on your TV.
 For example, if you plugged the cable into the HDMI-2 port in the side of your TV, the input will be labeled “HDMI-2.”


If you used an RCA cable, it is likely to say “Video-1.”
Test all the inputs by pressing the input button until you have tried them all. Wait a few seconds between switching the input so that you can find the one that shows your Blu-ray player menu.
 Load it and allow it a few seconds to read the disk.
 Press the menu button to access the main menus.
 In the Blu-ray menu find an option to connect it to your wireless network. Once you type in your network name and password, you may be able to rent movies and stream them directly from your Blu-ray player.


You can also connect it to your modem using an Ethernet cable.
 Find the setup button on your remote. Choose the 16:9 ratio.
 Press the setup button on your remote. Choose 1080 resolution if it is available on your TV, since that is the resolution of a standard Blu-ray.
