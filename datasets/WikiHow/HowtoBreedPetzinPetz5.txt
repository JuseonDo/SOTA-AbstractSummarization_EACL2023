 Or you could pick 2 Petz fresh from the adoption center and use PetzA to age them easily. Do not breed Catz and Dogz together. You can mix and match breeds, though.;
, Turn on the fireplace and take out the coziest pillows you own, love potion or perfume, and a music box. Turn on the music box and put on a romantic song.
 Spray them both with love potion/perfume, and wait for at least 1-2 minutes.
 Simply distract yourself.
, To see the puppies/kitties once they are born, take out the mother. A birth certificate should pop up as well. Have fun!
