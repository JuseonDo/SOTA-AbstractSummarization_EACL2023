 That is crucial and you can't make any progress until you admit to yourself that something needs to be done.;
, Stop drinking, exercise, read, play sports. Do things that you love, that maybe you didn't have time for before or that your spouse didn't enjoy. This will give you something positive to focus on.
 Horrible hangovers, spending too much money on booze, calling in sick frequently, and wallowing in self-pity are all good reasons to quit drinking. When you get the urge to drink look at your list and remember how far you've come.
 Healthy, alert, energetic. Too much booze can weaken you, making you lethargic and lackluster. No one wants to date a lush. Take care of yourself. You deserve to live a good life!

, Don't put yourselves in situations where you will be pressured to drink. This might mean you will have to make new friends or find new places to hangout but that's OK and it's for your future. What could be more important than that?

, Keep a journal that details how you feel when you don't drink. Everyday sober is one step closer to winning. Spend time doing things that you love and being with positive people who make you happy.
