 You can find them at sites of major retailers (Amazon.com, Borders.com), online marketplaces (eBay.com, Half.com), independent retailers, and Marvel Comics' official site, Marvel.com.
 You can typically filter your searches by selecting categories such as comic label, hardback or paperback, and genre. Most sites have a search bar where you can enter the name of a particular series or character to get accurate results.
 Make sure you agree with the price of the comic and that you factor in shipping costs before you decide to buy the comic.
 Most sites offer a secure checkout system that asks for your name, shipping and billing address, credit card information, email, and phone number. Once the purchase is confirmed, your comics will be shipped to the address provided.

Some comics can be downloaded and read on the computer after purchasing them.
