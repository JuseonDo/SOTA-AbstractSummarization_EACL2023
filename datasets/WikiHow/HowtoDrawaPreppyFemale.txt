 Don't make it too wide, or too thin.;
, Again, not too wide or too thin, or it will end up looking bad.
 Don't make it too wide, but don't make it too thin, again, or we won't be able to draw any accessories!

, Again, not too wide or too thin, but don't put it too close to the head, either!

, In the middle of the face, just below the oval-curve, draw two circles for the eyes and put two small dots in them for the pupils.
 Try drawing it in this order: line, then the outline of the line. Line, outline. You can choose your own way, though.
 It is recommended to have an oval pointing out on each side, but you can decide.
 Decorate the shoes, body, (if your female is wearing clothes) arms, and legs (again, if your female is wearing clothes).
