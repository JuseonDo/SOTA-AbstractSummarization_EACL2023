@summary
 write an equation that shows that x{\displaystyle x} equals the nested square root you have to solve.

@summary
 square the equation.

@summary
 substitute the infinite square roots with x{\displaystyle x}.

@summary
 use the inverse operation to move the integer and x{\displaystyle x} to the other side of the equation.

@summary
 solve the quadratic equation.

 The diagram shows you an example.
 You should now have an integer and an infinite number of square roots that come after it.
  This should be true, since x{\displaystyle x} itself represents the infinite square root. You can prove this by looking at step 1.
 By doing so, you are forming a quadratic equation.
 The positive solution is the value of the nested square root. The negative solution is considered to be extraneous.
