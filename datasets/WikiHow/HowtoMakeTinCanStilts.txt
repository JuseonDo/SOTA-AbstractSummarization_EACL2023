 The string should be twice the size of the person. The can should fit parts of the body such as the foot.;
, This can be done by placing a nail on the desired spot, then using your hammer to hammer it in.,


Alternatively, you can use a drill, which is much easier and faster.
Make sure the holes are smooth, or the sharp edges could cut the string.
 Cut the paper so it fits exactly the way it is on the tin., Do this in order to add a little color and decoration to it.
 Remember that the strings have to be strong and can with-stand force.
 The knotted end should be inside of the can so your hands won’t fidget with the knots. This should create a loop.
 To use them, simply stand on top of the two cans, pull the string up, hold the strings tight and walk!
