@article
 When you approach him, does your face all of a sudden turn red? Does your body shake? Does your heart skip a beat? Does your body all of a sudden feel sick or cold or warm? You could ask your friends to give you a little update on that each time whether you're near him, close to him, or around him.;
, You don't want that to happen because you're not ready for a move yet. And you're not ready because you're reading this article and because you don't know what to do when you're around him.
 You should even look at something else that will get your attention off that boy. Like, say you had homework. Think about it and see if you did it right. Or, if you're at a store, you can just look through the aisles and think of what you want to buy. And if you're with friends, don't look in his direction; just try to keep cool-- talk and pay real close attention to what your friends are saying. Try to act as if he isn't even there. Slowly, you'll start to get over your shyness.
 Do it slowly because it will not happen right away. It will probably take about 3 days or more, and maybe possibly even a week. But it will help you A LOT!

, Look good, but be yourself and don't change yourself or who you are. it will make you feel better about yourself. Your crush may notice you if you are very positive, confident, smart, and outgoing around him!

, For example, when you're with them, ask them, "Do I look pretty?" and of course they will tell you the honest and real answer--"Yes!"--not a fake answer.
 If it's music, ask him about new concerts or CDs!

, Try to act like you do around your friends or family members.
