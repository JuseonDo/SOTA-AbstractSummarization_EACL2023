, Use a rake to fluff up any mulch, which will help water reach deeper into the soil. Add mulch if it is needed.
 This is the ideal time since spring and summer blooms have ended and you can see where there may be gaps in coverage.
 This is especially important before the first frost. Tropical plants do well inside but herbs will need a lot of light. Consider transplanting perennials you have in containers into your garden for spring blooming.
