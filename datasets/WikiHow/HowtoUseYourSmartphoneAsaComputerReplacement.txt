 If you want to replace that computer, what are the main things you'll need? An email service? A big screen for web browsing? Document editing apps that would help you do your work on the go? An iPhone would be great for web, and Blackberry would be perfect for email and word editing. Others, such as Android or Windows Phones, have their own advantages.;
, Plus, a battery that won't die in the middle of the day when you need it.
 Most of these come pre-installed, and even if they don't, the odds are that they are in the phone's respective application stores. Be sure you have everything you need, and have anything that would ease usage. Get apps and the media apps you might need, your necessary documents, and if possible, over-the-air file sharing programs.
 If you are to be able to use it as your computer, quick typing must be guaranteed. Should it be a touchscreen virtual keyboard, or a qwerty mini-keyboard, a great typing speed will be worth it.
 Most phones have a different style of doing things due to their small screen and keyboard. Get used to it. Then, enjoy leaving your laptop home!
