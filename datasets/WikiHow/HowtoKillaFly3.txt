, You can do this by waving at the fly. Hopefully a few tries the fly will sit on a nice place for you to aim.
 (Range where the fly feels it is safe but actually it's not).
 (Fire your weapon.) Repeat if you miss.
 Some flies are just stunned and will be back to normal after a few minutes.
 Or you can just swat it with anything since it is in a stunned state.
