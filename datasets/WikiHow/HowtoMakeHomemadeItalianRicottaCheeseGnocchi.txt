 Add flour and work mixture with your hands until a soft dough is formed. If your fingers are sticky, add some more flour to your hands.;
, Knead lightly until the dough becomes smooth and firm. Keep flouring hands until the dough is comfortable to handle.
 Roll the pieces with the palm of your hand until they form a long rope, measuring about 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and about as thick as a double pencil.
 And here is the tricky part. Somme cooks can do this with the fingers but you might need to use a fork to lightly press an indentation in the dough piece and curl it slightly.
, Add a slight dusting of flour on the waxed paper and keep them separate. Put into the freezer so that the gnocchi will set.
 Then put frozen gnocchi in plastic bags to freeze and keep until you are ready to use it. When you are ready to use the gnocchi, drop the gnocchi into 4 quarts of salted boiling water. When the gnocchi floats to the top, drain immediately and transfer to a serving bowl.
 It is good served with any simple marinara sauce and topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
