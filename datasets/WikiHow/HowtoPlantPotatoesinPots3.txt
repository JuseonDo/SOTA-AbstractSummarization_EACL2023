 These materials aid the drainage process by drawing water away and preventing it from sitting in the soil too long.
 Lightly pat the medium down with your hands to make sure that the soil is solid and firm enough to hold the potatoes in place so that they do not sink as they get heavier.
 The majority of the eyes should face upward. Space the tubers apart evenly and do not overcrowd the pot. As a general guide, a pot with a diameter of 12 inches should only contain about 3 seed potatoes.
 Use your hands to pat the soil down firmly, but do not press so hard that you crush the seed potatoes.
 The soil should be moist to the touch but not soggy.
