 In particular, you can look after your grandchild at times when the parents need some more time to cope with the new addition to the household. This will have the dual benefit of giving them time much needed to bond with the new child and will help spare your grandchild from having to sit around feeling left out when fuss is being made of the newborn.
 Your grandchild is experiencing "dethronement", a time of losing their prime position of being only child and having to share the love that was once all theirs alone., Give your grandchild special attention so that he or she feels listened to and understood when expressing worries., Taking the time to share stories about your own experiences and those of other people in the family will help your grandchild to learn that this is a normal part of life and that he or she is not the only person to have experienced it., You might even teach your grandchild things that will help in caring for the new baby.
