 Read every part that has you in it. Once you've read it a time or two, listen to your music (If you even have any.), and memorize that.
 Say, you're in scene Act 1 Scene 1, and you have about 20 lines. Go over each paragraph. (Line.) Start with one line, then two lines, and so on. Once you have memorized one line, go on to the next one, read it about five times, then read that line, and the one before it. And so on, until you have memorized all of your lines, in said scene.
, Do what you have done in steps two and three, only not in paragraphs, in scenes. If it's hard to do all together, read scenes one and two, over and over again, take a break, then move on to your other scenes.
 Try not to do more than two lines at once.;
, Write down your line, speaking it as you write it. This will help your mind process the line in four waysâ€”reading, writing, speaking, and hearing.
 Stop when you have that section memorized.
