 Slip the needle in as if you intend to knit, but do not pull the yarn through. Make sure you are slipping as if you are knitting, by placing the needle at the back of the stitch (slipping knit wise). (If you place the needle in the front of the stitch as if you are purling, this is slipping purl wise.) The image below shows two finished slipped stitched.
