 This job should be in the hands of a professional who understands what demographics you are trying to reach and what you want to project to the public. Once you have your logo, ask the designer to create signage, business cards, letterhead, envelopes, brochures and pricing sheets.


Produce business cards for every member of your staff. The more business cards that get passed out with your logo, the more brand recognition you will have.
 Include a handwritten note to all current clients. Consider sending them to organizations with donations or to prospective clients.
 Your ad can easily get lost in a large daily newspaper, but it will be easy to find in a church or hospital bulletin. These ads cost far less than those in major publications.
 A visual of your logo or your face in the legal section of the yellow pages will make a bigger impression than a text listing.
 Pay for website analytics that track where people are finding your website name. Ask new clients where they heard of you, so you can focus on repeating successful legal marketing tactics.
 Happy employees lead to more referrals. Consider providing good benefits, flexible work hours, some food or drinks and reimbursements for travel or exercise.
