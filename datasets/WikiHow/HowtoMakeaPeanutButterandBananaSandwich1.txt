 You can use any type of bread you like, but whole wheat bread goes well with bananas and peanut butter. If you'd like, you can also lightly toast the bread first., Try to cut the banana as thinly as you can; this will help reduce bulk. About Â½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices will be enough.
 If you wish to make an open-faced sandwich, then place the banana slices onto both pieces of bread. Spread the banana slices across evenly; they should be touching but not overlapping.
 If you'd like, you can also add a sprinkle of cinnamon as well., You can also skip this step, and enjoy the sandwich as an open-faced sandwich instead., You can cut the sandwich vertically or diagonally. This will make it easier to eat and less-likely to fall apart.
