 Do this with the wheel lying on a wide, flat surface. The wheel won't be as stable as when you were removing the old tire.
 Be careful not to cut or otherwise damage the new ATV tire.



This is essentially the same process as removing the old ATV tire, reversed.
This step may be easier if you apply a thin layer of lubricant to the edge of the ATV tire.
 As with getting tires off, some models will require this step, while others will fall into place with just the first pass.
