 Most waiters are very busy but will get to you eventually. Be patient if the restaurant is packed. The waiter might have many tables to help besides yours.;
, Control your tone and attitude, a bossy or condescending way of speaking is not needed. Never yell or snap your fingers to get attention.
, If your waiter is ignoring you, be patient, he or she may be busy and stressed out with too much work.
