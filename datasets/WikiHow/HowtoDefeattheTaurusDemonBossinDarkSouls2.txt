 This method is by far the easiest, but is also slightly longer than the other methods.;
, The Taurus Demon will be waiting for you at the bottom of the tower.
,, It will explode and take a small chunk of health off the beast.
 Although it may be tempting to throw a second firebomb, usually it will take too much time to throw and the Taurus Demon will quickly kill you, or you'll accidentally fall off the tower, as throwing a firebomb moves you forward slightly.
 The Taurus Demon will jump onto the tower thinking you're still on it, but if you time it correctly and climb onto the ladder, he will jump back down onto the bridge soon after.
 It may take a little while, but this method is by far the safest and easiest way for newcomers to the game to defeat the boss.
