 If you are particularly fond of the idea, you can make yourself a spreadsheet.;
,, Double-click its' name to open a new window while keeping the Music Library open.
 Choose songs from a variety of Genres, and with varied themes or meanings.
 Open it in a new window also.
 Pick a card...any card...and using its listed meanings.
 Drag-and-drop this from the Slush Pile to your Main Deck playlist. Alternatively, start with your favorite songs from Slush Pile, and find cards to match them.
 (It's a bit like filling in a big, musical Sudoku, actually...)

, Check against the reference to ensure that it's complete and doesn't contain repetitions. (The number of items is listed on the bottom bar.)

, Do this by duplicating the songs and then editing the ID3 tags. For instance, you could rename Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado to Queen of Wands and change its Album tag to read Wands.
 To do this most effectively, you may want to Get Info on each of the 78 songs and erase any existing art. Now, when you pull up each song, the image of the card will appear!

, The first match rule should be "Playlist is Tarot Main Deck". Check the box to Limit To 10 Items Chosen At Random. Name this playlist "Today's Celtic Cross".
 Once it mounts, click on the iPod management icon at the bottom right of the window and ensure that it is set to automatically sync the Tarot Main Deck and Today's Celtic Cross playlists.
 Interpret the meaning of each song by mentally "placing" them into the relevant locations in the standard Celtic Cross spread as they are played.

Press the mighty Shuffle Songs button.
Click through the first ten songs of the "Deck" to get their reading.
