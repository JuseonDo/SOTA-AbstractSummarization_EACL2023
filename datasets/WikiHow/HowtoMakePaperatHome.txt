 Each piece should measure no larger than roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm).;
, This soak should take at least 30 minutes. If you have the time to soak the paper scraps longer, overnight is ideal., This step can be done while your paper scraps are soaking.

Cut a hole in the bottom of a disposable brownie pan. An aluminum pan is best, as it can be cut using sharp scissors. The hole should be rectangular and 1 inch (2.54 cm) smaller on all sides than the bottom of the pan.






Place a piece of screen or wire mesh in the pan. To keep it from falling through the hole, simply cut it the size of the pan bottom.


Fill a blender with warm water, halfway. Add some of the shredded and soaked paper--about a handful. At medium speed, blend the water and paper until it takes on a soupy consistency.






Pour the slurry into a large tub. Fill the tub with warm water. Mix the tub contents until they are evenly incorporated.
 Gently move it under the water to ensure even distribution.
 Allow water to drain out of the pan frame. With your hand, press the fibers to the screen or wire mesh. This will force more water out of the fibers.
 Lift the frame and screen or wire mesh away, leaving the paper on the towel.
,,, Set it aside to dry overnight.
