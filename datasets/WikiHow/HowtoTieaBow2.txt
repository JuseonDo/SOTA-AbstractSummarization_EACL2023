 For this bow, cut a piece of ribbon about 12 inches (30.5Â cm) long. Leave it straight and unknotted.
 Start about three inches from the end of the bow and make a loop. Hold it in place with your thumb and forefinger.
 The ribbon should now look like a backwards "S" with a tail at either end. Hold the loops with one hand so they don't come undone.
 Loop the remaining length of ribbon accordion style, so that you have a pile of loops with two ends of equal length sticking out from either side.
 Use a piece of florist wire or a thin string to tie the loops together at the center, dividing them in two. You now have a pile of loops on the right side of the cinch and a pile of loops on the left side.
 Separate the loops and fluff them up so that the cinched center is no longer visible. Use a scissors to clip the ends into inverted "v" shapes for a professional touch.
