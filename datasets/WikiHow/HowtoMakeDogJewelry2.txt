 Canvas works better than other types of materials for this project because it will be easier to sew through. Select a neutral color so that you can interchange flowers with the same collar.
 Sew it away from the buckle of the collar so that it does not interfere with how you put the collar on your dog.
 Sew the snap onto the base of the flower. If the flower has a plastic base, however, you may need to sew the snap onto a fabric petal near the base.
 The snap should be the same size and type as the snap used on the collar and the first flower. Use the socket end of the snap for each flower so that each snap can fit over the post end on the collar.
 You can snap and unsnap the different flowers onto your dog's collar as you please. This is especially useful if you have a dog that also wears doggy clothing, since you can change out the flowers to match the clothes.
