The moving paracord will be orange paracord while the black paracord only act as a core
Place the right paracord beneath the black paracord but on top of the left paracord.






Pull the left paracord across the above of the black paracord through the right loop formed just now.






Pull the knot as tight as possible to make it compact and in shape.
 vice versa and make the knot until it can cover your wrist completely.

 About the King Cobra , it is actually the same as the cobra's knot before.
