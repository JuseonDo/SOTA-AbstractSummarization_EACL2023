, For example, if you are designing a structure, you can imagine walking through it, and imagining what it would look like once it is built, with people moving around it giving you a guided tour.
 This allows you to notice any possible things or problems that may need to be changed in your design that may have slipped past unnoticed.


Alternatively, if you are dealing with a problem in the office, you can imagine sitting down and talking to that person and see what feelings come up. This helps you to interact better with them in real life as well as to allow deeper solutions your mind may offer to come to the surface.
