 This also appears as a part of the "Pride of the Salvage King"., The game itself will explain how to find this actually. You have to get to the forgotten caverns, but at day, you can't get to them because of the water hurricane. You will also discover that the treasure is only there at nights of full moon. The location of the forgotten caverns are E6 southeast. Dive at a night of full moon, with GG. (Look up at Nineball Island to help find a night of full moon, then go to Ciceros Strait and rest till midnight 3-5 times before diving.),
