 Are you working for the dark side, holy side or disciplined side? This choice will depend on a lot of what you can and can not accomplish in the future.;
,, The priest has naturally low armor but as you get further in the game, no one will want to approach you. AT 10, you also make your decision, holy, shadow or disciplined? Where do you spend your talent points, to become what?

,, With the addition of group-wide mana regen, both holy and shadow spec priests have usability in raids and instances. Discipline, for the most part, is still for pvp.
 So, being a shadow priest at the lower levels (10-40) is recommended for leveling, unless playing a healer is your passion. While playing the higher levels (40-70) It comes down to what you what role you wish your priest to play. If you enjoy running instances/raiding, Shadow and Holy make great choices for their respective DPS and healing abilities, while if PvP is what you enjoy then Discipline is great for survivability (arguably making the best flag-bearers in the game), while Shadow can take down targets quickly by dealing large amounts of damage in a short period of time. Holy is also viable, however their role in PvP tends to fall to sticking a short distance from main battles and using low cast time spells such as flash heal, renew and PW:S.
