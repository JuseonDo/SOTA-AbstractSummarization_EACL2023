Keep an eye on the butter. The heat from the water will soften it, but it can also cause the butter to melt if you let it sit too long.



Heat the water in a glass mixing bowl in the microwave if you do not have a double boiler. Place the butter in a mixing bowl that's slightly larger, and set it on top of the water-filled bowl to soften.
