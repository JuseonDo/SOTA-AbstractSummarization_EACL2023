 Choose a sweater with a cuff at the bottom of the sleeves and body. Buy it from the thrift store or use an old sweater.
 Use fabric scissors to limit the unraveling of the threads.
 You can discard the remainder of the sweater or use it for other projects.
 Cut a straight line from the top arm. It should start next to the armpit and extend horizontally across the sleeve.
 Subtract 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the measurement to ensure it will stay taught.


Sweater fabric stretches when pulled.
 You are going to make fold over bands for the top of your leg warmers.
, 1 side should already be hemmed and the other side should be cut. Repeat with the second piece.
, You will need to pin it carefully, ensuring that the circle does not get pinned together at any point.
 Use close stitches and a backstitch to prevent future fraying. , Attach buttons, ribbons or other embellishments to the outside of the fold-over. Wear over bear legs, leggings or boots.


Instead of making a foldover band on your leg warmers, you can fold the sweater over a piece of elastic that is measured for your calf size. Turn the leg warmer inside out, stretch the elastic band around and pin the sweater down. Stitch it into place, keeping the elastic free of the stitch.
