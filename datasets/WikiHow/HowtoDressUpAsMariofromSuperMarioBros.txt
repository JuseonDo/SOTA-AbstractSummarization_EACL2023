 These don't have to be in great shape, and if you don't have overalls, just wear a red shirt and blue pants/jeans.;
, It is helpful if you can draw or stick on a white circle and a red capital "M" in it.
 Use a ready-made mustache, or make one from fake fur/fluff. Another alternative is to draw one on if needed.
 Perhaps add some padding around the tummy for a more round appearance.
 These are trademark Mario.
 Mario isn't going to be running around in expensive shoes!

, Everyone loves a good Mario impression.
