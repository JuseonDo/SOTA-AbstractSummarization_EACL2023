,, If you don’t see a “Tools” option, tap “More.” You should see it now.
 Here you’ll find a list of all of the add-ons presently installed.
 This is different from uninstalling the add-on, as the add-on files will still be on your phone.


Choose this option if you're trying to determine whether or not using a certain add-on negatively impacts your browsing.
You’ll be able to re-enable any disabled add-on by returning to this location and selecting “Enable”.
 This is best if you’ve decided that the add-on is causing browsing issues, or if you just don’t want it on your phone anymore. Uninstalling will completely delete the add-on from your phone.
 Firefox may need to relaunch when certain add-ons are modified or removed.


If you are not prompted to restart the browser, you can continue browsing as normal.
