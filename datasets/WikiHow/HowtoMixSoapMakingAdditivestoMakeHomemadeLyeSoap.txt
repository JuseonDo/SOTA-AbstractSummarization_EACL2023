 Trace is when you raise your hand blender or spoon up out of the soap mixture and let the mixture drop on the mixture in the pot. If it shows the drop on top of your mixture then blends back in easily, you have reached thin soap trace. Do not let your soap trace get too thick. A hand blender can speed up your soap trace and become too thick before you realize it.;
, Add essential oil or fragrance first. Then add your herbs and color last. The reason for this is that some essential oils and scents can change the color you desire your homemade soap to have. Blend them well before pouring your soap mixture in your soap mold.
 The soap mixture has to be very thin trace for it to swirl properly.
 Then pour the colored soap mixture into your base soap mixture after you have poured it into your mold. Use a wooden spoon handle or dowel to adjust the color in the direction you want it.
 Insulate your homemade soap with blankets then let set 24 hours then cut your soap bars.
