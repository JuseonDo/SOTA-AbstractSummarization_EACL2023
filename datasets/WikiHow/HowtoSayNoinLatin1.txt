@summary
listen carefully to the sentence.

@summary
repeat the main verb and add non.

@summary
don't use this with long questions.
@article
 Determine the main verb.
 Some examples:

"Estne puella pulchra?"  "Non est."  ("Is the girl beautiful?"  "She is not.")
"Villam emit?"  "Non emit."  ("Does he buy a villa?"  "He buys not." )

, If you're dealing with a long sentence and multiple parts, this method isn't the best one.
