 Your guild needs to be in the top 3000 in order to do a torch battle. If not, you can only do boss battles.
 There will be a list of guilds that you can haul torches from. Depending on how many torches you get, that will be how many shards and honer badges you get.
 Look for a guild that has usually 75% or 50%. Tap haul.
 Tap haul. Depending on how high your hero's level is, it will take either a long time or a short amount of time.
 You only have 10 chances to haul the torches. Then you will have to wait 30 minutes until you have another chance to haul another torch.


Other guilds may start to haul torches away from you as well. If you want to get them back, you can battle that guild member and take the stolen torches back.
 The torch battle lasts at least 12 hours. Once the time limit is finished, claim your rewards.
