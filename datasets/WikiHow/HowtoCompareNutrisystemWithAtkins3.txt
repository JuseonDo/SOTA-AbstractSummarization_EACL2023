 NutriSystem does not limit the amount of carbs that you can eat. You are simply expected to eat mostly low-GI carbs. Atkins, on the other hand, restricts the quantity of carbs that you can consume.
 Both diets will require you to change your eating habits for life, but Atkins will require you to more strictly restrict your carb intake.
 NutriSystem provides you with prepared meals, while Atkins will require you to plan your own menus and cook your own meals.
