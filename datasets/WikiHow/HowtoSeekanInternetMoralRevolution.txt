gain respect, then take advantage of it by being a good influence as a member of an online community with a great reputation.~ avoid participating in not-so-great activities, because other people will see and then follow your wrong path.~ too many respected people today can not use their "creds" of respect to lead people along the right path -- because they're not on the right path themselves!

 A lot of the people online are probably just casually hanging out.;
, That is not going to be effective -- but think of which would be a better approach for people to perceive you as taking:~ Judging them, as if you're the moral or thought police like a book burner -- or instead:~ Reaching out to people, as a good-natured person, without cutting them down unnecessarily?

,, Mention that trolling is very dangerous to the other person and, since - as mentioned above - it can pressure kids to harm or kill themselves. But, don't tell your friends that they are just plain mean and selfish. Realize that people probably won't be willing to change their ways, especially if you tell them in a mean way: so be cautious of using your controlling behaviors that may seem like accusations and judging them.
 Calmly influence others to do your respectful implied desires, without telling them directly, and without making them feel threatened, without calling names like "troller, mean or hater". Accusing one of "trolling" if that person is just expressing honest opinions in discussions is not helpful, and then you have offended him/her and may be dismissed/ignored or called a "troller, mean or hater" yourself.
 Such tactics can not influence people to do well because they will be angry and disagreeing with you.
 Don't call them (or imply that they are) silly or childish, for example. Just be thoughtful or kind -- and thank them for cooperating in advance so that you may be influential.
 Online drama events, in theory, could have the potential for people to learn from their lessons.
