 Buy plums that were grown locally or in a similar climate, so that you ensure it will grow in your hardiness zone. It is best not to use early-maturing varieties, because the seeds are less likely to develop in these types.;
, Choose the tastiest one to try to plant, since plum seeds often carry on the traits of a parent plant very well.
, The seed inside the pit will dry and shrink away, and you will be able to save it more easily. The shell will also crack more easily when dried., Place the pit horizontally between the two ends. Crack it gently.


Take care not to crack too hard. A smashed seed can’t be planted.
 This is what you need to sprout and plant.
 Drop your seed into it. If it sinks, you can germinate it, and if it floats, you should continue cracking pits until you get a viable seed., Use room temperature water.
 Wet the soil so that it is moist, but not overly wet.
 Shake the container so that the seed moves deeper into the loose soil.
 Place the jar or bag in the refrigerator to start the stratification process. This cool, sprouting process germinates the seeds so that they can be planted and grown into a tree.
 It is recommended that you plant at least two trees so that cross-pollinating varieties will come to fruit.
 Choose a slightly sheltered place that you can mulch and cover to avoid frost—a killer of young plum trees. It will need to be in full sun.
 Adding soil will also help it drain better.
 It should be a deep pot with drainage holes.
 Take care not to break these roots when transplanting.
 Create a small mound of soil in the center. Place the seed atop it and spread the roots around the mound.
 Space your trees about 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.6m) apart., Water deeply before the ground dries out. Your plum tree should start bearing fruit in three to five years.
