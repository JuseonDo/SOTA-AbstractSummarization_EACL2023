, Keeping the heat medium-low prevents the pancakes from cooking too fast and keeps them from turning brown. Remember, you want rainbow pancakes, not brown!








, You should see lots of bubbles on the top and be able to handle the bottom of the pancake without batter flowing everywhere into the pan. That is how you know when to flip.
,, Serve and enjoy!
