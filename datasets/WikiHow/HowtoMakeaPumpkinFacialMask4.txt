If you let oily skin become dry, it will start to produce even more oils to compensate.This mask contains ingredients that may help control excess oil production without drying out your skin. Some of the ingredients are also helpful when it comes to treating acne.
 Crack an egg open into a small cup or bowl, then beat it briskly with a fork or mini whisk until it is pale and frothy. Egg yolks help hydrate skin, which is important even for oily skin types. The yolks also contain zinc, which can help treat acne.Egg whites help tighten the skin and close up pores, which can help reduce acne., Pumpkin is rich in vitamins and minerals.
