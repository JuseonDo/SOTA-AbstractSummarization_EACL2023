 Unlike owls, human eyesight is not as great, but that doesn't mean you can't observe everything around you. Take note of little changes; be curious and learn what they mean.;
, Try to learn things by yourself instead of asking others. Make this a habit for every time you walk into a room.
 While owls aren't actually that smart, they're a symbol of wisdom. Have your own brand of wisdom, though. Look between the lines, seek out the grey in a black-and-white situation, and just generally think more about your actions.
 Owls are not afraid of darkness because they have night vision.
 Get to know about their behavior. If you have owls near you, watch them.
 Learn to appreciate nature. Most owls live in coniferous forests, deserts, mountains, and plains and like to nest in high trees. Try exploring places like these.
 The wide-eyed, focused stare of an owl is well known. Also listen carefully to what people say.
