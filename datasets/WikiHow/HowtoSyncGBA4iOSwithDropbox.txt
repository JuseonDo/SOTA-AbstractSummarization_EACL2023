,, Under the "General" tab, go to Date and Time and change the date to 18th February, 2014. If you don’t do this, then the GBA4iOS will NOT work.
, Download version 1.6.2 if you are on iOS 6 or earlier.
 After downloading the app, you will be asked to open it.
 When you open GBA4iOS, you will be able to see a plus (+) sign at the top left of your device.
 When you tap the plus logo, it will take you to the games library. You can pick any gaming title you like (whichever ones appear on the list, that is).
 Now, you will be able to view several options; one of them will be the "Save to Dropbox." After you press on this option, it will ask you to enter your Dropbox details after opening a new window.
