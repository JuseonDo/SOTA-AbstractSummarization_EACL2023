 Usually, this is an image that you want to enlarge, but it is too pixelated or low-resolution to use in its current form. You can also scan an image or drawing onto the computer using a scanner.


If you are scanning an image into your computer, increase the contrast, so that it will be easier to trace.
, Select “File” and “Place” to bring your photo or image into the program. Make sure your image covers a majority of your screen, so that you can work on it in detail.
 Lock the first image layer by clicking the little square lock. The image will stay in one place while you work on it.
 Click on your Pen tool. You are going to trace your image, so that it will create a sharp, vector image.
 Choose the weight of the line that fits the line you are going to draw. Lines that are in the foreground should be thicker, while lines in the background should be thinner.


Always use black outlines and white backgrounds during this process. You can change the colors later.
 Click the second point at the end of a straight section to create a straight line. Create curved lines by clicking a second point and dragging the line until it matches the smooth curve of the image.


Use the handles to adjust the Bezier curve. They can be adjusted indefinitely.
, Remember that you want to create as few points as possible, while remaining as true to the shape as possible. This is a skill that will improve with practice., You can group these elements together later on. Fill in the colors when you are finished. You can add colors on the same layer or different layers.
 Save your file as a vector image, such as AI or EPS. Use this new vector image for scaling.
