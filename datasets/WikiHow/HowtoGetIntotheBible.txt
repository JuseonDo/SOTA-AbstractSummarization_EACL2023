  God wants to give you wisdom and He wants to give it to you in abundance (James 1:5) but you must ask in faith (James 1:6-7).;
,  Some Bibles have the sayings of Jesus in red.  Jesus said, "Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away." Over the years I have found that His sayings have kept me on the straight and narrow path when many situations and people have tried to get me off track.,  So you should also read books by good Christian authors.  You should realize that books with questions will stimulate the mind and help you to think through the Word and understand doctrine better. ,  I go over and over the same scriptures that God is revealing to my heart.  After a while I can quote the verses and help to encourage other Christians.
  So many people like the Psalms because it consoles them.  I like the proverbs because it says things like, "Establish your career before you get married." in proverbs 24:27.  And God will bless you without sorrow (Proverbs 10:22) and Proverbs 8:17 says that God loves those that love Him.  From Proverbs 13:15 and Proverbs 12:8 we see that God wants us to work smarter, not harder.,,  Here you will see Luke reveal a lot of things that are not in the other Gospels.,,  I Corinthians 2:14 says that the Holy Spirit was given to us to teach us what is freely given to us of God.,  The more I listen, the more I learn.  Faith comes by hearing (Romans 10:17).
  First John is considered the book of love.  First and Second Peter are considered to be Books written by a strong pastor.  First and Second Timothy are books written to an evangelist. Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians were written from Jail and Paul had a lot of time to pray and these books have a lot of Revelation in them.,  I recommend that you read the Bible every night before you go to bed.
