 Music Tag runs on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.;
, This can be done by manually selecting tracks or selecting a directory containing music tracks.
, You can browse a file’s existing tags by clicking on the file in the music file list.
 Music Tag will start downloading the relevant track data and display its progress in a progress bar which will appear.
 While you wait, any tracks whose data has already been downloaded will appear with a red file icon next to their name. You can proceed to Step 7 with those files now or wait for downloading to finish completely.
 Once music data has been downloaded for a track, Music Tag will conveniently display matching music data when the track is clicked. Music Tag will often provide you with multiple possibilities allowing you to use the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ arrows to choose the match that you prefer.
 Like most other music tagging software, you can manually edit or add tags so that everything is as you would prefer before finalising.
 Music Tag will not modify any of your music files until you are completely satisfied with the changes that it has suggested. When you are happy with the changes, click the ‘Save Changes’ button in the top right corner.
 Now that the changes have been saved, your library will be populated with all of the new tag information. You can now enjoy the added convenience of having your music tagged.
