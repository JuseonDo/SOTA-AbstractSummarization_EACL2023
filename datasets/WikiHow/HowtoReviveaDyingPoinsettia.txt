Also with your finger or a rod of some sort pull out one pistol or stamen from each bract; this increases color in your plant


This will end up making your plant look like a stick for a while, due to the pulling of the dead leaves, but this is perfectly natural. Then you can choose to put it in a dark place for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours of light (this is optional, it just adds color to the Bracts and helps with flower production - increasing bracts (colored leafs).
