 You will need several dolls (that you can take the heads off of), a utility knife, weights, a vase or tank, red glass beads, water, glue, red dye, and a wooden spoon.
 The number of doll heads is up to you. You can use old Barbies or other types of dolls. Dolls can also be purchased cheaply at dollar stores. Make sure you are not using a doll that somebody cares about; the heads will be very challenging to reattach to the body.


It is best to use doll heads that are hollow because it will be easier to cut the eyes out and it looks spookier.
 Use utility knife to cut the eyes out of the head. Be very careful, as utility knives are incredibly sharp.
 Vary the weights from head to head so they don’t all sink to the bottom of the tube. Leave some heads without weights. Construction adhesive (like PowerGrab or Gap) works best for this project.


Weights can be bought at a hardware store. You can also substitute weights for rocks.
 This will give the doll a bloody, scary look. Let the paint dry.
 Make sure that the vase or tank is large enough to hold all of the doll heads you have made. The vase can be any shape but some typical styles are rectangular or round.

Vases can be substituted for actual aquariums if you have one you wish to use.
 Use red glass beads for an extra creepy look.
 If desired, add red dye to the water and still with a wooden spoon. This will make the water look like it is blood.
 Let them sink to the bottom or float on the top. Adjust their positions for the spookiest possible effect. Make sure you put the aquarium somewhere where there is enough light to admire it by.


If you are using the doll head aquarium as an indoor decoration, use it as a center piece on a table or place it next to a bowl of candy.
