 LPs and maxi-singles should always be shipped in a sturdy, cardboard mailer (with cardboard inserts) specifically designed for shipping 12-inch records. The length and width of the mailer should both be between 12 ½ to 13 inches (33.0 cm). The height or thickness will depend on the number of discs being shipped. When packing an LP, follow these steps:;
,, If you have a plastic LP outer cover, place the jacket in the cover, with the disc beside it. This step is very important as it will prevent potential seam splits to the album jacket that may occur from the disc sliding back and forth during transit. (With a sealed LP, you obviously will not remove the disc from the jacket, but you will want to ensure that enough cardboard inserts are placed around the album in order to prevent the disc from sliding back and forth inside its sealed jacket.)

,, If there is any sliding around of the box contents, insert additional cardboard inserts until all is snug and tight.
 For the record to arrive safe and sound, it is imperative that the box contents be securely cushioned with no movement ability!
