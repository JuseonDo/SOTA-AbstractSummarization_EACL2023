 If the map is in color. Normally, green means ground and blue means water. This won't help much for directions to a hotel, but can help if you're looking for a beach or lake.
 If there isn't a key, it is important to know basic land-forms like roads, buildings, and mountains. If you don't know:


Roads and highways are normally represented by yellow or gray lines.

Hold the map so that the tower in front of you is at the top of your map, and the marked street is below where you are, on the map, so that all other points on the map represent all that you see around you.
, You can do so by visiting the nearer places first before the further places.
