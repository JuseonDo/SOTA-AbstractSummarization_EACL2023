take a deep breath and try to clear your mind of all things that trouble you.

then, as you would speak to a friend or someone you really trust, unloosen your tongue and tell god all that bothers you.

don't try to be proud/boastful, or pray anything fancy: try to address everything big in your life -- but nothing is too little to ask about or for help and wisdom.

remember that god has his own reasons, for his timeline, and so trust him in that.

: vaguely by name) then perhaps you should start by just locking yourself in your room. This will help you to feel that you are now alone with the Sustainer.;
, Then, say aloud, "Hi, God. I saved this time for You. Will You please come and be close to me?" This may feel absurd at first but know that God truly listens and cares. Remember, "Ask and you shall receive." There is also nothing wrong with asking for God to talk to you.
 Or, tell Him something you thank Him for that has recently happened to you (i.e.: thank Him if your team won a big game, someone you like asked you out, or you made a new friend). God listens and understands--always--so you won't have to feel silly.
 Prayer should not be only self-centered.
 You may not get exactly what you want when you want it, but He does everything for a reason.


Also realize that whatever happens may be a result of a "third person(s)" involved in personal actions/inaction, opposite of some of your prayers, and God does not contravene disagreeable parties. They, having free will, might not follow Christ or God, nor stop their misconduct that can involve you. It could, thus, depend (regrettably) on them.
 Pray for all your problems in your life right now, and other stuff that is really important to you. You can try making a prayer journal, if you aren't comfortable with praying, or you would like to record your petitions and their results.
 Though this may seem obvious, pray twice or more a day to God. Make sure the words come from your heart Imagine yourself coming before him and seeing his majesty as you pray. Worship his majesty! Yet, He wants to be your best friend forever , who is more than just and right, Holy God, The Judge, for "He is Love". He wants you to pray in the Spirit as well as in understanding. He wants you to pray for other people so that they will repent and so that they will be healed.
