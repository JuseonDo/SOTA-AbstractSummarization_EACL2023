 If you change your habits and the problem remains, move on to the next method and seek medical attention.;
, If you must drink, sip only a small amount. Avoid chugging water during the evening., These substances, including caffeinated drinks, soda and alcohol stimulate your bladder. This should reduce the urge to pee.
, If you suffer from swollen ankles or retain water in the legs, wear compression stockings during the day to reduce this tendency., Weak pelvic muscles can lead to incontinence or an urge to urinate. If you’ve recently had a baby, try to do these exercises at least three times a day.
