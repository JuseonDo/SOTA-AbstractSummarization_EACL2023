 Frag mines work best. Get a good collection of at least 20 before entering an area that may contain Super Mutant Overlords.;
, A rifle of any kind will suffice.
 Save before entering.
 Take aim with V.A.T.S. Lock onto the weapon the Overlord is carrying (generally a tri-beam laser rifle).
 Get in two good shots, at least. This will break the gun in the Overlord's hands, rendering them defenseless.
 The Overlord will not flee like regular Mutants, but instead attack with its bare hands.
 Wait for it to plow into it, then perform the same maneuver again.
