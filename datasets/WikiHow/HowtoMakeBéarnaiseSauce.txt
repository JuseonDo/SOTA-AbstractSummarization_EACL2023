 You want about 1T liquid remaining.;
, You may strain the shallots out, however they will add more flavour in the sauce.
 Reduce the heat to maintain heat but don't allow the water to boil.
, Whisk the eggs for 1 or 2 minutes until they have visibly thickened and increased in volume. When you lift the whisk, it should form a thick ribbon-like trail.
 When the butter in incorporated, add the next cube until all are combined into the sauce. The sauce will become thinner with each addition of butter, but will thicken as you continue whisking.
 Serve without delay. It may stay warm for up to 20 minutes, but no longer as it may be a food poisoning risk.


If you must wait, cover the sauce with cling film so the sauce is in contact with the film to prevent a skin forming and keep warm. Whisk again before serving.
