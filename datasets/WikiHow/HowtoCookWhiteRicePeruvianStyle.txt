 Let the oil warm as you prepare.;
, This just takes a few seconds. If you aren’t sure whether or not the oil is hot enough, look for tiny surface ripples or place your hand a few inches above the pan and gauge the radiant heat.
 If you don’t have a sieve with small enough holes, rinse it in a cheesecloth or dish towel.
 Make sure it mixes well with the garlic.
 Salt the water if desired; alternatively, add a cube of chicken bouillon to the water and let it dissolve as the water heats.
 It only needs to boil for a few seconds.
 Note that simmering rice has a tendency to create white foam that bubbles out onto your stovetop; if foam is a problem for you, set the lid askew until the mixture gets drier, then cover completely.
 The grains should be plump and soft, and not pasty.
