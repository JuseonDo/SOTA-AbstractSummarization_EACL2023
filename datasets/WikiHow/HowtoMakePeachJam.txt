 Run them through a food processor, in batches if needed. Do not blend until smooth, but rather until chunky. Remember that the pieces will break down in the saucepan.;
, Stir constantly. Make sure there are no clumps of sugar, as they will solidify withing the peaches and burn.
 Continue stirring, folding the mixture over and clearing the bottom of the pan.
 Bubbles and form should begin to form at the tops. Continue mixing or the sugars and fruit will stick to the pan and burn.
 Let it regain some solidity. Continue stirring as it cools.
