,, Depending on weather conditions take shower, if feasible or at least make yourself fresh by face wash.
 However, it is advisable to use natural perfumes made from flowers or sandalwood.
 This is especially true if you have poor glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus.
 Your clothing should make you feel tidy, fit and light.
 It does not matter even if this prayerful feeling is artificial or arbitrary in the beginning, for later it will become natural and pleasing.
 This will ensure that don't feel tired or breathless for the duration of walking meditation you have decided to do.
 Try to synchronize it with your steps. This recital is actually in mind and silent. No audible sound is produced.


This becomes easy and pleasurable after a few practices.
 It's okay to remember anybody or any work while you are in walking meditation. You may answer a call also. Don't suppress any thought or any feeling. After you finish the call, resume reciting the name of God or the spiritual entity again.
 But silent recitation of the name of God or the spiritual concept should be practiced with top priority. Talk on trivial maters should be avoided with mutual understanding and collective decision.
 After the meditation is over, when your frame of mind is fresh and positive, return to the day to day activities. You will find you have multiplied enthusiasm and creativity.
