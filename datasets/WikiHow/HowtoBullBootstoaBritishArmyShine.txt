 Getting your brand new boots out of the stores and then spending hours bulling them is just going to ruin them. Wear them in for a few weeks if possible.


If you don't have time to wear them in, put them on and submerge them in hot water for 20 minutes or so. Then walk around; this will help speed up the process. Note they will take time to dry.

, Again wear them whilst doing this but try not to scruff the toe or chip the boot; this will affect the end out come, so don't take them on the assault course.
 Selvyt cloths are a good choice. Wash it a few times, and brush it with a nail brush and washing up liquid will make it softer and less likely to scratch your boot. Note that this can be done whilst doing first steps.
 Get some black polish, but for a deeper shine, also buy a tin of dark brown to top the look off with.
 You'll need a small bowl of water, your black and brown polish, Silver, and the boots.
 Make sure it is flat on your fingers; twisting the access can help to tighten on fingers.
 Wipe it until it's covered, using a circular motion of an inch diameter. Rub in until you think the polish is drying.
 Do this by dipping your cloth on water and repeating the last step.
 Each time, use less and less new black polish.
 Do as you have done for the black layers; again stop when you think it's drying and removing any left over polish with water. Brown polish seems to be softer than black, so it fills the tiny holes you want to get rid off to make the best shine.
 You don't want your hard work to crack and fall off.
 Repeat daily until you get the results you want. This normally takes a week of around an hour a night to see good long lasting results.
