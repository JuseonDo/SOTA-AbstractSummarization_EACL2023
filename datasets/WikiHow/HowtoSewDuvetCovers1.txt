 You need two pieces of fabric large enough to cover the duvet, plus one inch extra on the length and width to allow for a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam.


You want to allow ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) extra for each seam you need to make to piece the duvet cover together. Allow slightly more than that if you want a looser fit for your duvet cover or if your duvet is extra thick.;
, Look for stain- and pill-resistant materials that wash easily.



You can plan on making one side all the same fabric, or you can plan on piecing it together like a quilt top from a variety of fabrics. How to sew duvet covers is entirely up to you, and it’s a project that can let you express your artistic talents.
,,,, Dry it in the dryer. This removes any sizing and helps set the color dyes. If the fabric is going to shrink, it does it in this first wash cycle.
