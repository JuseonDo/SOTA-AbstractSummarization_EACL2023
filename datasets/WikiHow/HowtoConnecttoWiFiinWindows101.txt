 The router acts like a man in the middle, connecting you to the internet. If it's off, then you won't be able to connect to that network.
 If your device is able to connect to a wireless network through a wireless adapter, then you'll see a signal/broadcast radio wave icon with a star above it.

If your device is wireless capable but the icon is missing, then go to "Settings > Personalization > Taskbar > Select which icons appear on the taskbar" and slide the switch next to "Network" to "On".
You can also go to "Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Show available networks".
 See if the "Wi-Fi" tile is colored at the bottom of the pane.,, Either check or uncheck the box next to "Connect automatically".,,

If the router is WPS enabled, press the button on the router to connect.
, You'll be asked "Do you want allow your PC to be discoverable by other PCs and devices on this network". Clicking away will choose the "No" option.
