 Buy those that are firm, with smooth skin. Stay away from any potatoes that are wrinkled, soft or green.


Buy red potatoes in the produce section of your grocery store, or at produce stands and farmer's markets.;
,, Scrub off any dirt and let them dry for a few minutes before you begin cutting them.


Wash red potatoes only when you are ready to use them. If you wash them and then store them, they can begin to decay or rot quickly.
 Keeping the sizes even will ensure they finish cooking at the same time.
 Add olive oil and toss the potatoes until they are all coated with oil.


Use any olive oil that you have on hand. Since they will be roasting for a long time, there is no need to use expensive or exotic oil.
 Mix the potatoes with those seasonings until they are evenly coated with the oil, salt and pepper.
 You can use any herbs or flavors you like. Popular recipes call for thyme, rosemary, sage, oregano, cayenne pepper and others.
 Try chopped onions, garlic cloves, bell pepper, celery, squash, carrots or other vegetables that roast well.
 Allow the potatoes to roast for 60 minutes. They should be crispy and brown on the outside and soft on the inside.


Overcook your potatoes if you like them extra crispy. Leaving them in the oven for an extra 15 minutes will give them a dramatic, crunchy texture and a roasted taste without burning them.
 They should be shiny with oil, crispy and hard on the ends and smelling wonderful.
, You can microwave them for another meal, lunch the next day or a quick and nutritious snack.
