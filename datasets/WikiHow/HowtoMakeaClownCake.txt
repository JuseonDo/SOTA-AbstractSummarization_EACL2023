 ;
, Use the two side pieces that you carved out from the original cake and cut a third piece off from the opposite ends of each piece. The curved triangle will become the complete hat and the small piece will be the hat rim




, Use a smooth, palette knife to give it a solid stroke all around.
 Use the new blue frosting with the hat.
 Make the rim by lining it with some dolly mixtures.
 Put a dab of buttercream on two Smarties candies and stick it on the eyes for eyeballs.
, Make it quite large, as it should dominate the cake to give it the real "clown feel". Place this on the cake for the nose.
 Use white and pink marshmallows around the cake's bottom for the ruff (or collar).
 Candles can be added around the face for a birthday cake.
