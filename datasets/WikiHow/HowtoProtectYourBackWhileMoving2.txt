;
, Pushing will use stomach muscles and limit the strain on your back.
 Do not twist or turn while you are pushing an object.
 This will put your weight behind it and create some momentum.
 Just as when you are lifting heavy objects, bending at the waist in order to push will put too much strain on your spine.


Squat to get lower if you must bend down while pushing.
