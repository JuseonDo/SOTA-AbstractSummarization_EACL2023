 Flying enemies typically stay above you and try to charge you. Stay away from the underside and this will be obsolete. However, they are able to charge diagonally.;
, Short-swords are not advisable for this as they only go forward.
 This is usually a good option. Charges and projectiles can be avoided by jumping (Pressing the space bar, but you know that already.) which propels you upward, over the enemy/launched attack.(This also works for ground enemies, but be aware that most walking enemies/slimes jump too.)

, The smart projectiles are the ones that follow you, such as Servants of Cthulhu or Servants of Ocram, etc. Broadsword are used against them, helping you to not take as many hits. (Sometimes the smart projectiles drop hearts, they can be exploited for easy healing.)
