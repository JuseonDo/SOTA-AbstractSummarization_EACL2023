, This will cost you 100 city coins.
 A list of available crops will appear. Click your preferred crop, and drop it on the empty farm plot. The cost of the crop will be deducted from your City Coins balance.


Note: The amount of goods the crops produce and the length of time the crop takes to grow depends on the crop. Strawberries take five minutes to grow and produce 15 goods, whilst eggplant takes one hour to grow and produces 30 goods.
 You will get your goods and some experience stars (XP). One energy will be required to harvest each crop.
