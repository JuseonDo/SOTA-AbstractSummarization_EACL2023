 Do no microwave the entire head of garlic, as this can ruin it for later nights. Simply remove the cloves you plan on using right then.
 With the garlic on a small plate, heat them up briefly on high. You should notice the skin billowing and loosening.
 Cut the root end off with a knife and the skin will slide off easily.
