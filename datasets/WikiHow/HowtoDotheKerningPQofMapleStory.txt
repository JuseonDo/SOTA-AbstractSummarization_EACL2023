 This can be found in any town in Maple World. The symbol for this Party Quest is the green slime. It will only show when you are level 21.;
, Don't jump around too much. Eventually you will get into one. When your party has 3-4 members, ask which channel you are supposed to be in. When you get there, ask if you are tracking, ACing, or surfing. To track, you need to know the name of a character in a PQ right then. AC is auto-clicker and it means you can't leave the map. If you are surfing, you need to change channels quickly when your leader asks you to.
 Click on Cloto and she will tell you how many coupons to give her.
 When you have the right amount, talk to Cloto and give your leader the pass she gives you. Then, wait for your leader to clear the stage.
 3 should be occupied. There are also 4 combinations of 3 people on the 4 ropes. One of these will clear the stage. When it is clear, go through the portal into the next stage.
 They are numbered according to the amount of kittens on each platform. Do all the combinations in numbered order to make things quicker. The combos are 123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345. One of these will clear the stage. If one of your party members disconnected, you will be given a Platform Puppet, which can be used to replace a player.
 This can be quickly finished with a player with a high mobbing skill.
 Talk to Cloto.
