 Wet your hands with water and place the cut shrimp in the bottom of the box form.
 Wet your hands, which will help mold the sushi rice. Take a palmful of the sushi rice and place it over the fish eggs, pressing it firmly around all edges of the box form. Spread another layer of fish eggs followed by a final layer of sushi rice., Place it on top of the box, pressing down firmly. Rotate the box form a few times as you do so as to evenly compact the form. Carefully remove the box lid, gently placing the newly molded box sushi on your cutting board. Cut the molded sushi into six equal sized pieces., In the tuna version of hako sushi, the sushi rice is mixed a combination of sesame seeds and seaweed called furikake. So take five ounces of rice and thoroughly mix it with two tablespoons of furikake., Rotate and press evenly as before with the shrimp, ending by again cutting into six equal pieces., Sushi is just as much about looks as taste, after all.
