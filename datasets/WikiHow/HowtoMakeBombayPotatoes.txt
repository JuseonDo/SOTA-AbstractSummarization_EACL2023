 Use a colander to drain the water and then run cold water over the potatoes. When they're cooled, peel, and cut them into 2 inch (5.1 cm) sized pieces.;
,, Allow the seeds to splutter. It's a good idea to keep the lid on for this step since the seeds may jump all over if you don't.
 Fry the onions until they are golden brown.
 Give a quick stir to release the flavors from them.
