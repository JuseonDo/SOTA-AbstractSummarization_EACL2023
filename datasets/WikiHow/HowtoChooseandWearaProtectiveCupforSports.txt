@article
 The jockstrap, brief or sliding-short will have a pouch to house the cup. There will be elastic, metal snaps or a Velcro closure to keep the cup in place in the pouch.
 This maximizes their protectiveness by completely encasing the male genitals and allowing the genitals to be held tightly against the body. However, if you want to wear something underneath, only a thin pair of nylon/spandex briefs should be worn. EXAMPLE: Under Armor Compression Shorts.
 A loose fitting cup will allow the impact of a blow or hit to slam the cup into the testicles, causing pain and possible injury. If your cup-jockstrap or cup-brief does not hold your cup firmly and tightly against your body you can wear a pair of tight fitting nylon/spandex athletic briefs over them.

,, With banana-shaped cup, allow penis to hang down.
, Jockstrap can be washed in machine but should be air-dried to not damage elastic. Cup should be washed by hand with warm water and soap and never in machine.
