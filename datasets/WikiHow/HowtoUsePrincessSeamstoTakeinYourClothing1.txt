 Make sure to have a pencil and paper ready to record these.;
, This is the Top of Shoulder/Base of Neck to Apex measurement.
 This is the distance between your nipples.
 The spot referred to as the Ribcage in sewing is located right underneath your breast where the cups of your bra end. So, you are measuring the distance from your nipple to there.
 This is not necessarily the spot where your pants sit. It is the spot where you bend if you you lean over, right above the belly button.
, It's where the elastic top of a bikini style panty will usually sit.


If you are wanting to also adjust your garment around the largest part of your rear end you will want to include the Lower Hip as well. Measure approximately 6" down from the Mid Hip to find the Lower Hip measurement.
