A new quest should be added to your journal called: "A Strange Door" 24 in-game hours after you install the expansion. If this doesn't happen, then try reinstalling the expansion pack. You can also head to the Strange Door before the game hours have elapsed and you have received the quest, but you will not get a quest marker.;
,, This is called the "Niben Bay." If you can't find the water, then look to the right of the Bay Roan Stables.
 You should be able to see it from the shore of the Niben Bay.


Once you've arrived, a guard will speak to you. A strange voice will come out of the portal in the large head statue; after that you are able to go through it and enter the Shivering Isles.
 Speak to him, and upon agreeing to become Lord Sheogorath's champion, you will be allowed to enter the Fringe of the Shivering Isles.
