, Try to get something that is around 8 by 12 inches (20.32 by 30.48 centimeters) or 9 by 13 inches (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters)., Measure out the old fashioned oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar. For extra flavor, add some ground nutmeg. Put everything into a large bowl, and mix together until evenly combined.
 You can use another bowl, or a large, glass measuring cup. Beat everything together until the yolks break, and you get an even color. There should be no streaks or swirls.
 Keep stirring with a whisk or spatula until everything is evenly combined.
 Popular choices include berries or apples. You can also use 2 cups (200 grams) worth of other ingredients as well, such as chopped nuts or bananas.
 Gently sway the baking dish from side to side. This will help spread your mixture evenly across the baking dish, and help everything settle.
 The oats should be set; they should not jiggle much when you move them.
 For extra flavor, drizzle some milk or honey over the oatmeal. You can also top it with ground cinnamon or raisins. If you end up having any leftovers, put them into the refrigerator.
