 Open hours can often be found on a teacher's website or in the syllabus, and if you choose to email them, make sure you include a specific time and be flexible to their plans if you can.
 Feel confident in your ability to talk to them. Write down some notes ahead of time so that you have an idea of what to say, and approach them with confidence. Your teachers are there to help you, and they want you to succeed!

, Showing your teacher that you have a vested interest in furthering your education lets them know that you are serious about doing well.
 Your teachers want you to succeed, and if you've told them that you aren't happy with your grades, it's a great idea to follow up by showing an interest in improvement.
 Your teacher knows what they're talking about, so if they give you tips on how to succeed, follow them! Don't be afraid to talk to your teacher or schedule follow-up meetings if you need extra help.
