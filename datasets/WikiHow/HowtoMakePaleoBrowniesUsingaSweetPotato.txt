 About one inch tall is the best height.


Be aware that if your brownies are too thin, they could overcook and if it is too tall, it could have an undercooked middle.
 Remove the tin and cool for 5-10 minutes before carefully removing the brownie cake from the tin. You can cut it into quarters and remove one part at a time, if the bottom sticks a little. Leave the brownie cake to cool down before cutting.
