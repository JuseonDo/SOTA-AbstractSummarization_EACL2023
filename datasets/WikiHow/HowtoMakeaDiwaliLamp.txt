, This will make a hollow.
 Check that the tea light candle can fit into the hole; if not, keep shaping.



For a round lamp, leave the shape as it is but raise the rim edge with more clay in a circle around the top.
For a star shaped lamp, pinch the sides of the top of the bowl with your forefinger and thumb. This will indent the top, creating a star shape. Six indents will create a six-sided star, five indents will create a five-sided star.
 Try to keep this as even as possible.
 These allow the light to shine through. Decide where you will place the holes evenly around the bowl, marking each spot with a small nick in the clay to check for evenness all the way around the bowl. Then press the holes out with the end of a paintbrush or pencil. Use the tool to make each circle evenly rounded.
, Glue costume gems, sequins, tiny decorative mirrors and glitter in place. The rim can be painted a different color from the decorative designs on the side, such as gold or silver, to help increase the glow of the candlelight.


Use really rich colors for the decorations; you can't be too opulent!

, Once dried, the tea light candle can be placed inside and the lamp is ready to use.
