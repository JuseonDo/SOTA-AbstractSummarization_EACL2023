 Most machines will need some time heat up first. You will also want to tamp the filter basket to eliminate any air pockets.

For the best taste, grind the coffee beans just before you brew them.;
, You need the mug to be large enough to hold about 10 ounces (300 milliliters). This will give you enough room for the milk and foam., How much vanilla you use is up to you. Start with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) if this is your first time making a latte, then add more as needed., Place the steaming wand tip at the surface of the milk. Turn the dial counterclockwise to begin heating the milk.


Use a food thermometer to gauge temperature.
If you like your lattes extra hot, you can go up to 175°F (80°C). Don't go above 180°F (82°C) or it will scald you., Listen for a light hissing sound. This is the key to creating that perfect froth. You want to create something thick, like shaving cream., Be sure to wipe the steaming wand with a clean, damp cloth immediately after steaming milk., Place a spoon inside the pitcher, with the edge resting right against the rim. Carefully pour the steamed milk into the espresso, using the spoon to hold back the foam.
 Once you have the mug filled to your liking, use the spoon to scoop the foam out of the pitcher. Gently place the foam right on the surface of the latte., Add a sprinkle of some cinnamon or cocoa powder on top of the foam. For something sweeter and fancier, add a drizzle of caramel or chocolate syrup instead.
