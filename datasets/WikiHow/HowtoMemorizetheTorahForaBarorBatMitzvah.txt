, Remember that the Torah has NO vowels and symbols, so you need 2 copies of your Torah portion, 1 with and 1 without the vowels and symbols to practice with.
 Usually, the cantor works with you on learning the words, the melody, and the actions that go with the reading of the Torah.
 Enter your date of birth, being sure to mark whether you were born before or after sunset, and your Hebrew date of birth and your Torah and Haftorah portions will appear on the screen. Write them down and show them to the rabbi and cantor, and highlight the parts you'll read. If your birthday is in the summer, ask the rabbi and cantor what to do, because most rabbis and cantors don't have summer Bar Mitzvahs and Bat Mitzvahs.
 If you only want the book, ask the cantor if he or she has tapes or CDs with your Torah portion so you can listen to it.
 Once you've got the first line, start chanting along with the recording. With daily practice, you'll have the whole thing memorized and you'll be able to sing along with the recording.
 Get as big an audience as possible, so you'll get used to performing in front of a crowd.
