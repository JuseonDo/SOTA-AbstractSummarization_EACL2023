As a general rule of thumb most manufacturers do not recommend using alcohol or ammonia based cleaners which can have a chemical reaction with the device surface. The other hazard comes from detergents that use abrasives as the cleaning agent.;
,

, Micro cleaning cloths are the best but you can use any soft cloth that does not replace the smudges and debris with lint. Spray a small amount of your cleaning solution on to the cloth.
 (Repeating this step maybe required if this is the first time you have cleaned your 2 year old device). Once you have the debris on the rag start turning the rag to a fresh surface and continue to wipe up any leftover cleaning solution. Each time you turn the rag to a new surface wipe with just a little less pressure on the screen. At this stage you are really polishing away any streaks left by the cleaning solution.
 We recommend that you rinse or wash the cloth out occasionally. Our clothes are dryer safe but we tend to lose them with the single sock so air drying is our preferred method.
