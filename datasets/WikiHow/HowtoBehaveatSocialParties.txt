 If you are not in a good mood, it can even spoil others' moods also.;
, If you are attending a religious gathering or function, a nice suit or dress would be an appropriate choice. If it is a friend's party, you can probably wear more casual clothing.
, Parties are great places to meet new people and form new friendships!

, There will be plenty of time for eating, and the most action in a party usually happens near the beginning. Have some conversations with people and be social!

, A stained dress won't impress anyone!

, People will see this as being very polite and considerate., Make sure the child is behaving properly at all times. Introduce them to other children that may be there so that they can talk with people their own age.
 Having an argument break out in the middle of everything is not what you want to happen!

, Give others compliments to be polite, and stay away from saying anything which could be interpreted as an insult.
 Have fun! If there are times to be serious, or it is a serious event, make sure that you are acting appropriately for the occasion. If it's a more casual party, feel free to enjoy yourself!

, Do not forget to say thanks for inviting.
