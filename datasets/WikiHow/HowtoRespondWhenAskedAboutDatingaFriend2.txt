if things become awkward between you and your friend, consider the reason.
@article
 If you have reason to suspect he or she likes you, even though you don't like him or her, then you shouldn't turn away the rumors by listing all the reasons you would never date your friend. That would be mean-spirited and could destroy your friendship. Tread with care.
 It doesn't really hurt to think of the topic because maybe he or she is the right one.
 Your friend will eventually hear what you said eventually and all trust will be broken, unless you have discussed this earlier.
