heat up the stove by building a nice fire in it with the damper(s) wide open.

@summary

@summary
as you heat up the stove, put a kettle or pot of water on to heat as well.

@summary
test the top of the stove by tossing a drop of water on it.

@summary
vary your technique depending on what you're cooking:

@summary
to make soup, put on a pot, let it heat up well (keep the stove hot, adding wood as necessary and opening/closing the damper to try to maintain a temperature), fry whatever you want fried (meat, onion, etc) and add some boiling water or soup stock.

@summary
when done cooking, turn the dampers down and let the stove cool a bit, but keep that pan of water on there.

,, You'll need it for soup, stew, tea, coffee, dish washing...everything. It also serves as a heat-storage measure so use a big kettle. A canner works well.
 If the water sizzles and danced, the stove is pretty much ready.
 If you add cold water it will take forever to heat up again...that pan of hot water is crucial.






To "bake" something, put it in a pan (cake, bread) or in foil (potatoes) and if the top of the stove is very hot put foil items on a trivet or a bit of crumpled foil. Then cover with a larger pan that goes all the way down to the stovetop. Big metal bowls also work for this sort of make-shift oven.






You can use the fire-box of the stove as a sort of broiler or tandoori oven. Wrap whatever you want to cook in heavy foil and put in the coals after things have cooled down a bit (warning...you may turn your food into charcoal).






To fry on the stovetop, use a thin thin pan. Cast iron pans on a cast iron stove take forever to heat up so might work for soups and stews left all day, but not great for frying. If you don't have a thin frying pan or saucepan to use, back to the heavy-duty foil! (a coffee can will work too!). Set the pan on the stove, oil it up well. Test for hotness with a drop of water and fry away.
 You never know when you'll want a cup of tea.
