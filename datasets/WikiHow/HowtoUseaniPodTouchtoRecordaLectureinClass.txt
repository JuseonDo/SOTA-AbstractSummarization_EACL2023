There are certain earbuds sold by Applethat have a remote and mic on them.
If you have a 4th generation iPod touch or above, there is a built-in microphone, so you don't need any accessories.
If you have an older iPod touch (1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation), there is no microphone, so you'll need the earbuds or other external mic.

To save battery, you can lock the device. As long as you don't pause it, it will continue to record.
 Make sure to do this discreetlyâ€”try waiting until the teacher is out of the room or otherwise occupied.
