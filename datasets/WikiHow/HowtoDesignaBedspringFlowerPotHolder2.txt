 If you plan to add paint or glaze to the bedspring and/or flower pot, your first step should be to add your glaze or paint. Allow for ample dry time so you don’t compromise your design when assembling the flower pot.
, Work quickly as you don’t want the glue to dry before you add the flower pot.
 Position the flower pot inside the bedspring and allow the glue to dry and adhere to the pot.


The bedspring may bend slightly with the weight of the flower pot. The bending may give your design more of a distinctive appeal.
 Add water when ready and place pot in the sun.
