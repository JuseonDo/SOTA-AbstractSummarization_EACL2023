 You will need 1 large box and a file box to put the files in. If you have many piles, start with the smallest.;
, Mark boxes, TRASH, and FILE and begin sorting just on these two categories.
 Put the bill in the file folder and label the tab Unpaid Bills and set it in the file box.
 These could be anything you think is important to keep: birthday cards, car information, checking account, dental, home loan information, home maintenance, insurance, medical, unpaid bills, utilities, etc.


The best place to file something is where it is most obvious to you. Put things where you think they should go and it will be easiest for you to find them later.
, Either file it or throw it out.
 After you file your papers you might want to make files within files that are close to the same subject. For example, you could divide car information into car insurance, recalls/warranties, repairs,and copies of titles and registrations. This way you have all the info when you need it.
 When you get your mail out of your mailbox, go through right away and toss the junk. When you get into the house, make it a point to place it near your file cabinet. Choose a specific time that fits your schedule to open your mail and sort it on a daily basis. You could put unpaid bills in a folder in the front of the file box to help you to remember to pay them. File the important things and toss the rest in the trash can located next to your file cabinet.
 Does a particular piece of paper require action or attendance at a later date? Write it in your calendar, then file the paper. You can even write where you filed the paper.
