 Mainly because you are the coach. So, look at all your plays (but don't take too much time) and see which one is best for the situation. Since it is NFL Blitz, there is some unrealistic factor, but that also means you can jump five feet high and catch the ball. So think.;
, If you have a PlayStation 2, then to juke is L2, Turbo is R2, and hurdling people is X. And use your turbo wisely. If you are receiving the kick, and you are about to get tackled, and you have a clear path for a touchdown, use turbo to get by.
, And never give up.
