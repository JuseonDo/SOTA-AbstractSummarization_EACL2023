 Junpei had a tenancy to try to make it with girls, but that would take a long time. So for now, you'll have to settle for something like a pornographic magazine or film. But don't let anyone but your closest friends know.;
, If someone is looking for players, don't waist time, sign up. If there isn't anyone forming a baseball team, try starting your own team. You may not be good at this sport at first, but keep at it. It pays to practice.
 If the scene looks grim, trying making up a corny joke to lighten the mood. Or tell a rumor or ghost story. Although it may not be funny or scary, you did your best. And don't forget to smile.
 If you played the game, you know what Junpei's victory pose is. Give it a try. If you don't like it, come up with your own.
 If someone you know is going through some tough times, try to talk to them. Sometimes you'll say the right thing, sometimes you'll say the wrong things. But don't give up on this person.
 Junpei had Chidori. Do you know any girls you might have a crush on. Go for them even if you know they don't want to be with you or if you know it will not end good.
