@summary
even before throwing (which is the term used when making a pot on the wheel) you need to make yourself comfortable.

@summary
slam a round ball of clay as close to the center of the wheel as possible.

@summary
start the wheel and allow it to spin slowly.

@summary
place your hands on the cone only after the wheel is going at a medium pace.

@summary
while pressing down with the thumb into the center of the piece, use your other hand to guide your thumb into the piece.

@summary
once a hole is established use both of your hands to widen the gap.

@summary
squeeze the walls up by placing your index finger of your left hand on the inside while your right index finger is on the outside.

@summary
repeat pulling until the walls of the cylinder are thick enough for you, which is about a quarter of an inch thick.

@summary
cup a moderately wet sponge around the top edge of the piece and apply slight pressure to make the edge rounded and more appealing.

@summary

@summary
slowly slide a wire underneath your piece while the wheel is moving at a slow pace.
@article
 Sit with your legs spread wide so that you can rest your elbows on the inside of your thighs. This is to allow more pressure to come from your entire body onto the piece rather than just your hands.;
, This serves two purposes, one so that the clay will stick well to the wheel and also to eliminate air bubbles that are in the clay.
 As the wheel is turning dampen your hands and get the ball wet as well. Then start patting the ball into a cone shame until it is no longer wobbling.
 Again force the clay into the center of the wheel. If you are right handed your left elbow should dig into your left thigh. Your entire body is used to center the piece.
 Press your arms into your side to keep your arms from moving. Leave enough clay on the bottom of the piece so that you will be able to have a bottom.
 When water builds up on the bottom of the cylinder use a dry sponge to soak up the excess water.
 This is called pulling, be careful not to puncture the clay, however apply enough force so that clay is being forced upwards. How fast you pull up on the piece is affected by how fast the wheel is moving. Therefore the quicker the wheel is spinning the faster you can finish a piece. It is better to not go fast when you are first starting out, once you feel more comfortable with the motions you will be able to go faster.
 If there is a large amount of clay around the base of the piece then trim the base of the piece with a wooden tool that is cut at a 45 degree angle.
, Careful not to go through the bottom of your piece. Make sure that the wire hugs the wheel tightly.
