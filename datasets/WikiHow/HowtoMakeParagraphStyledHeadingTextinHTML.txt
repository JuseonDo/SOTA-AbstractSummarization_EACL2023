Recognize that these tags work well, when they are partnered with regular text without much formatting. Although they aren't centered by default, with a little work they can be, but they form a backbone that symbolizes something looking like a title to a paragraph or other text in the HTML page.
Realize that these tags have certain levels of headings that can be formed ranging from <h1> to <h6> although the h1 level and potentially h2 level should be all that you should really need in the long run.
Recognize that as the number gets larger, the text size will get smaller, but will start out pretty big.
Recognize that these tags already are shown in boldface, so there should be no reason to have to manually boldface them. However, these tags are also deprecated in the current version of HTML, so they are not widely used anymore.
 With nearly 10 "h" levels, there are nearly endless choices on how many levels down you'll need to cast your heading into the document. An example would be <h1> for a top-level heading/header.
, In this earlier case, it's the <h1> tag, which has an accompanying </h1> end-tag.
 Explain your heading.
