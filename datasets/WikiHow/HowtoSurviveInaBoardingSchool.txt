 A boarding school in a poor country can be good. Try to look at the school's facilities. You may also ask for a taster weekend in the boarding house.;
, You will need them eventually. Remember you cannot go back home everyday so always bring more than enough.
 If you don't have any friends, you will have a rough school life. Living with people 24/7 is very different than just go to normal school. You will know about their personalities and you may not like all of their qualities but you must learn to accept. Nobody is perfect. If you are stubborn, you will have a bad image and others won't want to interact with you.
 Bathe every day and you may want to use deodorant. Nobody wants to share a room with someone that stinks.
 Usually schools put students of different nationalities together. You may want to know more about their culture and respect them.
 Having a bad relationship with a teacher while boarding is not good. Follow the rules even though you may think they are sometimes ridiculous, but it is to ensure you have a safe and disciplined life.
 If there is a bully in the school, tell a friend. If you can, tell one with muscles. If that fails, just tell a teacher. Boarding schools are usually good and teachers will actually bother to help you.
 But remember - it's QUALITY and not QUANTITY of friends that matters.
 This is very important or you will have a very dull life while you spend your time there. You may want to join more activities for boarders and integrate with them. It may be hard in the beginning, but when you have a few friends, you will get the happy atmosphere and eventually win more friends.
 Its easy to lose track of things you have to do without a parent around, so having extra time put aside specifically for your academic needs is very useful.
