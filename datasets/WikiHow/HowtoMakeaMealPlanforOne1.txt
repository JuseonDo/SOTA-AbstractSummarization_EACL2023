, Chances are you are too tired to even think about cooking, let alone shopping for food!
What days are you home a little earlier, or maybe working from home? Consider cooking extra on these days. For example: have a rice dish on Tuesday and a fried rice dish on Thursday, made with the leftover rice.
,
Tuesday: chicken curry with rice.

Wednesday: mashed potatoes, peas and a pork chop.
Thursday: fried rice with vegetables and fish.
Friday: soup and a sandwich.
Saturday: dinner date (yes, you can still eat out if you want!)

Sunday: treat yourself to a three course meal.
