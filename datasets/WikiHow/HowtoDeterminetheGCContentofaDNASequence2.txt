@summary
create or accept an input file.

@summary
read in the file.

@summary
create a counter.

@summary
divide the gc count by the total length of the sequence, and output the result in percentage format.
@article
 This article assumes that the input is in FASTA format, with a single sequence per file., For FASTA format:

Discard the first line of the file.
Remove all remaining newlines and other trailing whitespace.





def init(sequence):
    with open(argv) as input:
        sequence = "".join(])
    return sequence




, Iterate through the data and increment your counter as you encounter any guanine or cytosine nucleotides.




def GCcontent(sequence):
    GCcount = 0
    for letter in sequence:
        if letter == "G" or letter == "C":
            GCcount += 1
    return GCcount




,




def main():
    script, input = argv
    sequence = ""
    sequence = init(sequence)
    print "%.2f" % (float(GCcontent(sequence)) / len(sequence))
