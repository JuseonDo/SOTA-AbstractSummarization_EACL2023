 Your boiler's owner's manual may also have instructions for zone valve wiring. Look for any diagrams to help you connect valve wiring in the system's control box.


If you do not have your particular zoning system's instruction manual, try looking for it online through the manufacturer's website.;
, Depending on your system, this may involve flipping an electrical switch or shutting off circuit breakers located ahead and at the boiler.
 This box or panel should be located on a wall near your boiler.
 It may have terminals marked "T" in it that go to the boiler to control when to send the boiler's heated water. The control box should also have a transformer of a certain voltage, perhaps 24 volts, to carry power between the thermostat and zone valves.


Zone valve manufacturers often label the connection terminals in their control boxes to make it easier to wire their systems. Use these labels to help you make the appropriate wiring connections.
 Connect the other side of the thermostat to the first terminal of the zone valve operator.
,, This configuration should wire 3 zone valves.
 The number of zone valves that a control box can handle depends on the model. It may range from 2 or 3 zones to 6.


To wire additional zones, 1 or more extra transformers may be required as well.
 Try matching up wires from labeled terminals in the control box to matching terminals for the transformer(s).
