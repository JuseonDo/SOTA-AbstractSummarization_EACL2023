,,,,, Now, you might have limited contacts in your email ID or in a file say 500. But, this is not a sufficient amount, if you send invitation to 500 people then only 1-2 will join your group. Do not worry, from here the trick begins.


There are few programs that can produce email IDs using common names on of the people of the countries you want to target. Type 'Email IDs production engine' in Google to find it out.
 Soon, you will be having thousands of email IDs for the country you want to target. Export these email IDs in a text file.
 Select the file in which you have saved email IDs. Write a good and attractive message.


Using this feature Facebook can send email to all the members at once, whether it is 1000, 10000 or 50000.
 Ultimately these members will be visiting to your website you have mentioned in the group or in the post that you can make your group.
