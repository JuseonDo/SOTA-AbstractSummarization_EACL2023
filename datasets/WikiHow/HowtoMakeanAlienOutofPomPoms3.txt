finished.

@article
, Wind it up until it's all curled around the cone. Remove carefully, keeping the pipe cleaner spring intact. One end should be narrow, the other wide.


You can also wind the pipe cleaner around a pencil or pen. This will achieve an all-one-size spring, so it will probably need to be shorter to ensure stability.
 Adjust to ensure it's not wobbling.
 Add further decorative elements if liked, otherwise, the alien is good to go.


Other things you might add include arms, feet, buttons, ray guns, rations in a bag, etc.
