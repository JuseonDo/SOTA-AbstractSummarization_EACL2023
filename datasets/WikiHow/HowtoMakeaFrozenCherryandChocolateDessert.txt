 Throw out the bad cherries, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put back into the freezer.;
, Make sure it is baking chocolate, and not a chocolate bar or chocolate chips. Milk chocolate is recommended, although any type of chocolate works.
 50% power is very important, because it won't burn the chocolate.
 This should only take a few seconds.
 Peel off the plastic wrap, then pour the melted chocolate all over the cherries. Scrape out the remainder with a spoon. The chocolate will take a few seconds to solidify over the cherries.
 Eat the chocolate cherry dessert!
