, In the General tab, you will find a few options. The most important one is the Back up catalog option. Choose the one that will work for you. Depending on how much you have in the catalog, it could take no time at all or a long time. Still, backing up is a good idea.


A good heuristic is that, if you are a casual user, set it for backing up at about a week.



In the Preview section, make the changes you want. Be sure to keep in mind that the more there is in its cache, the slower things can get.
In the File Handling section, decide on the preview size that you want.
