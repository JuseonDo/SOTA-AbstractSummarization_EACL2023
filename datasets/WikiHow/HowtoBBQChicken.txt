;
, In a large pot, dissolve 1/4 of a cup of kosher salt in about one quart of hot water. Flavorings like peppercorns, lemon peel, honey, rosemary or other spices can also be added. Adding a little sugar to the brine helps the outside of the chicken to caramelize.










Remove chicken from brine and pat with paper towels
If possible, allow pieces to dry on racks for a couple of hours. This produces the crispiest skin possible.
 A mixture of vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and molasses is a great alternative to a commercially-prepared sauce. 







, Allow fluid to soak in for 15 minutes, then toss in lit matches at every corner of the pyramid.
, You want a minimal amount of heat on one side and a fierce blaze on the other. 







, Cover grill and allow to cook for 25-35 minutes, until chicken is golden-brown and 150 F at the bone. 







,, In small batches, move chicken over the coals on the other side of the grill.
 Remove quickly, after about three to five minutes. 








If the skin becomes black and charred before the meat is done, the coals are too high. Use the grill scraper to distribute coals underneath the rack more evenly.
If the skin is flabby and the meat isn't cooking through, the coals are too low. Stoke them with a scraper to get the heat up, or throw in a few more quick-light coals.
