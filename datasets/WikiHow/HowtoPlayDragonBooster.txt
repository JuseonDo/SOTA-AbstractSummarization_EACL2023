 Although Free Run is an option, you won't be able to race on any tracks because you have to start the All City Races. When you do, you have a choice to go to the Gear Shop, (Top Left Corner) where you need Dracles. (Dragon Booster Currency)


The gear shop guy, known by other names, can tell you what the gear does if you press L.;
, All dragons use three draconium colors (Gold uses 4 colors). They all include gray, because gray is all of the thirteen Draconium Colors.


You can view the dragon and rider from different angles by pressing L or R.
, You exit out, but not to the main screen, to the file screen.
 If you click on your file again, there is a password choice in the bottom left corner of the lower screen. Enter your cheats here.


Grudge matches are where you play against other people.
Mini challenge, as the name suggests, you play a mini challenge against the ai.



Skills competition is where you have to mag the red targets and the green targets for bonus points. Green is better than red. Avoid blue, as that is the enemy's target.
Dragon-Human duel is where you have to use the gear along the path in order to take down the rider. You could also keep to the wall, that is, keep them to the outside of the path so they crash into the walls holding the gear.

Alternatively, touch the letters at the bottom of the lower screen.
, It should become red and a gauge, called the sprint meter to go down. In the top right corner you will go faster than usual. To make the sprint meter recharge, or go up, touch the stylus onto the arrows and slide. Sliding two times in the red mode will take you to blue mode, where you will see the sprint meter go up.
,, This button will show you the race route or map. It will show where you are on the route.
