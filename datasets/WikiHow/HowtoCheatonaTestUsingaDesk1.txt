This method only works if you sit at a desk that has a liftable top.
If you don't have this type of desk, you can try using your backpack in the same manner.
 But in reality, you're actually looking at your notes.


Make sure to remove something from your desk each time you up the desktop. Otherwise you will look really suspicious. Be prepared by stocking your desk (or backpack) with extra pens, pencils, erasers etc.
Bring a flashlight if necessary.
