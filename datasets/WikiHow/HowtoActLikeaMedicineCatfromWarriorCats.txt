 To be a medicine cat you will need knowledge on herbs and how they work. You will also need a pretty strong connection with Starclan.;
, Stick to the warrior code, and make up prophecies to tell to friends and have people fulfill.
 You have to know ALL of them, even the poisons that can kill you and the ones not used for cats or not generally used frequently. The main herbs are feverfew, for fever; marigold, for infection; poppy seeds for pain; catmint, for greencough; tansy, for coughs; and cobwebs, for bleeding.
,, Be sure you don't lose them. Stow them in a box outside. When you are out in the yard and it's not raining, open it to let the air come in.
 You can still hang out with friends though, because even medicine cats have fun once in a while.
 Be as busy as you can, and rush around the house often searching for a "certain herb that looks like parsley."

, You have to do lots of things being a medicine cat, and those are supposed to take up the bored time you have and make your life busier.
 Being a medicine cat, you will have to set a time each month, if possible at night, to go to a certain pond, maybe lake, or a puddle, and if you aren't able to do that, a set place. Another idea is to make a Moonstone, which would be easier to find.
 Find someone interested in herbs, and let them be trained by you.
,, You can use catspeak, but don't fight or seem a bit too close to it, because medicine cats never fight unless they have to (which means only if they are fighting a badger or fox).
