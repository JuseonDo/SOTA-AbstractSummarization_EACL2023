 See if you want to add images. A nice picture of cartoon best friends drawn by yourself, or a photo of you both adds a nice touch to your message.


You can also include decorations. Decorate your card elegantly, but do not put on so many things that it looks like clutter.
 If your friend lives far away, this might be a good option.


Alternatively, you can put it in an envelope, and give it to your friend if you are scheduled to meet.
 This option is faster, and saves paper.


You can write the message directly into the email, or you can make an image with the message. Basic programs like MS Paint work well for this.
 Make sure that your message is free of errors and insincere words.
