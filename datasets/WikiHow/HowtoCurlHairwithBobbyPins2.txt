, It's best if you don't leave it to dry completely; rather, keep it a bit damp to make it easier to work with and to increase the curl.


You can use a hair dryer if you'd like; just don't get your hair bone dry.
,, Use a minimum of four bobby pins to pin it over, in place.
, Be generous with the coverage, as it'll help to set the curls.
 Remove the bobby pins the following morning. You should find that you will have lovely curls.
