 Lowercase Gothic script is done at five pen widths, ascenders and descenders use an additional two pen widths and uppercase letters are done at six pen widths.
 This means that if your pen's nib is 3 millimeters wide, you'll need a line 15 millimeters wide for the lowercase letters. In the picture the lines are ruled in pen to make them show more clearly, but it is usually done in pencil to erase them later.
,,, Familiarize yourself with the form of the letters and then make the letter on your ruled lines.
 At first your letters are going to look shaky and silly, but it will improve if you are dedicated to your new hobby.
