@summary

, Make sure that the strips are about 1/3” (8 millimeters) apart, and don’t cut into the pith of the fruit. What you’re aiming for is to slice away the colored part of the skin that contains the essential oils, without taking away any of the bitterness of the white part of the rind.
 Your finished product will look like a rolled jellyroll cake.
 Your knife should go into the peel parallel to the outside of the roll, not perpendicular to the roll.
 Make sure that one end rests inside the drink to impart some essential oils into the drink. Alternatively, you can gently drop the rind into the drink and let it float on the surface.
