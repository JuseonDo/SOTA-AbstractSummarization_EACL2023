 You will need six poles, about six or seven feet tall, with sturdy bases. Set the first one in the middle of the arena, about six yards from the fence/wall. You can also use cones, barrels, etc., though it is best to use actual western equipment if you plan on teaching this and performing at shows (that way your horse knows the set up best).;
, You should be able to take about 7 steps (on foot, not horseback) between each pole. If you're less than about 4 and 1/2 feet tall, it's more like 11 steps. Make sure they are in line with each other.
 Especially if you and your horse are new to this, it is important to get the horse moving and get you in rhythm. Warm up by walking, trotting, and loping your horse around in circles.
 You will find that often it has loosened itself up after your warm up, and your horse is more relaxed. Make sure that you can slide two fingers under your cinch; if it is not tight enough there is a large chance that you will not be able to stay on as easily.
 When you go around the poles, you should stay about four feet away. Remember to start on your horse's best lead (if you are unsure what this is talk to a professional for help). Don't forget to use your leg cues, too! As you are going around the pole, use your other leg to switch the lead your horse is on.
 Take him around the ring once or twice.
 When the pole is next to your leg, ask for a turn (your horse is moving so fast that, by the time he gets the signal, it will be time to turn).
