The butter must be softened. If the butter is still chilled, it will be impossible to mix the garlic in evenly.
To soften butter, leave it out on the kitchen counter for about 30 minutes. If you are short on time, microwave the butter, in its paper wrapping, for about 10 seconds. Do not microwave foil wrapping.
If you do not have fresh garlic or do not want pieces of minced garlic mixed into your asparagus dish, you could use 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) of garlic powder, instead.
 Place roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of garlic butter on the hot, microwaved asparagus, tossing the spears gently to melt the butter and coat the asparagus.


If you want to flavor the asparagus as it cooks, use the tender-cook method outlined above and add the 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of garlic butter to the asparagus when you add the salt, just before you cover and cook it.
The rest of the butter can be stored and refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 days.
