, Once the butter is melted, add the chopped celery, carrots, and onion. Stir to coat the vegetables evenly with the butter. Simmer the vegetables in the butter for about 8 minutes, or until they begin to soften.
 Heat the flour/butter mixture for 2 minutes to create a roux.
, Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring often.
