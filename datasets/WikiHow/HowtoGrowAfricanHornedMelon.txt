 Choose an area with FULL sunlight {Greenhouse cultivation is a must in colder climates} with an area for the plant to vine such as a trellis or fence as the vine can reach up to 5 feet (1.5 m).;
, Kiwano prefers loamy or 40%-40%-20% Sand-Silt-Clay mixture, and a Ph range of 6.0 - 6.5. **If using a container, make sure it is well drained.
 Push the seed 1/2" into prepared soil or twice the size of the root-ball if planting a seedling. You'll want to allow about 6 feet (1.8 m) between rows and about 2 feet (0.6 m) between groupings of 2-3 seeds {1 seedling}. **If using a container, allow for 4–5 gallons (15.1–18.9 L) of soil per plant.
 Germination varies and can occur between 5 days and two weeks depending on your climate. As the plant matures, you will need to provide 1-2" of water per week. You should also be sure to let the soil dry out a bit between watering, making this a great plant for forgetful gardeners in the tropics!
