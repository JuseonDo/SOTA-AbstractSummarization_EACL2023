Although azuki beans cook faster than other beans, sometimes you'll need to cook the beans slightly longer than an hour.
 Do this in batches because there will be too many beans to do all at once.


This is where personal preference will affect how finely you strain the beans. Some people prefer a completely smooth paste, devoid of bean skin, while others don't mind a little bit of chunkiness. The choice is yours, but either way is delicious!
Some people puree the bean paste in a blender for added smoothness. Afterward, they pass the mixture through cheesecloth to remove the fine fragments of bean skin.
 Make sure to constantly stir so the beans don't stick to the pan. You may need to add water occasionally if you find the beans are getting too dry.
 Cook for 10 minutes and remove from pan. Store in a container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to a week.
