 Focus on the third island. (its best if you've got this far in the game.);
, Mark your target here.
 When possible, try to get a "freeway" motorbike on the way to the restricted area as you will need one to get in (you can find one in Fort Carson).
, Turn to your right and drive briefly down the fence line to where there's an open entry with a small track leading into the restricted area.
 Park next to it so that the side you get off is the vent (you may have to position the bike a few times in order for this to work). Press triangle and you should end up in a room with a mini gun. From there you are free to explore the underground compound.
 Walk down the steps and turn left. Go up some more steps and you should be in a room with one red door/gate in front of you and one to the side. Walk in and turn to your left. You should see two fenced off openings, turn once again to your left and face the vent, look carefully for it as it's easy to miss. Shoot the black slits covering it and jump in.
(You may need to position CJ differently a few times so that this can work)
