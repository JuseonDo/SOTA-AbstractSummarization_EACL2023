 You will need a hacked PSP running custom firmware in order to use this method. Any version of the PSP or PSP Go can be hacked., These programs can translate YouTube videos into a format that can be streamed to your PSP, since it can’t normally play Flash files. Two of the more popular programs are GoTube and PSPTube., Go to the Settings menu in the XMB and select “USB Connection”. Copy the homebrew program’s folder into your PSP’s GAME folder., This will disconnect it from the computer, and you can remove the cable., Navigate to the Game menu in your XMB. Scroll until you find the YouTube program that you installed. Press the X button to open the program., The navigation varies depending on the program you chose. These programs will not always be able to translate videos. This is especially true for newer HD videos on YouTube.
