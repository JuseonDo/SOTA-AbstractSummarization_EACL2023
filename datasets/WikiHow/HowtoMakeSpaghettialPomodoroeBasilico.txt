 Use only the highest quality and freshest ingredients for best results.;
, Start a pot of water boiling and follow the instructions from the Make Spaghetti page for spaghetti or linguine.
, Do not burn the garlic however as it will leave an acrid taste. The garlic should ideally just be golden brown. Turn the heat off and discard the garlic.
, A good estimate is half a can of water for each can of tomatoes or for each three tomatoes.
, Add the fresh uncooked basil and add grated pecorino and Parmesan cheese (half and half).
, This dish is delicious with salad or garlic bread to compliment its fresh flavours.
