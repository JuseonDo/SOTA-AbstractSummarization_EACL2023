@summary
reset the new part exactly as the old one had been (for ordering, check the link below) make sure that all wire connections go back exactly as they had been.

once the ipod parts are all together, replace the faceplate on the back plate exactly as it had been and squeeze it back together until it clicks.

 Take some time and figure out if the problem is the hard drive, LCD screen, logic board, or otherwise. Make sure you get the right part because typically iPod parts, even aftermarket models, are fairly expensive. You can always test to see what hardware is bad by grabbing one of your friends' iPods and playing trial-and-error with parts.;
, This is easily done, thankfully. At least this is the case with video iPods and comparable models(lacquer face and aluminum back plate). Take a small flathead screwdriver(like an eyeglasses style one) and insert it on either the left or right side into the groove where the black/white faceplate meets the aluminum back plate(on other iPod models, where the aluminum meets the plastic). Then push the flathead in and down. This will release the clips(there are 3 on each side) that hold the back plate onto the faceplate.
 This will release tension on the battery and headphone jack cables, which I might add, are extremely delicate.
 Sometimes parts don't come with absolutely everything needed to remount. An example is the headphone jack which also includes the hold switch. That main white mounting unit isn't included with a replacement so you'll need to keep that.
