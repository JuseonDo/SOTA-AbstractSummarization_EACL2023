 If they say yes, decide on a day when you want to do that together.


Weekends are often best if your mum gets up early on other days.;
, Fill it out with a message of love ahead of time.
 These are eggs, salt, pepper, toast, butter, and coffee.


You might like to find a flower or a rose from the garden to decorate the tray with later.
 Line it with a clean tea towel or napkin, spread out. This will help it to look pretty and ensures a clean surface. Place the flower in a vase and put it on the tray.
 Wash your hands ahead of cooking.
 If you have a coffee maker, put the filter and coffee powder in (one scoop per cup of coffee) the top and enough water in the water compartment. Turn the coffee maker on and wait for the coffee to be ready.
, Depending on what your mum prefers, you could either boil the eggs, make scrambled eggs, or cook sunny-side-up eggs. Season the eggs with salt and pepper, or let her do this by placing the salt and pepper containers on the tray.
 Place everything on a tray to carry to your mum in bed.
 Tell her you have a surprise for her and produce the breakfast-in-bed tray of goodies.
