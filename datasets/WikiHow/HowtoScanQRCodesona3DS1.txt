 You'll need internet access to use your QR scanner. Check your specific QR code and make sure that it should be played by the 3DS. Unless it says it is for a specific game, your DS should recognize it., L and R are the two top "shoulder" buttons. Hold them simultaneously for two to three seconds to pull up the camera

, It will look like a little checkerboard button on the left side of your screen. This should bring up the QR scanner, which will give you specific instructions on scanning the code.
 Common problems include not centering the code in the camera, too little light, or being too close or far from the code. Make sure the image is flattened and adjust the 3DS slowly until it scans in.


If the code is meant for a specific game, you'll likely get a message telling you so. However, you could also just get an error message.
