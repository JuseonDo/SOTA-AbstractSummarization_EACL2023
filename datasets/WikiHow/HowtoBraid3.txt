 Whether you're using ribbon, string, or another long, thin material, start with three pieces that are all the same.
 Use a knot to tie the pieces together about 1/2" from the ends. You can double knot the pieces to make sure they're secure.
 Use a piece of masking tape to tape the ends above the knot to a board or other hard surface, to keep the pieces anchored while you braid.
 One is the left piece, one is the middle piece, and one is the right piece.
 Now the formerly left piece is in the middle. Continue holding all three pieces taut.
 This completes the first section of the braid.
 Alternate crossing the left over the middle, then the right over the middle, making sure the strings stay taut. Continue weaving the strings in this way until you've run out of string to weave.
 Gather the three ends and make another knot to secure them.
