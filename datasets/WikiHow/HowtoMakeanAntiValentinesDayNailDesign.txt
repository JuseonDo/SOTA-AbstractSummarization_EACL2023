 This will give you easy access to everything, so that you can avoid messing up your nails in the process of taking something out.
 Some people skip this step, but it’s nice to have them clean and filed for a more polished look.
 The base coat helps to prevent staining and peeling on your nails. The color will also stick onto the base coat if you use one.
, Some polishes have different formulas, so it depends on how many coats will get it opaque. You could also start out using the red, black, or pink nail polish, and make the heart one of those colors. This design is not limited to these colors; you can use other schemes with this design. Just be creative with it.
 You want the polish to be dry so that you can make the next part of your design without it smearing and/or mixing the two colors together, making you ruin your nail art design.
 Any kind of paper will do, preferably a piece of scrap paper.
 Dip your dotting tool into the red polish and drag it down in the middle of your nail. Do the same to the other side. If you don’t have a dotting tool, you can use a bobby pin, the end of a needle pin, or the end of a pencil for the heart(s). There are a lot of household items that you can use if you don't have the dotting tool.
 This depends on how big or small you prefer the heart to be.
, If you have these colors in nail art stripers that will also work as well. If using the nail stripers, you don't have to place the dots of polish on the paper towel.
 Create an “X” on the heart. Make sure the lines are thin so that the heart is still visible. If you make the lines too thick, you won't get to see the heart as well.
 Take off the excess polish by wiping it on the edge of the bottle. To make sure that the line is thin, practice making some lines onto the paper towel. Once you’re satisfied, create the “X” on the heart.
