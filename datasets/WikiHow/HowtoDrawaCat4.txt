 Sketch a circle for the head and add two crossed lines at the center. Use a much bigger circle for the body and a curved line attached to it on the back.
 Make the cheeks appear plumped and the ears pointy and protruding on each side of the head.
 This will be your guide in drawing the nose and the mouth. Draw another pair of two small oblongs at the bottom of the body’s outline and add a long rectangle shape on one side.
 Make the eyes almond shaped, draw the nose and in framing the face, draw small strokes to make the cat appear furry. 

,, Remember to use small strokes to make it appear furry.
