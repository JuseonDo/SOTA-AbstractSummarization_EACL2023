 Remove the label. Place the unopened can on its side on the bottom of the slow cooker. Fill the slow cooker with enough water to fully immerse the can and cover it with an extra two inches (five cm) of water.

 Use tongs or a slotted spoon. Allow the can to cool on a wire rack to room temperature before opening.
