 Make sure the ascot is on the inside of your collar directly touching your skin. The two open ends should be resting on your chest.


Some ascots come with a pre-sewn loop on one side. If you are using an ascot with a loop, simply thread the long end of the ascot through the loop and skip to Step 4.






If you are wearing a button-up shirt, you will need to unbutton at least the top button.

,, If you want a tighter, more secure knot, wrap the long end around the short end a second time., Be sure not to make the folds too tight.
, The ascot should be positioned straight in the center of your chest just like a normal tie.


The two ends should now be about the same length.






If you are using an ascot with a pre-sewn loop, your ascot will only have one tail down your chest.
 Use your fingers to straighten and smooth the fold that you created at the base of your neck.


Add a safety pin or decorative pin to the middle of the knot in the ascot if you want the knot to be extra secure.
 If you are not wearing a waistcoat, you should tuck the ascot into whatever V-shaped neck of clothing you are wearing on your torso, such as a blazer. The focus of an ascot is the bib that forms around the neck, so just make sure that this part is exposed.
