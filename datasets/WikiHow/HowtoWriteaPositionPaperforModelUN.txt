 For example: "Fellow delegates, I will introduce myself as the delegate of Finland". If you don't like to be very formal, talk about your country's advantages. For example: "Finland is a nation in Northern Europe that has a great health care system.";
, For example: "For the Maldives, global warming has always been a top priority, over the years, the sea levels have been rising, putting my delegation in risk of sinking."

, For example: "Recently, Bangladesh has begun to experience an increase in floods and has observed and recorded higher sea levels too."

, Remember that you should make solutions that involve everyone and benefit everyone, as much as possible. If you do so, more people will consider you as the committee's leader.


For example: "Introducing new alternative energies will help to reduce emissions, slowing the release of emissions that contribute to global warming and helping to prevent the continued melting of glaciers and sea-level rise being experienced around the world. It will also support the American economies that are trying to make businesses from alternate energy production. If these services are also established in Africa, there would be increased work opportunities and better economic outcomes."

, Finish with how your country's resolutions can go a long way to solving the problem. There is no example, it is all up to you.
 Demonstrate how could they be avoided with your country's solutions.
 Also try to mention as many statistics as possible, as it will make you sound more professional and reflects that you have done your homework.
 In this case, try to mention what cures have eventuated from collaborative research efforts and which research/medical organizations are the most helpful and why.
 Analyze your nation's priorities––people?; money?; weapons?; territory? After analyzing it, try to apply it in a friendly way to your position paper.
