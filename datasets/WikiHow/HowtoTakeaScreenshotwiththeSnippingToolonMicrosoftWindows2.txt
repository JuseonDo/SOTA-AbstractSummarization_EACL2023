 Windows 10’s Snipping Tool has a new feature, called “Time Delay.” When you take a traditional snip, you don’t have any time to “set up” the shot, making it impossible to capture a screenshot of anything that requires a click from your mouse to open. The time delay feature gives you 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 seconds to move your mouse and click a feature, such as a drop-down menu, before the snip is captured.
,,, Options include: "Free-form snip", "Rectangular snip", "Window snip", or "Full-screen snip".
 Normally when you select this an overlay instantly appears on your screen. However if you've selected a time delay the overlay will appear after 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 seconds. When the delay is done, your overlay will appear, effectively freezing your screen and allowing you to take the screenshot you desire.
 Click down on your cursor and hold as you draw free-form around the object you want to capture.
