 Turn the key to "on" without starting the care and listen for a "whirring" noise to occur. It should last for about two seconds and should be coming from the rear of the vehicle as the pump is in the gas tank.
 The relay is in the inner passenger side fuse box. Turn the key to "on" without starting the care and listen for a click coming from the relay.,, Peel back the carpeting in the trunk on the driver side paneling behind the wheel well. There is a connector there with three wires: green, black, and grey. Use a multi-meter to probe the hot grey wire and touch a ground. Turn the car to "on" and you should see 12V for 2 seconds., Test for continuity between the ground contact on the fuel module and another ground (bare metal) on the car., You may also have a dirty and blocked fuel filter.
