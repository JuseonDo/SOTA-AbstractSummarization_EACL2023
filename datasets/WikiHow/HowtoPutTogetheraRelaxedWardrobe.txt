 Look for colors that suit you well but that fall within the relaxed range. Relaxed colors include beige, pastels, silver, deep blues and purples, greens and colors of the forest.;
, Silks, linen, tencel, cottons, wool and breathable fabrics are usually good clothes for relaxing in. Look for a nice flow and if you want comfort, elasticized waists or good fits.
 A fresh white t-shirt goes well with most color combinations. It's a good idea to own a few white t-shirts, so that you can stay relaxed and not spend all your time washing!


Other nice tops include baby doll, long flowing tops and transparent tops over a t-shirt or camisole.
 Tencel is an excellent fabric for comfort and neat style. Alternatively, choose white, beige or brown slacks in such fabrics as linen, Tencel or silk. Elasticized waists can be disguised with belts, scarves or over-length tops.


If you don't want to wear pants, choose long flowing skirts or dresses. Ones that feel luxurious and billow around your legs are lovely for relaxing.
, Choose a contrasting color from the t-shirt.
 These are very relaxed and are easy to kick off for lazing around. Ballet flats are a common favorite for a chic relaxed look but other flats like sandals, sneakers, loafers, espadrilles or other styles of flats can work too.
 Don't overdo it; choose pieces that aren't too complicated. A simple silver bangle, a plain gold necklace, diamante drop earrings, etc. are good relaxed additions.
 No tight, pulled back styles. Wear hair either down or loosely added to a messy bun or ponytail; or try scrunching your hair for a day of pretty hair that says relaxed.



If you're adding a hat, make sure it's in keeping with the other items. Don't wear hats that are too fancy; a simple straw hat or a beanie are relaxed choices.
Scarves, especially flowing silk or similar ones create a relaxed and comfortable look.
Sunglasses are good for keeping relaxed during bright days instead of squinting.
