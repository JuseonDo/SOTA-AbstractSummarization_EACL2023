 Keep your clan from dying by keeping a steady supply of food.;
, It's essential that everyone gets sleep. Keep your kits asleep too. They are going to be weak in the morning if they don't get any sleep.
 It's a good idea to keep your clan's apprentices to stay that rank until you know they are strong enough to take care of your clan.
 Ensure that some warriors switch with others who have already slept for a while.
 You don't want any coyotes stealing your kits. The queens will get upset and maybe leave your clan.
 You'll need someone to keep your clan running. Make sure your deputy is fit too.
 Be sure to take your clan on a run often. Always leave some of the clan behind to keep the camp safe (see above).
 Have them go hunt and spar with each other on a regular basis. It's good to keep strong and sharpen your skills in fighting.
 They'll turn out to be strong apprentices if you let them play fight with each other!

, They aren't the dullest knife in the drawer yet!

, However, given the possibility, make sure your warriors are strong at all times, and that there are enough of them.
 They shouldn't have major parts in battle, but they can do a bit to help your clan and train at the same time.
