 If you are using a convection oven, 425° (218° C) is acceptable.;
, Make sure to rinse the cavity, removing any gizzards or internal organs that may have come with packaging. Pat dry after washed.
 2 tablespoons of olive oil (or butter) should be enough for a 3 pound bird.
 If other fresh or dried herbs or spices are desired, include them in this step.
 The lemon will provide flavor, moisture, and aroma.
 Line the bottom of the roasting pan with enough aluminum foil to cover evenly for an easier cleanup.
 Tying the legs together will help them cook faster. (Typically, breast meat finishes cooking before leg and thigh meat, leaving the white meat dry once the dark meat is fully cooked.)

, Continue cooking for 40 more minutes, or until the internal temperature of the bird has reached 175° to 180° F.
 This will allow the juices to settle. Cutting immediately after removing from oven will cause the juices to run out, giving you a less moist chicken.
