 Also add the diced rhubarb. Heat gently and cook over medium for 10 minutes, or until the rhubarb softens without disintegrating. Stir now and then., Allow to cool briefly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425ÂºF., Mix to combine., If needed, cut the pre-made pastry to size. Fit into the individual pie dishes., Add half of the filling to each pie., Fold neatly but if it doesn't meet completely, that's fine; the pie dish will old it all together., Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the pie crust turns golden brown., Allow to cool on a wire cooling rack., The pie can be served warm or cool. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream or custard.
