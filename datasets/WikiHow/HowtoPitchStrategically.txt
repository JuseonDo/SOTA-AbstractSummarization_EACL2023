@summary
start off a lot of batters the first time around with a fastball low and away.

@summary
if they hit the first pitch, it will probably be a weak grounder.

@summary
if they hit that last one, it was probably a weak grounder, a solid grounder, or a pop-up.

@summary
after these three pitches early on, you can toy with the batter.

 This does several things. One, it shows the batter your speed. This may sound like a bad thing, but wait, it will help you.;
, If not, throw it again. Do not sit out here too long because eventually they will sit on it and destroy it.
 If not, throw a fastball as hard as you can inside and up. This gets the batter, who is leaning across the plate, to back off.
 Each subsequent at bat after the other team has batted around can be started with a change-up, curve, you name it. If the batter can catch up with your fastball, it will make your off-speed stuff and your curve ball even more effective.
