 Sometimes it's obvious, but sometimes it's pretty hard to determine. Also, make sure there actually is a problem, and your friend isn't just having a bad day or they are having a tough time outside of the friendship.;
, Talk to them about what they think you did wrong and it might turn out to be a big misunderstanding., Instead of bombarding them with questions and demands, let them cool down and think about the situation. Do this until however long it takes for your friend to stop glaring at you in the halls, insulting you, spreading rumors, crying, etc.
 There's the classic "talk to your friend and ask them what's wrong", the "ask a friend to ask your friend what's wrong", or even the "leave him/her alone until everyone forgets about it". Of course every situation is different, but talking to your friend directly is almost always the best option, even though it may be scary.
 It's better to remain modest instead of staying on your pedestal and playing innocent. Admitting all your faults will make that person feel better, and encourage them to do the same.
 Let your friend think about it.
 If your friend wants to cut the friendship for good, well, there's nothing to do about it. Don't get nasty or malicious; put all your effort into making a new best friend and remaining mature and nice by still saying hi to your friend in the halls, etc. Odds are, after you show him/her how nice you really are, they'll want to be friends again.
