 Wear many layers of clothes. Wear a few tanktops (about 3 or 4),about 2 shirts,and a jacket.Also,wear layers of underwear,sweatpants,and jeans. And wear running shoes because you need to run fast.
 Yellow and green ones still hurt,but not as much., The plug just ensures that if it isn't and you do shoot it by accident,the plug will take the hit., Have somebody run down the middle while 2 people go on each side. The person in the middle acts as a distraction. 1 guy on the sides runs as another distraction. The other person shoots the people who shoot at the distractions., Just watch the game as you can't help people when you are out., Once again run really fast back to a bunker. Have a teammate guard you,or you will most likely get shot., Congratulate people. You worked hard on this game and now it's time for a break.
