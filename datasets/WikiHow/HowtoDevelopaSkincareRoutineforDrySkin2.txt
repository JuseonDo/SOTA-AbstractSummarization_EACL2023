at school morning break time, or at your coffee break, nip to the toilets and apply another thin layer of the moisturiser you used in the morning.

@summary
while you're in the toilets, take the time to apply a good lip balm or butter (the body shop do great ones!).

@summary
also, buy a big bottle of water at this time.

@summary
at mid day, it's time for lunch.

@summary
before you have to go back to work/school/jobs etc after lunch, once again, pop into the toilets again.

@summary
during the rest of the day, eat healthily, drink loads, and keep on top of your dry skin by moisturising all the time.

 Again, massage it in thoroughly, and pay special attention to dry patches. Make sure your moisturiser is oil free, and if your skin still feels moisturised and hydrated before morning break, then skip this step.
 If you still like to wear lipstick and gloss as well, then apply a good layer of the balm before, and then use your lipstick/gloss/colour on top.
 Drinking water re-hydrates the skin from the inside, and even if you all ready have a drink with you, some extra liquid won't do any harm. A large drink will last you throughout the day.
 Grab another drink (as you ought to drink at least 2 litres of water each day), and get a healthy lunch. Water based fruit and veg are recommended to help dry skin, as well as fruit and veg rich in antioxidants and vitamin A, B, and C. A couple of ideas are to bring in a vegetable soup, and a fruit salad for desert, or maybe a healthy salad, a couple of pieces of fruit and some yogurt?

, You may want to top up on some moisturiser or sunscreen.
