 The lid must be opaque (not clear).;
, Only use enough to keep the coin intact, no more.
 Don't press too hard.
,,, For example: "As you can see, there is nothing in this jar."

, Then say: "I am going to slap this coin into this jar."

, Slap hard, making it seem as if you're attempting to push that coin right through the lid. You will need to slap hard enough that the coin falls off the Prestik and into the jar with a ping.
 Make sure to remove the coin from the lid fast enough so that the person can't see that you're also holding the original coin on the other side or that there is Prestik on that lid! Distract by shaking the jar, placing the lid in your pocket to lose the other coin and press it.


If someone wants to check the lid, be sure you've lost the other coin and peeled off the Prestic before handing the lid to them.
