Make your drawing a line drawing, like a picture in a coloring book.;

You must do this before you begin gluing seeds on - if you do it afterwards, you will knock seeds off when you hammer.



Apply glue to small areas of your picture, and apply seeds by dumping them on and pouring them off (works best for small seeds, like millet or poppy seeds).
Or, place them one by one, using a toothpick to move them into place.



Generally, you want to cover everything so that there are no spots of bare wood.



When completely dry, you may add a coat of spray acrylic or shellac to add a shiny finish to it.
