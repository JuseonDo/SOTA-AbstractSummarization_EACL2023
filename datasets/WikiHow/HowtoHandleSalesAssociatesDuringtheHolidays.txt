 Smiling goes a long way, and the associates are probably more exhausted than you are. They are there to help.;
, If you walk up to them and meekly ask them your question or stammer, they are going to assume you don't know what you are talking about and talk to you in a condescending manner. If they acknowledge that you know exactly what you are looking for, they are more likely to give you a clearer answer and will not get annoyed with you.
 Being polite and courteous to the employees makes their day a little better and they will be more willing to help you in the future.
 It will only frustrate them when they have to explain it again a second time. Also, you probably won't find it then either because they will be saying the same thing twice.
 By remembering their name and making a point to commend their customer service, they will receive a commission (if applicable) or a pat on the back from their employer. Also, this will keep their spirits high and enable them to continue with their customer support.
