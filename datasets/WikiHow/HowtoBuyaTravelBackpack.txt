 Even if you're not planning on canoeing or rafting, you could still encounter rain or snow in your travels. Invest in a travel backpack made of waterproof material to keep your belongings dry.;
, Buy a travel backpack that has features that will deter pickpockets and thieves. Look for hidden zippers, pockets the zip close to your body instead of away from you, and built-in locks. Internal compartments for phones, keys and identification will prevent thieves from lifting these important items from outer pockets.
 Look for padded backpack straps with non-slip material so you can wear it comfortably for long periods. Make sure the straps are adjustable so you can set them up to suit your height and weight.
 Choose a large or expandable model if you need to pack boots or camping gear, or opt for a more streamlined version with lined internal pockets if you need to carry guidebooks, a laptop computer or camera equipment.
 These packs might cost a little more initially, but the warranty will guarantee that you can replace or upgrade your pack if you need to, making them worth the investment.
 Consider cell phones, cameras, wallets, keys, first aid kits, guidebooks or maps and subway passes or tokens. You should be able to store all your essentials comfortably, access them easily and have room to add items.
