@article
 Measure the side or area of the glass object and cut enough plastic sheet to cover this side or area.;
, Cut out the shape of the area the design will sit inside (for example, a circle, square or other geometrical shape) from the center of the plastic sheet. Keep the cut-out piece, this will be reused shortly.
 The cut-out area must align exactly with where you want to apply the design.
 If you're confident enough, you can skip the tracing paper and draw straight onto the plastic adhesive cut-out. Otherwise, transfer the design from the tracing paper onto the adhesive plastic cut-out.
 Using the craft knife, cut around the outline of the design. Discard the pieces that are cut away.
 Run your thumbnail over the edges to smooth down.
 Use smooth strokes to apply, and brush on thickly.
 Rinse off with water.
 The remaining design should now be etched into the glass.
