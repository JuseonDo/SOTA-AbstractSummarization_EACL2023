If you are familiar with torrents, Xubuntu.org recommends that you use them if you do not know how or are unable to use torrent files select a country from the mirror list close to you.
 If you are not sure select the 32bit torrent or the latest release ending in “i386.iso” from the mirror site since the 32 bit version will run on 64 bit machines.
 For a USB drive try using Unetbootin; for optical drives use your favorite burner such as ImgBurn.
, This is different for every computer but most machines display directions while they boot like “press del for setup” or “F2 to enter Bios”. Once you are in the Bios Menu, go to your boot menu and make sure removable media is first on the boot list. Save changes and exit.
 From there follow the on screen instructions for installing Xubuntu.
