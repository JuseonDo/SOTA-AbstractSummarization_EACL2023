 Old-fashioned gingerbread doesnâ€™t take long to mix up, so your oven should be ready.
 Turn it on a medium setting until creamed.
 Mix until it is thoroughly combined.










You can substitute one cup (237ml) of honey and four tbsp. (47g) of brown sugar for the molasses and white sugar to make a traditional Alsatian gingerbread. Melt the sugars together on the stovetop before adding.










To make Alsatian gingerbread, replace the all-purpose flour with rye and whole-wheat flour in equal measure.
To increase the complexity of the flavors, halve the cinnamon and add one-half tsp. (0.9g) of ground anise, one-half tsp. (1.1g) of ground nutmeg and one-half tsp. (0.9g) of ground allspice.,,, Mix until combined.
,, Adjust baking time for a hot or uneven oven.
 If it comes out clean, take it out of the oven. Place the pan on a cooling rack for 20 to 30 minutes before serving.
