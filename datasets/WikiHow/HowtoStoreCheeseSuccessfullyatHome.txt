before buying, make sure the package is properly wrapped and sealed, and that the cheese inside looks appealing.

@summary
keep cheese in a covered container in your refrigerator on a clean, dry, lightly crumpled paper towel or two, leaving a little breathing room.

when mold starts to form, it will consume the oil and not the cheese; simply wipe it off, or rinse in tepid water.

keep washed rind, blue, flavored and white rind cheeses in separate containers to prevent mingling.

if it's for just a few days, an oversized resealable bag with a crumpled towel will do.

 Avoid any cheese that looks dry or discolored, as the seal may be broken or buy from a service counter from people who know their cheese. Check the freshness date on the package for fresh cheeses. When you get them home:









Fresh cheeses should be kept cold, in their original containers, and consumed quickly.
Unwrap all other cheeses immediately. Plastic wrap suffocates cheese.
Rub the surface of all but american, Grey, Bleu, and Washed Rind cheeses with olive, canola or other cooking oil. Rub only the cut faces of the White, Grey and Washed rinds. Bleu will protect itself.;
, Similar cheeses can not be stored together, as long as they donâ€™t touch. You can use plastic webbing, or the mats they use to roll up sushi, to stack in layers and still allow airspace.
 Dry, rub with fresh oil and store as above in a clean container with clean towels.
, Be sure to minimize contact so it can breathe.
 Wipe off any mold every couple of weeks as it forms. After a few treatments, mold will slow or cease to grow if your container has enough towels to soak up excess moisture. Change the towels and wash container often.
