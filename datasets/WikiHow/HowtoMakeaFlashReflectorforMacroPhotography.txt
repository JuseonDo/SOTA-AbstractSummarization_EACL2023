@article
 Be sure that it has been rinsed out pretty well.;
, You want it to be bigger than its final shape so that you can trim it down. Be sure that the corners are included in the cut.
 You want it to be able to be fastened to your flash and extend well past it. The actual length of a milk jug is about right.
 (What would be the inside of the container.)

, This can be:


Mylar from wrapping paper
Mylar gift balloons
Inside of a dry food bag
Aluminum foil

, You can use pretty much whatever type of tape you have that you believe is sturdy enough.


Chrome tape is recommended. Any kind of colored tape can reflect in shiny objects that are photographed.
 A rubber band would probably work best, but use what you have.
 This can be adapted for your purposes.
