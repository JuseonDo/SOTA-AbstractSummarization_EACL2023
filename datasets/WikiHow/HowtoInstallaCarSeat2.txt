 Each car seat requires different harness slots, so it's best you determine this information from the manual specific to the car seat you're using.
 The base should be flat on the seat of the car and the back should be straight up against the cushion. Raise or remove any head restraints if necessary.
 It should be marked with stickers (usually located in the back of the seat).
 If your car seat doesn't have tethers, consider calling your manufacturer to see if they can be added. They can increase the safety in your car., Consider having your installation double-checked by a child passenger safety technician to ensure proper installation.
