 The Day Care Center is a place where an older couple will take care of your Pokémon while you're on your journey. When you've been gone a long time, you can go back and get your Pokemon. They should be leveled up, and you didn't have to train them at all.;
, Even if you fall, you will still be okay.



1 foot/bikestep is the same as 1 exp. for those Pokemon.
