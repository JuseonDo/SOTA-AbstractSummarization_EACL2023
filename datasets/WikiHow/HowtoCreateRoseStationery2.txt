 Be sure you create a clean, even cut so your entire rose will transfer to the paper.
 You want the vegetable to be completely dry so it absorbs the ink (and doesn’t expel any water) so the drying time is very important.
 Do not press too hard or you may crush the vegetable. Make sure though that the bottom is fully coated evenly with ink.
 Do not remove too much ink, just enough to absorb any excess.
 Press firmly (but not too hard) onto stationery to transfer the design onto paper.
