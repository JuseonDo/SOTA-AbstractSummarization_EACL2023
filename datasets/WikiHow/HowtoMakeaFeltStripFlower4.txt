, Allow to dry before proceeding. The fold allows for the cut pieces to form loops that wonâ€™t undo., Do not cut all the way up; cut about 4cm and leave a border in place., Once the glue is in place, roll the length up along the glue. When it has rolled up, let it dry., The looped felt strip flower is now ready for use on a craft project or to be added to a hair accessory.
