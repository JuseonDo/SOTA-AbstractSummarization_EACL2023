 You will need rosewater (preferably organic, food grade), a 3-in-1 unscented shampoo, body wash, and bubble bath (found in the baby or bath section of most department stores), a funnel,and a bottle with lid (an empty shampoo bottle works fine).;
, Fill the bottle only halfway.
 Add enough rosewater to fill your bottle, but leave a small air space at the top.
 Do not shake!
