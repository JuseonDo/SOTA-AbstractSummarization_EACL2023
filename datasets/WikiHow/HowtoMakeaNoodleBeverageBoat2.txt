 This is the floating device to keep your beverage boat afloat on the “high seas”, so use a good quality new or undamaged pool noodle.
 Use either strong scissors or a very sharp knife to cut the noodle.


If your container is round, you may not even need to cut the noodle, but instead simply wrap it around the container.
 The rope will allow you to adhere the noodle parts to your boat. Thread the noodle parts together to create a square (or rectangular) shape that will fit snugly around your container.


Use a strong, secure rope or string with enough slack that extends beyond the boat. You will use the remainder of the string as your “pull” so your drinks are never far away.






Make a loop at the end of the string that fits easily around your finger or wrist, giving you easy access to your boat.
 Slide the noodle square or rectangle around your container and pull the string tight.


Create a snug fit by tying a small knot at the base of the string so that the noodle string does not expand and release the container of drinks.
 You could fill the container with other pool toys to determine how it holds weight.
