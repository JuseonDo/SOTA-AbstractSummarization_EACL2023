 Decide how many tiles you will need to use to complete your pattern.
 Do not measure the tile according to the ceiling or floor, since these surfaces are not always level. Place a batten horizontally across the wall, and use a level to make it straight.
 Mark where the tiles will go with a pencil, including spacers or grout. The batten will help you to keep the tile straight and evenly spaced, so do not avoid this time-consuming step.
 Pin a level vertical batten in place. This will ensure your first tiles are at a 90 degree angle.
 You can use a vertical straight edge to help align the tile uniformly. In small areas, you may need to apply the glue with a brush, but make sure it has a notched surface.
, Allow the tiles to dry according to adhesive directions in small areas, so that you can concentrate on making the tiles straight.
 Then, wipe away the tops of the tiles with a wet rag.
 You will need to use a wet cutter with a blade that goes in water. Measure each tile before cutting for a good fit.
 The glue directions should specify the necessary time.
