Crack an egg and pour the yolk and white into a bowl. Lightly beat the egg with a fork, and sprinkle the beaten egg with salt and pepper.
Pour cornmeal or flour into a separate bowl.
Place both bowls next to the stovetop so that you can batter your squash and then quickly drop it into the hot oil.
 Heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 C), checking the temperature with a candy thermometer.
 Then, dip the squash into the flour or cornmeal.
 Lower the contents of the basket into the heated oil.
 Remove them with the mesh basket, and place them on plates lined with paper towels to drain the oil.
 The pieces are flavorful enough to serve on their own, but you can also provide a small container of ranch dressing for dipping.
