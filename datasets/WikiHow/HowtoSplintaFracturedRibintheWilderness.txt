@summary
try settling down for a short time to see if the pain subsides a little.

@summary
expect to hurt worse in a day or two when the muscles become swollen and very sore.

@summary
,

@summary
get moving quickly, because you have to deal with it before you are extremely sore.

@summary
consider how the ribs are encased in muscles and connective tissues which may be extremely sore for weeks, and take several months to become comfortable and complete recovery to normal.

@summary

@summary
seek life-support immediately for the chest injury called flail chest: this occurs when two, three or more adjoining ribs are broken in two or more places.

@summary
expect simple, limited rib cracking and breaking to heal without any special wraps, but ask medical authorities.

@summary
wear a "rib belt" (if prescribed).

@summary
do "not" attempt to use a tourniquet on the ribs, chest, neck, head or torso -- there is no way.

@summary
once you get to civilization, rest and recuperation are the main treatment for sore, cracked or not too badly broken ribs.

 For the first few minutes you may feel like moving is not possible.


Apply pressure to open wounds, and attend to cuts and punctures, if any.





;
,, So, avoid unnecessary lounging, sleeping and resting for more than several minutes. It will mainly waste time.


Get emergency help, transportation if possible, medical advice and attention as soon as practical.






Expect little treatment and no surgery unless there are multiple fractures, open fractures, lung involvement, or complications such as infection, drainage of puncture wounds, etc.
, It may make breathing difficult and indicate possible internal bleeding. This will require pins, staples, screws or such stabilization of the flailing rib section.


Detect "flail chest" by a section of ribs moving in and out opposite to the rest of the ribs during breathing due to air pressures. It is most commonly seen in cases of serious blunt trauma (falling from a height, automobile wreck or other accident)., They will most often heal while held in line only by the other ribs and by your muscles. See your doctor and you will probably be told, "Take it easy from heavy work/lifting for a couple months.""There is no specific treatment for a rib fracture, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Adequate analgesia can avoid this" .






To bind the ribs tightly is not advised (without medical instructions). There is not much of a way to brace your ribs.
Wrapping may seem logical, but is of doubtful benefit.
To brace the ribs could cause rigidity and even induce more pain.
 The belt works like a girdle and may support the ribs and diaphragm.
 Tourniquets can only be used on arms and legs between the heart and the wound.


Expect to cause nerve damage and possible loss of a limb by using a tourniquet on an injured arm or leg.
