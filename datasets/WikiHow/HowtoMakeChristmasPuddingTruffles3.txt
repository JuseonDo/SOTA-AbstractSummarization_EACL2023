Take the red cherries and cut into small shapes that would pass for a red winter berry. Don't fuss too much––just little shapes are adequate, and they don't have to be round.






Take the green cherries and cut into small leaf shapes. These should be larger than the cherry shapes you've already cut.
 Help it melt faster by stirring occasionally but take care not to let any condensation drip back into the bowl.
 Allow it to cool for 10 minutes.
,, This will end up looking like holly with a berry on each truffle. Place in mini paper cases if desired.
