 You will need the basic shape to start out with.;
,, Once you have found your female on the concept layer, select your entire stick man and move it closer. That will make it easier to work with. Don't have it right beside it, because you will move your body there to work with it.
 Click on Path >> Object to Path. Note the gray diamonds in the corners now.
 Do this by double clicking in the correct area while in node edit.
 Select all five nodes and hold down CTRL and deselect the node for her breasts. You can also hold down SHIFT and click on the four nodes. You do this because most girls are not angular, but a bit round.
 You may have to unlock the layer and size it better.
 You may need to add more while doing this. The more nodes you have, the more control you have. If you make one by accident, you can click on it and hit DEL.
 To help the give the appearance of femininity, lower the eyes and the mouth just a bit. Select them and move them just a little bit lower.
 You know that clothes make the woman!
