 Doing so will open the Run utility, from which you can run the program that allows you to disable Microsoft Edge's InPrivate Browsing.

You will not be able to disable InPrivate Browsing on Windows 10 Home edition.
You can also right-click the Start icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen and then select Run from the ensuing pop-up menu.
 Make sure you spell it correctly and don't add any spaces., Doing so will open the Local Group Policy Editor.

If you aren't on an Administrator account, you may not have this option.
 This folder is in the left-hand pane of the Local Group Policy Editor window., You may first have to scroll down to find it., You may need to scroll down before doing so., Doing this will display the folder's contents in the pane on the right-hand side of the window., This will open the folder., It's near the top of the folder's contents., This enables the "Turn off InPrivate browsing" setting, which--counterintuitively, perhaps--disables InPrivate Browsing., Doing so will save your changes. Now anyone using Microsoft Edge on this computer or any networked computers won't be able to activate InPrivate Browsing.
