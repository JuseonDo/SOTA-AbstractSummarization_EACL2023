@summary
draw a semi circle onto a piece of card.

@summary
shape the semi circle like a tail fin.

@summary
cover with glitter.

@summary
glue to the base back of the clothespin.
@article
 Paint the card piece the same color as the glitter.
 This will require you to cut out the middle and curve the tail sides to appear realistic. Think of leaf shapes when forming this part.
 Allow to dry.
 Glue onto the existing glittered part. Allow to set before proceeding.


The clothespin part should be shorter than the tail fin; the edges of the tail fin should descend below the clothespin, fanned out to each side of the clothespin.
