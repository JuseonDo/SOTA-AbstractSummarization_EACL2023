 On the back of the computer, use a screwdriver to remove the two screws that hold the access panel in place, then slide and lift it away from you.
 Press in on the two plastic tabs which are next to the underlying green arrows, then rotate it away from you and lift it out., Most Compaq Evo towers have one or two CD drives and a floppy drive. Disconnect the power, data and CD drive cables (if any) from all drives. After disconnecting the cables, while holding the green button, pull each drive from the computer. Replace the drives by following this step in reverse order, but insert them horizontally and with the floppy drive at the top., On the back of the front panel, rotate the silver Compaq Evo logo upside down by pressing out on the two plastic clips. After rotating the logo upside down, with the back of the front panel facing you, remove the drive bezel by lifting it out, then rotate the drive bezel counterclockwise.,
