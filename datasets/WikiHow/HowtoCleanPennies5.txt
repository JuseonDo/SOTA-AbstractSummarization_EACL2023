 While this method should work on any penny, it's safe on the more recent ones, while the previous methods are not. The acidity of methods 1-4 will turn your zinc pennies black.








After 1982, copper became too expensive to justify using on a coin just not worth anything. Therefore, zinc (a much cheaper metal) started being used., If you are handy (or if you have a thousand pennies to clean), you could attach a pencil (with an eraser) to a drill and have it do the work for you. There is also, incredibly, such a thing as electric erasers. Who knew?!








, This will take about 10 seconds per penny. The only downside to this is at the end, your hand may be tired, and you will be out a pencil or two! Other than that, it is a quick and easy path to shiny riches.
