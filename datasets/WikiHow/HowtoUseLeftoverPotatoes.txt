 Some salad ideas include:


Potato salad
German potato salad (no mayonnaise)
Ranch potato salad
Spicy potato salad
Mediterranean potato salad

Country potato salad.
 It's delicious, especially drizzled with rosemary and olive oil.
 Just be aware that the skin gets very tough but it can keep lots of delicious stuffing inside, so simply mash up the inner potato and mix in corn kernels, salsa, sour cream, beans, whatever you like and enjoy a mini mash inside the skin.
 Mash up cold potato and add to the bread recipe as instructed.
