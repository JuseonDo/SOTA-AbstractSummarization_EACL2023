,, Every now and then, squeeze it and mash it a little to speed up the dissolving process.


You can mash it with a large wooden spoon or with your hands.
 Do this about 15 minutes after you've let the tamarind pulp stand. Using the back of a big spoon, push the remaining pulp through the strainer. This should allow the pulp to pass and the seeds, hulls, and any twigs to remain in the strainer.
 Dispose of the contents in the strainer.
 For any left over, pour into a jar and refrigerate. It will keep for up to one week.
