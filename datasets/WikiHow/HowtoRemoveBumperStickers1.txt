, Don't hold it in one place — keep it moving back and forth, up and down, to evenly heat up the sticker. Holding a heat gun or hair dryer in one place can cause damage by bubbling the paint.


If the corner of the sticker does not start to lift, continue to heat the sticker.
Hold heat gun 8" – 12" from sticker. They get much hotter and work much faster than a hair dryer.
 Do not pull directly up. Pull back, folding the corner over against the face of sticker.
, Then clean off the remaining adhesive with an automotive adhesive cleaner such as PPG Ditzo DX 440. You may need to re-apply wax to the area.


WD-40 also works, spray it on and let it sit a few minutes then wipe and rub.
Removing glue takes patience, and may require multiple applications of cleaner.
