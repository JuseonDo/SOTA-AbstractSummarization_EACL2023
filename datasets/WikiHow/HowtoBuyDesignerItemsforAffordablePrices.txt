 If you are a teen and thinking of buying a YSL top, think again. You'll grow out of it and it can actually be a waste of money.;
, Those items could include scarves, purses, and many other items.
 Actually, real designer purses still look elegant after many years!! You can actually buy them from consignment stores. Sometimes you can find them from high-end thrift shops, or try going to thrift shops in a wealthy area.
 Sure, eBay is filled with thousands of knock-offs, but sometimes, there are some real designer pieces! Just make sure they are not fakes. Fakes are tacky.
 They sell some overstock items for less.
,, Every few days, there is a new sale featuring items from a different designer, at much lower prices than retail.
