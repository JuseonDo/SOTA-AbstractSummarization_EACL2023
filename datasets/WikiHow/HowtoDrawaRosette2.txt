 This will be the base.


If you have multiple number pencils, you will want to use a softer lead for this part.  You will either erase or eventually cover these markings.  If you only have one pencil, that's okay, too! Just draw very lightly.
 This will create a 'petal'.
  The spirals will not match, which is what it's supposed to do in order to make a pretty rosette.
