 Select a chair that can be painted with latex or oil-based paint. Wood chairs are the easiest to paint.



Latex paints offer quick and easy cleanup, but take longer to dry than oil-base.
Oil-based paints are more resistant to chipping and scratching. Oil-based paints have a strong smell, sometimes lingering for days. When using oil-based paint, keep area well ventilated.
The type of brushes needed will be determined by the type of paint you choose.
Brushes made of polyester filaments can be used for any type of paint as they do not absorb water like natural or nylon bristles. Natural bristles work best with oil-based paints.
, Primer is used for metal rather than wood chairs.
 Sanding with 100 grit sandpaper should always be done prior to painting. Sand until surface is smooth. Wipe the chair with a damp cloth to remove sanding residue.
 Stir with paint stick. Pour small amounts of paint into separate pan or container for easier portability while painting.
 Allow sufficient time to dry. Most chairs will require a second coat to cover any missed spots.


Apply each coat thinly for a more even finish and to prevent drips caused by too much paint. Use a third or fourth coat if necessary.
, Use paint thinner in ventilated area.
;
, Wipe out the oil grease from your chair and then leave it to dry.
,, Primer paint is the base coating for your paint color of your chair. It adds durability to the paint. Leave it to dry.
, Apply 2 or 3 coatings, and then leave it to dry.
