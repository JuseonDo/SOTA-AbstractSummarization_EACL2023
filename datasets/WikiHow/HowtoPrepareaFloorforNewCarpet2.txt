Dangers from carpet removal include injury by nails or tacks, inhalation of dust and contact with mildew or mold. If you have a sensitive respiratory system or you suspect mold, wear a breathing mask.
, Go to the corner of the room and pull up at the edge with the pliers. It is likely that you will be removing the carpet from tack strips that help to pull the carpet and hold it down at the corners.
 This will loosen the carpet and allow you to take off entire lengths of it.
 This will allow you to roll it up from the end and carry it out in manageable strips. Carpet is extremely heavy, so it is a good idea to remove it in pieces unless you plan on saving the entire piece.
 Use force to pull up as much of the foam as you can. There will be little pieces of foam stuck to staples that you will remove later.
 These are very securely attached to the ground in 2 to 4 foot (0.6 to 1.2 m) sections.


Place the small pry bar under a corner or edge of the tack strip. Tap the pry bar with the hammer to insert it further underneath. In most cases, the nails will come out of the flooring as you bring up the tack strips. Continue going around the room to remove all the tack strips with the pry bar.
If you want to keep the quality of hardwood floor beneath a tack strip, place a small piece of wood beneath the pry bar to avoid dents and scrapes.
, You will need to carry a container to place the staples in, so you do not leave them on the ground.


Use a flat head screwdriver or a pair of pliers to yank out the staples 1 by 1. This is a fairly tedious job in large carpeted areas.
 The light should flash on metal surfaces. Sweep the floor to ensure you get up any pieces of metal before you start your cleaning process.
