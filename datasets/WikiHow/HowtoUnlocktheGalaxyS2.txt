 Developers have found that the unlock code for the Galaxy S is hidden in files that can only be recovered by those with root access. The GalaxSIM app extracts the unlock code from your device, then uses the code to perform an automatic factory unlock.



Alternately, navigate to the GalaxSim page on the Google Play Store site at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spocky.galaxsimunlock&hl=en and click “Install.” The app will immediately begin downloading to your device.
, The app will run a script to locate the unlock code, unlock your device, then inform you when the process is complete.
, Your Galaxy S is now unlocked.
