 You will usually choose the type of 'background removal' after you pick the image.;
,, It comes with many options that you can change as you become more familiar with Gimp.
 You can decide from a variety of brushes to get the look you want.
 For the beginning, bigger is better. You can clear out the majority of the background using a large brush.
 This one was used with a brush at the scale of 10.
, As your brush gets smaller and your residual background gets less, you will need to zoom into your photo.
 It may appear that you are done, but there are probably some minuscule pieces of background that you have missed.
 Those were 'discovered' by clicking on the 'fuzzy select' (magic wand) tool and click on the white area.
 Once you have removed as much background as possible, use the magic wand to make a selection and then invert the selection.
 How much you shrink it depends on the scale of the image.
 Click on Select > Feather and choose an appropriate degree of feathering. This enables the flower to blend in better with its future background.
 To copy the image, click on CTRL C and then SHIFT CTRL V. This will paste your picture as a new image with a transparent background.
 Again select where the background was. Click on Select and grow. This will help to be sure there are no blank spots.
