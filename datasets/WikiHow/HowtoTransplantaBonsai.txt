 On average, about every two years is a good space of time before transplanting but it will depend on the bonsai you're growing. If in doubt, ask at your local nursery.;
,, You can use a bamboo skewer or similar item to help you untangle the roots and remove loose soil.
 You may even want to cut more. Cut off roots that grow upward and any thick roots that are growing down. This will give the impression from the top that the tree is anchored firmly. Leave any thin roots of around the same size. Repeated transplanting will help the sense of stability over the years.
 Pass a thin wire through and secure underneath to keep the drainage mesh in place. Cut off any excess wire.
 This is for securing the bonsai.
 The soil should be porous to allow the passage of air and able to retain moisture.
 Check how it is sitting and reorient it as required. The trunk base should be placed a little higher than the rim of the pot. Fasten the wire that you place facing upwards, to secure the tree in place. Cut off any excess wire and bend the wire down into the soil to prevent injury.
 Mix this with finer soil and river sand. Fill the pot to about four-fifths full; use tweezers to push the soil in, and to create airspace between the roots.


The soil should finish just below the rim of the pot.
, Gently pat down using your fingertips.
 Always refresh the soil completely and discard of the old soil.
