You should see a white plastic tube called an overflow tube in the tank.






Attached to the tube will be the flapper guides, two arms that hold either side of the rubber flapper. This sits near the bottom of the overflow tube.






Attached to the guide arms is the flapper, a round piece of rubber that is supposed to fit tightly in a hole in the bottom of the tank.






Attached to the top of the flapper will be a chain or metal rod.






The chain or rod is hooked to a bar at the top of the tank, which is generally attached to a mechanism on the overflow pipe near the top.






There is another rod in the toilet that turns on and shuts off the flow of water into the tank. The level of water can be controlled by a float ball on a rod or by a mechanism that turns like a dial.



When you push down on the flush handle the bar at the top lifts, pulling the flapper out of the hole.






The flapper floats for a moment but as the water drains out of the tank it should settle back into the hole, closing it off.






After the flapper closes the hole the toilet fills with water to the top of the overflow tube, when it should stop.
 Generally they hook into holes in the rod. Use the middle hole first. Try another if the flapper doesn’t seal right.
, There are 2 ways.


Move the hook on the chain to a different hole on the bar.






Move the hook on the chain further down to shorten it.






The chain should be fairly straight between the flapper and the bar when the flapper is properly seated in the hole.
 Otherwise you can straighten the wire and bend it back a little shorter.
,, There should be a turn off valve below the tank. In some cases you may need to go into a basement beneath the toilet to find the valve.
,, You may need to turn it off and try again.
 This is a simple job. Just follow the package directions.
