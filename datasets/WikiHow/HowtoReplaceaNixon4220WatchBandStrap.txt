 You will need the following:


Clean, dry, soft work surface.
1-2 small flat-head screwdrivers such as eyeglass screwdrivers.
Replacement 20-21mm watch band, for example, a Shinola 20mm Black Rubber Strap.;
, Only one of these screws can actually turn - the other has a set pin attached to it, preventing it from rotating any more than a small amount. Looking at the face of the watch, the fixed screws are the two at the upper left (11 o'clock) and lower right (5 o'clock). The screws you want to turn are the other two, at the upper right (1 o'clock) and lower left (7 o'clock).
 It may help to steady the other screw with a second screwdriver, but it shouldn't be required since it is secured by a set pin.


The screw you remove will be short; the remainder of the lug screw is one long piece with a matching screw head that has a small set pin attached to it.
, Start with the half of the replacement band that has the buckle. If your band has a free loop (free ring), remember to slide it onto the buckle before attaching it. Position the buckle half of the band in place at the top lug (the one near 12 o'clock), and attach it by threading one of the long fixed screw pins through the end of the band which should have an opening for it.
