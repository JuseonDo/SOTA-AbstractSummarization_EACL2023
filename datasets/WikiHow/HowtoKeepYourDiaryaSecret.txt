 Like, don't buy a diary that says 'diary' across the front. Just buy a cute one that could be a school textbook, or whatever. It's a good idea to buy your diary when you are out alone, so that nobody gets suspicious.;
, Not in the typical places, like under your bed or in a pillowcase. Hide it between the mattresses of your bed, In that purse at the back of your closet you never use, or even tucked away in the back of your bookshelf.
, Across it, write, 'my diary, do not enter'. Inside, write a few pages of fake entries.
, Example: "So, yesterday I was writing in my diary, and..."

,, nobody will suspect a thing.
 They will understand and leave you alone. But if you have truly nosy parents, they will be suspicious of you and not know why you don't want them to read your diary. Talk some more, calmly and respectfully.
