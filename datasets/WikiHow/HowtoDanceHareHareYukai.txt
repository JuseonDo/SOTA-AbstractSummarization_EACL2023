 If you are a girl, you should choose, Mikuru Asahina, Haruhi Suzumiya, or Yuki Nagato.If you are a boy you will want to choose Kyon or Itsuki Koizumi. Keep in mind that Yuki, Haruhi, and Mikuru appear at the beginning of the dance and stay there, until they end, while Kyon and Itsuki will begin to dance after the first verse of song.;
, You can easily find out what the characters wear, and try to cosplay. It will be hard to make costumes if you don't know how to sew, and buying them will cost you money. You don't have to cosplay.
 It should have a computer nearby so that you can listen to the song or watch a youtube tutorial.
 Do it part by part and it will be much easier.

Point left, with your whole arm being a 180 degree angle. Obviously you can't point a 180 angle just standing straight; it will not work. To achieve this step, simply turn your torso 45 degrees towards the left and point left. This should make your right shoulder pointing forward.






From pointing left, move your hand over your face while simultaneously making it a "jazz hand".






Keeping your "jazz hand", only move your elbow to make your arm straight on the right side. This move should look like a semi-circle.







Bend your arms into you... bring them down.






Now put them to your sides, still sticking out.






Now to your hips, with your elbows locked!
