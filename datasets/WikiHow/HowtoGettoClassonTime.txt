 This way, in the morning when you come, you can go straight to your locker and get about enough books for three periods. This will help you avoid hallway traffic during each passing period.;
, Keep a calendar, an organizer, perhaps a locker shelf, and pens and pencils in your locker. A pad or a white erase board can assist you also. This way, you can get in and out of your locker and to class quickly.
 This will help you can mark your classes and your routes to each of them. Use different colors for different classes, and draw arrow marks to which direction you're going and at what time.
 You shouldn't go to your locker too often. If you pass your locker on the route to one of your classes, get your books then. Try not to move out of your pathway to access something.
 Put your books in the order of your schedule to cut off on in between-classes time. Get your books for your first few classes (or the classes that you have until you can get to your locker) and put them in your bag. Then go to your first class.
 Sometimes you may need to excuse yourself as you push through people.
 If you can, it's always better to go to your locker before your lunch break (since you can't be late to that period) and get the necessary materials for the rest of the day. It will make it easier for you to get to your classes after lunch, while avoiding crowded hallway staircases.
, Knowing the time can easily help you keep track of how fast you need to move. Train your watch to the same scheduling as your school bells.
 Itâ€™s almost unavoidable, but the only way to make it to class on time is to go straight to it. However, you can walk with a classmate who has the same class as you and talk.
