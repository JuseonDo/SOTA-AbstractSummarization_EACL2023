 Any table with an uncrowded space will be ideal.;
, Bring the left side over to the right. You should now have a rectangle half the size of your handkerchief.
 Don't fold it evenly in half; leave a little room at the top (~1.5in). However much you want to stick out of your pocket determines how much you fold.
