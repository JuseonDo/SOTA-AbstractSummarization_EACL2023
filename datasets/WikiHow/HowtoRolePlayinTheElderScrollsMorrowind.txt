 Depending on your mood or personality, you may choose a character similar to yours or the opposite.;
, For example, a gruff dwarven fighter; shining, tall Paladin; or delicate, aloof magician.
 that fits your chosen character.
 Remember that people in the game world will call you by this name.
 For Morrowind, I often put this into the class description, or you can add it to your own journal. The more vivid and detailed the better, as it will shape your character throughout the game.
 Say you chose a big, heavy fighter. What background and personal characteristics can you apply to your character to make him unique? Does he hate thieves? Does he only use blunt weapons? Does he refuse to use magic (not smart enough, perhaps?) Does your fighter have a mean streak and kill anyone that insults his or her equipment?

, Choose to limit yourself to things that fit into the character you have chosen. Just because you know there is a better item in the next cave, does your character know that item would be there? Would your character choose to enter the cave? These motivations can and will shape your experience each and every time.
