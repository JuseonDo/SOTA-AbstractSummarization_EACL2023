,, Usually a recipe will describe what size the pieces of vegetables should be before they are sweated. If not, use these guidelines.


If the aromatic vegetables will be used to make a sauce or will be strained or mashed, the pieces should be small, about 1/4” (.6 cm) in size.
If the vegetables will be used in a stew or a dish that will cook for a long time, the pieces should be larger: 1/2” to 3/4” (1.3 to 1.9 cm) in size.
Cut tomatoes in half, then scrape out the seeds and “gel” and discard them before dicing tomatoes.
Remove the seeds and the white membrane from peppers before dicing them.
Smash or finely mince garlic cloves before adding them to the rest of your aromatic vegetables.
, It may call for grated, minced or powdered ginger.
 Generally, you don’t lose much volume during the sweating process; if a recipe calls for 2 cups of sweated vegetables; start with about 2½ cups of fresh vegetables. If the recipe gives you actual amounts of vegetables to sweat, use those amounts.
