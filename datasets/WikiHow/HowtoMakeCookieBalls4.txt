1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda

, Whisk to combine., Beat until light and fluffy, using an electric mixer., Mix in thoroughly., Mix well until combined. The resulting dough will be very firm and will seem dry; that's expected. Do not mix too much.,, Place straight onto the baking sheet. When you have transferred all of the dough, place in the freezer., This freezing process makes it more likely that the balls will stay in a ball shape during baking., Remove the balls from the freezer. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or just slightly browned., Allow to cool. They should have remained in little balls. Once cooled, they're ready to serve.
