 You could also use broken mirror pieces that you might have at home but they need to be small pieces and not too sharp. Mirror pieces from the craft store will be in a safe mosaic form, already smoothed down for you.;
, Use a glue gun or super glue to add the pieces to the vase. Use any pattern or random approach as wished. Allow to fully dry.


Keep the mirror pieces as flat as possible, don't have any jagged edges sticking out from the vase.
 This step is optional.
