@summary
arrange your team into "battle buddies," which are two men or women who will fight together.

@summary
this tactic is used for movements, i.e.

@summary
the most important step is the cover fire.

@summary
the second most important thing in this is timing.

@summary
after five seconds if there is no cover, hit the deck even if you are laying in a dip in the ground.

@summary
for retreating you do the same thing as in moving forward; the only difference is that you should detour to your partner and tap him on the back to let him know where you are at.

@article
 Make as many teams as is necessary.;
, attack/advance or retreat/withdraw.
 Call "moving!" Your buddy should respond "covering!" When covering it is important that they are shooting. It doesn't matter if they can see anyone or not, the important thing is making sure that nobody wants to see who they are shooting at.
 When you call moving your buddy starts shooting, run for 3-5 seconds. If you run longer than this a number of things can go wrong, such as somebody deciding that they aren't being shot at and risking shooting at one of you two. Your ally could hit a reload. Remember that as soon as your partner stops firing for any reason they will start.
 You should be fine because remember, you only have to be there for three to five seconds. Once on ground or behind cover yell "set!" to signal to your ally that you are ready to cover his advance. When he is moving you cover him.
