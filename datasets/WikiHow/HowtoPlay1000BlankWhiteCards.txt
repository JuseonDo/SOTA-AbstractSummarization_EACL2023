, If none of your cards can be played, then draw another card.
 The card will stay in front of that player, being one of their 'cards in play', if it has a permanent effect. For example, a card that says 'stay absolutely still for 1 turn' will probably be placed in the discard pile after it is played, having no permanent effect. If it also says '-50 points', than it will stay in front of that player, so that it can be tallied at the end of the game.
 Don't get too carried away on your first game, but cards can do anything. Most cards add or take away points, but most cards also have a second effect, such as requiring you to discard a card each turn, draw two cards, or dance before playing a card.
 Don't worry if you aren't good at art.
 The game ends when the person whose turn it is has no cards he can play AND the deck is empty.
, Each player chooses at least half of their stack to be culled. They go through it and get rid of all the bad cards, the ones that aren't funny, the ones that get into 'bigger gun fights' (see tips). You can keep the culled cards or throw them away, or even light them next July 4th.
 Mix in blanks until it's about at a one-in-five ratio. Use that deck to play with next time, according to the instructions.
