 Most people choose a relatively small branch with several limbs.;
, White or silver would be good colors for weddings. You might want to paint it the color of your wedding theme, such as pink.
 If your branch is white, you may want to purchase a white flower pot. You could put the branch in a flower pot and then place this pot in a larger decorative container.
 This will weigh the pot down, so it will not tip over.
 Be sure to allow plenty of time for the clay to dry.
 You can use tissue paper or cloth.
 You can tie decorative ribbons around on the tree or add decorative flowers or ornaments to the tree. Be creative and try to match the wedding theme.
 You can use paper clips, plastic clips, or even small white clothespins. You may want to scatter a few of these clips around the base of the money tree.
 The poem should include the reason for the wedding money tree and a thank you to the guests for contributing to the tree.
 This will let the guests know that this is a money tree, so they may add their own bills.
