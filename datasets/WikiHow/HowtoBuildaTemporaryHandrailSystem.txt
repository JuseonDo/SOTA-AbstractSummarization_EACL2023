@summary
look at the construction methods used in the building to determine what type of supports will work best for your handrail system.

@summary
decide what the load capacity of your system should be.

@summary
consider alternate methods for projects where conventional handrails built with cables and steel posts, or wooden rails on metal or wood posts are not practical.

@summary
design your handrail system with the existing conditions in mind.

@summary
estimate the amount of materials you need.

@summary
lay out the location for the handrail posts, then, using a safe access method, install them.

@summary
fasten the posts around all edges requiring protection.

@summary
attach the handrail system to the structural members of the building where possible to increase its strength.

@summary
install the handrail material after you have installed the posts.

@summary
install the access ladder or other means for workers to climb to the elevated area.

 Steel framed multistory buildings may require welded handrail posts, while wood framed construction would require wood posts, or metal posts with fastening flanges installed on them.
 Government agencies in the United States like OSHA (and similar agencies in other countries) set standards for fall protection. In the case of the USA, these standards can be viewed at the OSHA website,while the US Army Corps of Engineers handbook also has specific requirements that must be met on a project they are overseeing., Safety nets systems, warning lines, safety harnesses, and safety spotters may be used in some jurisdictions under some conditions; you'll need to check the relevant regulations and requirements for your location., For the handrail system shown in the illustrations, a steel angle surrounds the perimeter of the second floor work area, so steel tubing with cables and angle iron bracing is used. The cables are attached to structural columns to anchor the cable handrails., Typical handrail post spacing lay on 8 foot (2.4 meters) centers, so you will need one post per eight feet (2.4 meters) of protected length. You may need two cables or rails, so you can figure double the outside perimeter length for this material. Also, consider whether a toe-board is needed to protect people working below the edge of the elevated platform from falling objects., Using an aerial lift can make this step easier. Otherwise, access the platform by other means, using a safety harness and related fall protection devices to protect the installer., Keep them as plumb as possible, and make sure the means you use for attachment will hold the required load., This will also reduce the number of handrail posts you will need for the job., Keep in mind that in most cases, all workers present at the elevated work area must use supplemental fall protection until the handrail system is complete, and this includes the person installing it., Make sure ladders are secured, and the top of the ladder extends 3 feet (91cm) above the deck.
