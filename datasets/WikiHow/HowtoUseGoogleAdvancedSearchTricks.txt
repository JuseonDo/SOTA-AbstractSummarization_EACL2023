 It looks like a very simple search engine. In actuality it is but it can be used for much more. Over to the right of the search box, there are three links: Advanced Search, Preferences, and Language Search.


Advanced Search - If you press Advanced Search, a page comes up with many different options.
In the box labeled "All these words" is your standard search box like the one on the front page.
The box "this exact wording or phrase" doesn't contain words in the middle of a sentence. It will surround the words with quotes "". For example, if you type in "wikiHow is Awesome" in the this exact wording or phrase box, the search won't include a page with "Is wikiHow useful? Many people asked do think it is useful and awesome" but will include "wikiHow is Awesome. This is why I think so.";
, For instance, you could search with the box "Chicken OR Gravy" the search would include pages about chicken and others about gravy.
 This box lets you not include certain words in your search. This box puts a - before the word. For example, if you search for "Bass" as in the fish, you could type in "Bass -Sing" to find pages that have Bass in them and not about singing.
 This option isn't very necessary. If you search an English word, then you will probably get English.
"File Type" let's you select which kind of file you want the search result to be. So if you want to find .pdf files then you would select Adobe Acrobat PDF.
"Search within a site or domain" lets you search inside a certain website or a extension like ".edu"
