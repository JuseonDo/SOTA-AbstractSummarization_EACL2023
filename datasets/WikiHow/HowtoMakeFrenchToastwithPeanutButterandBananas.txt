 If you want to use packaged French toast from the store, that works, too.

As a general rule of thumb, soak a slice of bread in some beaten eggs. Then place them in a griddle pan on the stove and cook them until each of the sides are cooked evenly but not burned.
Make as many slices as you'd like, and spread them out on a plate.;
, Be careful that you don't cut down far enough into the bread to slice it.,, Plantains work too and give the dish a Latin American flavor.,, Then enjoy!

Cantaloupe and melon slices can also be added on the side.
