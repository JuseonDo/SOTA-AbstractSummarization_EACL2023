 With most cars, you will have to pinch the connector to release it.;
,, One side of the wire is held in by a screw. The wire will pivot at the screw.
 The wire should now pivot freely away from the bulb. You can now remove the bulb.
 Make sure the bulb is in properly (check the picture).
 Press in on the wire and lock it back in place.
,, Troubleshooting:


Check the headlight fuse first.
If the new bulb doesn't work, check the old one to make sure it's burned out. Sometimes burned out bulbs are obvious but some only show a minor discoloration of the filament. If you suspect the old one did not burn out, wiggle the electrical connection.
If the new bulb won't work and the old one looks fine there is an electrical problem.
If you suspect an electrical problem and you've got a multimeter and a lot of patience, you can find the cause. If you have neither, go see a mechanic.
