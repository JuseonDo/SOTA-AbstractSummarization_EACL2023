 For example, "The boy who sits in the front row." Here the relative clause is "who sits in the front row", which modifies the subject clause "the boy." In this sentence, who has the role of a pronoun.
 By that he refers to a topic known by the audience.
Interrogative pronoun, such as, "Who is the boy sitting in the front row (showing John in front row)?" Hence, who is a reference to John.
Indefinite pronouns, such as, "Anybody could sit in the front row (among them John)." Here, anybody refers to John.
Reciprocal pronouns, such as "Teacher and students started arguing with each other." Again, each other refers to teachers and students.
