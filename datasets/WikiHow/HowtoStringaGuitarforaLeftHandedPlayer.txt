 You may have to make a new one from a blank. (You can get a blank from any local guitar store.) Try to match up the nut height with the old one only reversed. Place it in the slot (Don't glue it yet)

, The string should be very close to the first fret. Touching or very close to touching. When the string is plucked open it should have no buzz in it. Adjust height until these have been met. If it is your first time it might be easier to have a few blanks.
 (A dab will do ya!) The glue is to keep the nut from shifting, the strings will do most of the job in keeping it on.
 Set the intonation.
