 Mostly use a Sim with the "unlucky" trait, so the Grim Reaper will come and let them stay alive.
 This way, the Grim Reaper will try to strike up a conversation with an evil Sim.
 Maybe flirt a bit. Then hold "ctrl" + "shift" + "c" and press the "add to household" option.
 If he doesn't stay, kill the unlucky Sim again and again, until he stays long enough for you to interact with him.
