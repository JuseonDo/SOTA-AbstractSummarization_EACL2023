@summary
if you're up around 4-6 in the morning, chances are your parents aren't.

@summary
now, if you're bored with the stuff above, if you have a sibling (preferably older, the younger ones need to sleep!),

@summary
don't open anything unless you're allowed to.

@summary
after you've looked at the presents and maybe opened a thing or two, you and your sibling can go make hot chocolate to drink or something small to eat.

@summary
now before you go running into your parents' room yelling "it's christmas!
@article
 Maybe try going back to sleep for a bit. If you don't want to go back to sleep, maybe go on your phone or laptop, or just watch T.V. for a while, or go down stairs to grab a quick snack, or make your favorite hot chocolate!;
, go wake them up, or go see if they are up. Then the two of you can creep down/upstairs and take a look at your presents! Take a look around and play a guessing game about what stuff is.
 This is very important, because your parents may want to see your reaction to the gift that they got you, or that Santa got you. Some parents allow you to go look and maybe take something small out of a stocking. But only if they say so. No one wants to get in trouble on Christmas!

, Then go watch some television.
 Wake up! I wanna open presents!" Maybe try making their favorite tea/coffee or make a small breakfast. They might like that more than yelling kids. Give them time to wake up, and then when they are ready, you can start the fun.
