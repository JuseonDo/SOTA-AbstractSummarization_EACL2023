 Some pieces are very fast and harsh, while others are very graceful, slow and light. Some music is done with a voice, some with string instruments, and some with woodwind and brass. Knowing what kind you like to listen to will make it a whole lot easier to listen as well.;
,, You need to give it a chance to learn to like it. Listen to the notes, patterns, and small details. Notice what each instrument brings to the piece.
 Try to pick out the sounds of individual sections like the strings, woodwinds, brass or percussion. Discerning these components of the music can increase your appreciation of the piece. Then pick out individual instrument and see if you can hear the part they play.
 Consider the religious message behind the music and how that influences the sound.
 Classical instruments include flute, clarinet, violin, viola, cello, oboe, and even classical guitar. Get a good classically-trained teacher to start off.
