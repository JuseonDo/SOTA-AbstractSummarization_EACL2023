 Hashtags help you to get discovered by other users and your photos are more likely to get liked. Using a lot of hashtags increases the likelihood that your photos will be viewed and shared.;
, For example, if you have a picture of your wiener dog, possible hashtags you can use are #wienerdog, #dog, and #pet.
 Some of the most popular hashtags are #love, #me, #cute, #friday and #coffee.
 Keep in mind that using a popular hashtag can also make your photo more likely to be lost.Also, you can go to #likeforlike or #like4like and like a lot of photos. Not everyone likes back, but at least you get some likes.
