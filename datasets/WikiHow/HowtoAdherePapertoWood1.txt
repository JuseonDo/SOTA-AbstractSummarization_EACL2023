 Child-safe glue like Elmer's Glue is also made from PVA; however, it is a low-quality version of the product. Ask for bookbinder's glue to ensure you are getting a strong, durable product.


It is a good idea to choose a neutral PH adhesive. This non-acidic glue will not deteriorate the paper that you plan to glue to your wood.;
,, If you are using a very thin paper, you may find that the glue needs to be thinned in order to avoid bubbling.


You can thin the glue by adding water to it in another container. Add slowly and stir until you reach the desired consistency.
 If you have painted the wood, it will be much harder to adhere the paper and you should make sure to use the glue in its original form.
 Depending upon the size of the project, you may want to ask a friend to help you line it up.
 Apply it to the wood's surface until you have a consistent, thin layer.
 Make sure to get all corners. You can wipe up overlapping glue.



If you have extra paper, you can overlap the paper over the wood to ensure a good even surface. After it has dried, you can cut a clean edge with a razor knife and mat.
 You can also wear plastic gloves and smooth the paper with your hands.
 Trim the edges, if necessary.
