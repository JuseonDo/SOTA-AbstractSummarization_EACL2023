 The front side of the panty should be facing up. Make sure the crotch end of the panty is closest to you.









Make sure the panty is as flat as possible by smoothing your hand over the fabric.
 It should be flush with the top of the panty. Run your hand over the panty once more to flatten it as much as possible before you start folding.
 The ends should meet at the center of the panty.Your panty should now be folded into thirds.
 You should now have a neat little square. Use this method to save space. It is the simplest and most compact method.
 Place them side by side and vertically inside your dresser or storage compartment. They should look like tiny files in a filing cabinet.









You can now choose the pair you want without messing up the rest of them.
If you want to organize them further, stack them by order of color.
