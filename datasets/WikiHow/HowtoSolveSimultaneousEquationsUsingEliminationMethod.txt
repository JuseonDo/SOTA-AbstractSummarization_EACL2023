write down both of the equations that you'll need to solve.

number the equations.

@summary
check if both equations have the same variable/unknown term in them.

@summary
look for signs of the unknown variables or terms.

@summary
solve to find the first unknown variable from the resulting (rather shortened) equation.

@summary
25 divided by 5 makes 5 so we have now found the value of "x" which is 5.

3x - y = 12
2x + y = 13;
, 3x - y = 12 as number one, and 2x + y = 13 as number two.
, Remember subtraction can also be referred to as the addition of a negative number. If the signs are the same, subtract both equations. If they are different then add the equations.


3x - y = 12
+ 2x + y = 13
-------------
5x = 25







, Divide both sides by the coefficient of the left side. Take 5 to the other side.It will look like this:x = 25/5.
, Use the value of x that was obtained above into either equation (but stick with this equation for the time being). Substitute this value of x into the equation.

3x - y = 12






3(5)-y = 12






15 - y = 12






- y = 12 - 15






- y = - 3(divide both sides by negative one, will be able to cut both signs)






y = 3







, Substitute both the values into the other equation. If the two side numbers at the very end equal each other, you've correctly solved this system of simultaneous equations.


3x - y = 12
3(5) - 3 = 12
15 - 3 = 12
12 = 12
