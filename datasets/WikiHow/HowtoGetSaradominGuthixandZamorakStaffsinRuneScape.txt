 Level 60 is required to wield the staff or even enter the battle to fight kolodion.
 recommended shark or better. sara brews are not recommended because it lowers your magic. rocktail will increase your hp without doing damage to your combat stats., Recommend is an air staff, 400 blood, and 800 fire so you can cast them outside the arena,,,,,, Then go to the staff merchant. Staffs are 80,000 gp but the first one is free., you will need 200 blood runes for each staff when you're training, so if you wanna train all the staffs, you'll need 600 blood runes, unfortunately, they're not the cheapest runes you can buy. it's very expensive each time you cast the spells. you mus be wielding the staff to cast the spell. you don't have to kill kolodion to get the other 2 staffs. note, you can still be pked while you're training.

Every cast counts no matter if it misses or not.
 castle wars is a good place.
