get an electric gun that costs $70 or more.

@summary
buy as much (highly polished,high-grade,) ammo as possible.

@summary
buy spare mid-cap mags(although hi-cap means you can shoot longer at the price of self-winding the magazines and making rattling noises when moving), a good tactical vest, and a red dot sight.

@summary
.23 gram and .25 gram bbs are more effective than .12s and .20s, but have a lower fps(feet per second).

@summary
accuracy and consistency are more important than fps.

@summary
practice, practice, practice.

@summary
gather an even number of friends and play and possibly make a team.get to know your opponents and their strengths and weaknesses.

 Cheaper guns are often unreliable and less effective. Note: A multi-shot shotgun is fine as long as you can cock and shoot it effectively. Getting a single shot shotgun is usually a pretty bad idea, as you are shooting an often inaccurate spring rifle.;
, There is three common weights of bbs. .25; .20 and .12. Try to get seamless bbs, non seamless bbs can potentially break inside your airsoft gun, causing it to malfunction. Any weight is good, depending on your airsoft guns fps. If it has high fps, meaning its stronger; heavier bbs are good for you. But weaker airsoft guns, will need lighter bbs. If a strong airsoft gun shoots .12 bbs, the bbs will often be inaccurate and the distance is decreased.
 Many real optics can be mounted as well, though these tend to cost much more than the airsoft replica versions.
 They will in fact reach the target faster (because of the increased momentum, which helps to counter air resistance). Again, stay away from .12g BBs for any good gun. .12g BBs are also much more inaccurate than any of the other ammo types.
 Heavier rounds will have lower FPS at the barrel, but will reach the target faster, and will give you more effective range (FPS does not equal range!).
 You must be a part of your gun. Familiarization and skill with your weapons of choice is absolutely critical, and anything less will be that much more risk of you being on the losing end of things.
 4-8+ is generally a good group size for playing. This means you can play 2on2 or 4on4 etc. Never play in the public eye or in your backyard if easily visible to others. Also, do not play inside your own home!
