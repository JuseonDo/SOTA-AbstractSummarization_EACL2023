 A web search for 'wireless ethernet bridge' will turn up lots. Be sure to download and read the manual for the device, so you know what you'll be getting yourself into.
 Every device is different. Most come with some software. Most have a 'web page' interface to configure it without the software. Read the manual.
 If it's a switch, you're done. If it's a router, make sure it's plugged into the 'WAN' port.
 The DHCP on the wireless device will handle everything.
, into the router/switch.
, The default password isn't easy to remember, and all numeric, which makes it supremely weak against attack. Mine had the 'Manual' inside it, along with the web interface. Once the software for it was installed, setup was easy, if you are used to setting up Wi-Fi devices.;
, This was a LOT more difficult. The 'Wi-Fi Protected Setup' did not work. It didn't come with OS X software, and the 'Mac software' on their support site doesn't install. So I had to track down how to configure the web interface (Web Search: Installing WET610N using the Web-Based Setup Page). Connect it to the 'Hot Spot', and get the password RIGHT.
, In this case, a 'Time Capsule 2TB'. 'Connect Using': Ethernet. 'Connection Sharing':Off (Bridge Mode).]

, Configuring this way 'may' require you to change the settings back on the 'hot spot' when you hit the road and want to share the connection again. On the plus side, this will definitely work around any 'limits' the 'hot spot' has on number of active connections.
 They should all share the internet connection whenever the wireless hot spot is turned on and in range of it.
