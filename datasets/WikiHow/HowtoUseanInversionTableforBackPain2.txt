 Inversion therapy is rarely used to treat chronic pain, so it is only useful for mild relief. Anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, an exercise routine, epidural injections and even surgery may also be used to treat your condition.
 This will keep you from further injury or pain.
 Push back on the handles until you are horizontal. Stay there for one to two minutes to allow your blood flow to change before continuing.
 Breathe deeply and stay there for one to two minutes.
 You should feel comfortable that you are steady in the table before doing this.
 Try it twice per day to help your body grow accustomed more quickly.
, Inversion tables will only provide temporary relief, so you may need to do it more often to get a good benefit from it.


You do not need to do a full 90 degree inversion. Many people do not invert more than 60 degrees, and others use a 30 degree angle because it is more comfortable and you still see benefits.
 Choose the angle, time and number of repetitions per day that work best for your condition.
