 It should be about two to four inches. Buy some stickers and put them on the cover. Do not write anything like "My spy clues" or "My spy notebook" on the cover. This is the biggest mistake you could make! Instead, you could put "Homework Notes" or something boring that doesn't attract people like "Notes on How Garlic Day Came to Be".;
, It is nicer to get a small group (2-4 people) than a big group (5-10). Make sure they all have what they need.
 They could be passing on information to the enemy.You never want that to happen there could be consequences.
 Bring some extra lead if it is a mechanical pencil. Bring erasers and pencil sharpeners.

 Such as A=1 and B=2 C=3 and more.
 Get some lemon juice and put it in a bottle to use as ink. To activate the lemon juice ink, heat the paper gently, being careful not to scorch or burn the paper.
 Or after school at your house in a secret place.
 This could be your bedroom or a clubhouse.
 Hide them in a locked safe or a location that no one is likely to "happen upon". Make sure that you "cover your tracks" when storing or retrieving your spy notebook. That is, make sure no one is watching you so that suspicion might be aroused.
 You need to know what your fellow spies are doing and how.
 Use camouflage!

, Titles could be "the leader", "the brainiac", "the stealth" and "the jazz".
, This takes a lot of practice, inventiveness, preparation and rehearsing.
 They could be a double agent and be passing the information to the enemy.
