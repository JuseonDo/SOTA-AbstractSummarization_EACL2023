 It’s always advised to examine them by categories such as grouping them accordingly like dimes, nickels, pennies, etc. This will certainly make the work easier, quickly observing some differences of a coin to another if you evaluate them by groups. It is important not to get too hyped in the search, remember that if an error is too small then the value of the coin is not too much.;
, Look out for missing letters, any doubling, and anything out of the usual. Error coins get these abnormalities during the production process; usually dirt affects the polishing and stamping process resulting to coins different from the others. Look at the face of the coin on both sides in different angles to easily see errors.
 Finding errors like details with over-punches, re-punches and other doubling errors makes such coins valuable.
 Doubling may also occur and try to find cracks, blank areas and other missing elements. On portraits, check on the details like chin, mouth, ears and eyes, doubling often also occur on these areas. Rim of coins should also be inspected where abnormalities also sometimes occur.
 If the orientation of the coin is on the right side up at starting point, the orientation after the turn should also be on the right side up. If orientation changes, then the coin is considered valuable. The government takes great care when it comes to correct orientation to prevent error coins reaching circulation. This is why you should make it a habit to check orientation of coins every time you hold one with the simple over-the-top-turn technique.
 Look for missing reeds, seams, inconsistencies on lines, and other abnormalities. Don’t forget to check on edges that have lettering because doubling may also occur.
 Finding valuable coins becomes easier and faster in time because the eye gets used to spotting small errors with practice.
