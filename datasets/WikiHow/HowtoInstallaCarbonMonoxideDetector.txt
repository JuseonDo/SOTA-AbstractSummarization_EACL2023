 One is battery powered while the other is AC powered. Do some research on the best option for your home, office or wherever you may want to install it. It is quite important to stick to AC powered detectors if you realize you might have a problem remembering to change the batteries. You may also want to buy a detector whose alarm goes louder and faster as carbon monoxide levels increase.;
, Since carbon monoxide is less dense than air, it tends to rise. This makes the best location to be near the ceiling and away from fuel burning appliances. It should at least 15 feet (4.6Â m) away from heating and cooking appliances and humid areas. Care should also be taken to ensure that it is not covered by drapery, furniture or anything else. Recommendations by the consumer product safety commission (CPSC) are that the detector should be placed near your bedroom so that it wakes you up if it goes off. For multi-level apartments it is recommended that you place detectors on every floor.
 Battery powered units usually come with screws and anchors while AC powered units simply need to be plugged in.
 Mark the holes with a pencil dot.
 Care should be taken to make holes that are not larger than the provided screw anchors in order to achieve a perfect fit.
, In case your detector does not have a twist off base, place the screws into the anchors and screw then in without tightening. Make sure that they protrude enough to let the detector fit over them.
, this will also give you an opportunity to familiarize with the way it sounds.
 for the replacement of the batteries twice every year. You will also need to check the chemical that enables the detection process. It should be replenished periodically as well.
