 This step is very important because unfortunately, without the Stromboli, International Boli Day (IBD) can be a disaster!;
, International Boli Day is not nearly as fun if you have to celebrate it by yourself!

, Recommended Stromboli: Large* Pepperoni & Mozzarella with extra sauce on the side. *Note: One large should be ordered for every 2 friends!

, See the tips below for maximizing your drinking enjoyment. All Refills should adhere to these same tips!

,, Recommended adds: Parmesan Cheese, Oregano, Garlic Powder. Of course, only add these if you like them!

, This is important as it leads to much conversation and rivalry! See below for tips on how to choose the money piece.
, There should NEVER be leftovers!

, Check the Tips for a guideline on ratings but feel free to add your own rating system. Doing so will further enhance your experience and help internationalize IBD and what it means to you and your friends.
