 Nothing on this plastic piece is connected to the internal components so you don't have to worry about damaging anything except the plastic cover.
 If you have tools for something like this, feel free to use them. However, with the paper clip unfold it until the first bend, make sure it's straight., This is tricky, getting it just right to get the tray open is hard., This is likely the problem, but sometimes opening and closing the tray rapidly until it opens works as well., You can also keep it off; that particular Xbox does get hot inside.
