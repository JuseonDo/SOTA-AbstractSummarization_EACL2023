 Upon completion, the game will deposit your character in Hidden Leaf Village.
 A small frog named Gekomatsu with a purple scroll above his head will be waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs to the left., The frog will send your character on a mission to collect 500 chakra fragments., Most of the fragments will be within eyesight and relatively easy to find.

Speed up your mission by navigating to the training field to collect a total of 200 chakra fragments, then continue leaving and re-enter the training field to collect 200 more chakra fragments until you collect a total of 500 fragments.
 The frog will then send you on another mission to collect 5,000 additional chakra fragments., This process may take between 30 minutes to one hour, depending on your skill level.

Save time collecting chakra fragments by roaming around Hidden Leaf Village and returning to places from which you’ve already collected fragments. Chakra fragments will reappear within 30 to 60 seconds after being collected, or after you leave and re-enter a screen.
 The frog will instruct you to go to Hidden Cloud Village. You may need to initiate two or more conversations with the frog to receive instructions to go to Hidden Cloud Village., The woman will help you teleport to Hidden Cloud Village in exchange for 1,000 ryo.,, A purple chakra fragment will be lying on the ground at the battle site., The game will now load the story of EMS Sasuke., When your mission is complete, EMS Sasuke will be unlocked.
