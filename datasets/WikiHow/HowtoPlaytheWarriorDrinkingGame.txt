 You will need plenty of it depending on the amount of players, the more players you have the longer the game will last. A good estimate would be 5-6 beers per player.;
, That will be that player’s cup for the duration of the game and they will re use it many times.
 Keep the cups touching so that the ping-pong ball does not just bounce in-between the cups and off the table.
 This may not look like much but it will be refilled multiple times.
 This cup is a game changer and is sure to improve everyone’s mood.
 You can do this by age, birthday, or any way you please.
 Everyone will stand around the table in a circle with their cup in front of them on the table.
 Keeping players going fast and playing upbeat music will keep the game from becoming stale and players from getting bored.
 The ball must bounce on the table first; the shooter cannot just throw it directly into a cup.
 Remove the ball from your cup and get to chugging your half 8oz filled cup.
 You are encouraged to take your time here because you only have a limited number of tries.
 That is the first way to be eliminated from the game; that player will have to sit out until a new game begins.
 You should drink your drink as fast as possible and play as fast as you can because you are racing against all other players.
 This is the second way to be eliminated from the game. After you are kicked out of the game you can wait with the other eliminated players until a new game begins.
 The last man standing is the winner of the game and is allowed bragging rights of being “The Warrior”

, If you enjoyed our game you should play it again.
