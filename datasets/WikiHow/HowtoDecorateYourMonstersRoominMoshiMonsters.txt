To buy more rooms visit New Houses on Ooh La Lane. ( You must be a member);
, After you have decided, go and check out the shops to see if they have what you are looking for. (If you are a member you have the advantage to go any shop and have more choice.) Buy the wallpaper, windows, door and floor that have the same theme. ( e.g. if you want your room to look like the forest then buy a forest wallpaper, flower floor, wooden door and grassy window.),,, For example add bamboo and wood items if your house theme is a forest, or add bright and flashy items if your room theme is like a disco., That way you will move up the Monstar list and become more popular.
