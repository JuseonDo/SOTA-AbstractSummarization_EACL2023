 In the academic experiment, researchers hid behind a two way mirror. You can accomplish the same thing with a video camera or a webcam in your computer.;
, Explain that you are going to leave the room and that he/she is welcome to eat the marshmallow while you are gone. However, if you return and he/she hasn't eaten the marshmallow, you will reward him/her with an additional marshmallow.
, In the actual experiment, the psychologists waited up to 20 minutes to see if the children could resist the temptation. However, in this fun version of the test, most parents will prefer to only wait 2-5 minutes.
 Allow him/her to now eat both marshmallows. Explain that you are proud of him/her for being patient. If the child ate the marshmallow while you were gone, try to use the moment for teaching about delayed gratification.
 The kids will enjoy seeing their reaction regardless of how the test goes.
