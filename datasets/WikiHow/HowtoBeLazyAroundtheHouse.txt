 For extreme laziness, use a stool or chair that has rollers on the bottoms, so you can glide easily from the table to the sink, without even getting up or moving anything but your arms.;
, There are a few chores that can't be managed on your backside, for everything else hoover from the comfort of your office recliner,

,, The more they can see how happy these things make you, the more likely it is they will gladly do it again. You could say: "No one makes lasagna quite like you, it fills my heart full of wonder, and my taste buds feel like they are dancing on the wings of an angel."The essential rule with laziness is that flattery will get you everywhere!

, Spend most of this time doing nothing, but create plenty of mess. Come up with a set of fictional complications that have made it a much harder job than expected.
 When their backs are turned, simply kick back, and relax.
 Organize the jobs you are putting off into a hierarchy. If you need to both tidy your room, and complete a vital work assignment, always opt for the tidying first (even if you do just hide the mess). The satisfaction of completing an entire task will put your lazy mind at rest. The lesson here is to always leave the lengthiest jobs till last!

, Very subtly, try to sabotage their jobs. Drop a few crumbs after they have vacuumed. Sneak in a red sock when they help with someone else washing, and slyly dirty up their dishes the moment they have cleaned them. However, it is vital to never be caught on a sabotage mission.
 Gather in the living room, settle down with a film keeping snacks and drinks to hand.
