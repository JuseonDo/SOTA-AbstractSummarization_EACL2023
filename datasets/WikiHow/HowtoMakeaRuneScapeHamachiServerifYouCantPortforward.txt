if you look at the top row of your hamachi window, you will see a large ip address in white.

, They're good

, That will put your server online. Next, to find the IP for the server, bring up Hamachi. Once it is brought up, unless it auto-connects, click on the power button in the bottom left-hand corner of the window.(If you get errors, I will explain how to fix later.) Look for a triangle-like button towards the bottom right-hand corner. Click on it. It should bring up a pop-up window with 2 options. "Create a network" or "Join an existing network". Choose "Create a network" if you are making a server. If not, then select the latter to join another server. Now, just make a network name and password(use an easy one, so people don't accidentally misspell when trying to log into your network) Once the network is established, people can now join your server!

, That is your server IP. The port is 43594(unchangeable).
