 General Delivery (also known as "Poste Restante" in Europe) is a worldwide service offered by post offices to deliver mail to itinerant individuals who have no permanent address. To get mail on the road with General Delivery, have your mail addressed with your first and last name, care of "General Delivery" (or Poste Restante), c/o the post office address. Once it arrives, the postmaster will hold your mail for at least 30 days. In America this service is free but in other countries fees might be assessed.;
, For a fee, Escapees mail service will give you a Texas address to use for mail delivery. They will hold all mail that comes to you at that address until you call to have it sent to you somewhere. You can use General Delivery service for delivery, a private residence, hotel, campground or anywhere with an address. Other mail forwarding services exist in places such as UPS Stores and business service stores that offer photocopying, passports and other administrative services of this nature.
 This can be expensive, but it's faster than most mail solutions and it's available worldwide. You'll need to know the address of the UPS or FedEx store where you want your mail. To save money, have as much mail as possible delivered in one envelope to this location. Once it arrives, they will hold your package of mail until you pick it up. The advantage to using these companies is they are open later than the post office and oftentimes on weekends.
 Again, you can utilize General Delivery service when choosing this option. To make it easier for your friend or family member to help you, have your mail sent to their address and provide them with postage money and large envelopes before you depart on your journey. Once you have a significant bundle of mail collected and know your upcoming address, your friend or family member can send it in one package.
