 to 1/8 cord (looks like what you plug into the headphone jack of your CD player). You can probably get one at Radio Shack.;

On Audacity, select recording device as Stereo/Mono/Wav mixer.






Press Record, then quickly press Play on the streaming audio.






Once the streaming audio has played all the way through (or once you have all you want recorded), press Stop, on Audacity. Your streaming sound will be recorded.






Play the file (what you recorded) all the way through on Audacity, and if you like it, then press File, Export as WAV (if you want to save as MP3, you must download Lame Encoder first).






Just a little side note, if you're looking to add this to a program such as Windows Movie Maker, use the "Narration" tool.
