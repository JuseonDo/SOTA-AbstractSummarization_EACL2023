 You will be stamping the blossom onto this image. Leave to dry before proceeding.
 Or use a paper plate if you want to dispose of it rather than wash the paint off.
 Lift up and allow any loose paint to drip off before using.
 Simply press down the base of the bottle gently and lift up cleanly. You will see blossom imprinted where you have pressed––there should be five outer dots and possibly an inner circle dot too, depending on the pattern of your soda bottle.
 Try different styles, some with more blossom, some with less, until you get a picture that you like the most.
 The soda bottle can be turned into something else, like a candy dish or a volcano science project.
 Find a pretty place in your room to hang up the picture. If you're a teacher doing this with a class, have the children place them around the classroom as decorations to celebrate springtime.
