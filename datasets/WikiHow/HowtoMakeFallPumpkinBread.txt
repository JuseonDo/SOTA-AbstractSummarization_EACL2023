, Flouring a loaf pan ensures that your finished bread will release from the pan perfectly. Even nonstick pans needs to greased and floured. No crumb left behind!

, Whisking the dry ingredients thoroughly will produce a smooth, even batter.
 Use a hand mixer to combine the wet ingredients.
 Add 1/3 of your dry ingredients at a time to ensure the batter is well combined.
 If you would like, sprinkle roasted pumpkin seeds on top of the prepared pans. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
 Once ten minutes is up, remove the pumpkin bread from the baking pans and place on a cooling rack for another fifteen minutes.
 Enjoy!
