 That kind of popularity is unparalleled in history.;
, It's inspiring. Read each Beatles biography too, and maybe search for some interviews from cast members to see what tours were like.
 Their wit, sarcasm, and laugh-out-loud humour is impressive and endearing

, Check out the best artists/bands of all time list (#1 is the Beatles), best albums of all time list (Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is #1), and best songs of all time (songs by the Beatles are listed more times than those by any other artist/band)

, It is so varied, anyone is bound to find at least a few songs the like. And chances are, you'll like loads of it. Don't be discouraged if you don't like the first few songs you find. They're song book is so varied, it's almost guaranteed to happen. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Abbey Road, and Revolver are probably their most well-known.
 "Performing" the music may make you like it more.
 "Hey Jude" on the guitar is a great place to start, no matter how much guitar talent you have (there are only four different chords). Playing the music may give you a deeper appreciation for it.
