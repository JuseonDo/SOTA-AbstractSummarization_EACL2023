 First of all, decide what you think is your most beautiful feature, and find a dress that highlights it. If you really like your pretty blue eyes, pick a dress in a color that really makes them shine. If you are proud of your toned arms, pick a sleeveless dress, or if you have shapely legs, pick a dress with a slit. This will also help you be more confident, because you will be showing off what you like about yourself and therefore taking the attention away from the things you would like to improve.;
, You will just be uncomfortable and not able to breathe or bend the whole night. Remember, dress sizes don't really mean anything anyway. No one will ask you what size you are wearing, only you will know, and what does it matter? All stores run different. Go for a dress that fits your body and is comfortable, because you want to be able to dance the night away in comfort! You're much better off choosing a dress in a style that drapes, not form-fits. You'll be more comfortable and you'll look stunning! Just don't buy something obviously too big but still intended to be skintight- some areas will droop, exposing a few things that you might want to keep covered.
 Before you get dressed and made-up, eat something healthy and has carbs/proteins, like a turkey/tomato sandwich on rye bread. Why? It'll keep you from getting too nervous or jittery, as well as fill you so you don't have to eat most of the prom food (which is usually unhealthy in all the worst ways)

,, Because, if you think it- you will be!

, If they joke just ignore it or even better, take advantage of it... Joking could make you relax!

, If you're a curvy teen, then the fat will kind of slump out if you slouch. Shoulders back, too. If you have a big chest, wear a proper bra for the dress type- but always make sure it fulfills it's purpose. You want to look beautiful, not jiggly!

, Find a guy who you really like, but who likes you for you- not just your face or body. You don't want a date with a guy who will turn you down just because you're curvy like a goddess- would you want to be stuck with that guy for the rest of your life? Then don't go with him!

, This is a great night, but it won't be the 'best' night of your life unless you're having fun!
