 Do so by typing Ctrl+O (or ⌘ Command+O for Mac users) on the keyboard.;
, This can be done in one of two ways. The first option is to go to image>adjustments>hue/saturation (type in the shortcut Ctrl+U or ⌘ Command++U). Alternatively, you can just click on the "create adjustment layer" icon. For current purposes, the second option is ideal.
 And then click on Hue/Saturation.
 This may take a couple of seconds, depending on the computer performance speed.
 Drag the window by clicking and holding it as you move your mouse.
 The adjustment layer should be beside your image file. By moving the Hue slider, you will be able to see the gradual change of colors on your image.
 Drag the slider to the left for a lesser amount of color on the picture or for a duller gray image.
, Drag the slider to the left for a darker image; lightness adjusts the amount of black/white (in this case more black) on the image.
, Then play with the hue slider to look for the color you want to apply on your image.
 Paint over your image by unlinking and selecting the layer mask on your adjustment layer. Make sure also that the color you're using is black as you paint over the image and on the layer mask.
 You have learned the basics of how to adjust hues on an image using Photoshop.
