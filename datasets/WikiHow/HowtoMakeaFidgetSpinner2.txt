, Again, the latter is more favored. Depending on the type of spinner, you'll want to glue two or three metal nuts to the bearing.,

If you are using a regular bearing, put 2-3 glue spots on the bearing, maintaining an equal distance between the spots.
If you are using a sliding door roller, you need to put one of the nuts on the roller, hold it there, and fill the gap with glue. Do that with the rest of the nuts. Remember to maintain an equal distance between the spots.
