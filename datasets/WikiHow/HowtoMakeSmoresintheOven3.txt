 This will make cleaning up easier.
 How many you break depends on how many s'mores you want to make. One graham cracker is enough to make one s'more.
 Set the other graham cracker half aside for later. Depending on the size of your toaster oven, you may be able to make two s'mores at one time--just remember to leave some space between each cracker.
 Set it flat-side-down so that it does not roll off.
 Slide the tray into the toaster oven and shut the door. Allow the s'more to bake until the marshmallow turns a golden-brown color. This will take about 4 minutes., Once the marshmallow is toasted, take the s'more out of the toaster oven. Top it off with 2 to 4 squares of plain chocolate.
 Press down on the cracker enough to seal everything together but not so much that the cracker breaks.
 After about 1 minute, the chocolate will have softened to a gooey consistency. The marshmallow will also have cooled down enough to eat.
