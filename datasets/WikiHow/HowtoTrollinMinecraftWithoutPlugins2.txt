 Putting a block on top of a chest will prevent it from being opened.
 They will not inflict damage, but will worry your victim.
 Put some doors and a 2-tick timer and link them together. Then put a redstone torch there and quickly destroy it. If successful, the doors should rapidly open and close and make a door opening sound every 1/10 second.
 Surround their whole house, and, for an extra jumpscare, remove all of the torches!

, This will make the victim start to scavenge for their items, buying you time to set a trap or something.
