 They will agree as a whole that they face certain doom from the Super Mutants.;
, They will direct you to Germantown Police HQ.
 Bring along a combat shotgun and a Chinese officer's sword.
 Scrounge around for supplies, then rest outside in a tent before braving the building.
 You can pick the lock at the ground floor (Lockpicking skill 100) or use the upper level door on the right side.
 Use the combat shotgun when you are caught.
 Make sure all the Super Mutants on the ground floor are dead, then open the cell (Lockpicking skill 50).
 Ask her if she was alone. She will tell you about Shorty in the basement. Tell her to stay put, then proceed to the basement.
 Untie Shorty and meet up with Red.
 Fast travel back to Big Town.
 She will thank you, but mention that the Super Mutants will come back. Either offer to fight the Super Mutants for them, or repair a broken Sentry Bot for them (Repair skill 50).
