@summary
prepare the wire you will use.

@summary
cut the wire into 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) pieces.

@summary
twist each 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) strip into little figure 8's, or think of a "s" but keep in mind each end must be closed against the inside of the "s".

@summary
make your own "o"-shaped rings by coiling the wire around a thin rod or the tip of your pliers.

@summary
interlock your handmade "s" links by placing an "o" between them.

@summary
attach a clasp of your choice.

@summary
find the center of the chain, opposite the clasp, and attach any pendant you wish.
@article
 Using a polishing cloth, fold over the wire portion. Pull and stretch an 18" section, or more, of wire directly from the coil pack of your crafting wire.;
, Cut at least 30 such strips, depending upon your neck size. The finished necklace will measure about 18"-25", depending upon your "S" link count.



Before cutting all 30 pieces, cut one piece a little too long, measure it and bend. Measure how much extra there is once you've bent the piece and subtract that length from the original length to determine how long to cut the pieces.
 Alternatively, buy them from the craft shop.
 If you wish, check that all the "S" links point the same way, or alternate directions for a slightly different look. The photo shows the "S" links in alternate directions.



Create "O" ring and fish-hook type fastener for back of the neck. Or...
Purchase a barrel clasp, tube magnet closure, or other style at a craft shop. A toggle clasp is a great finish, as it is easy to open and close.
 Use another "O" ring or two if you need to, to get the pendant facing forward.
