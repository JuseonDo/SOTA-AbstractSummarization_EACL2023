consider naming the toy after a famous person you like.

think about a name you might have heard on tv.

 Or, if your stuffed animal reminds you of someone you know, you could name them after that person. This could even be a place you love going to, or a landmark or monument that is special for you.


Try naming it after a character in a movie.
 If you really like the name, why not name your toy that. If you play an instrument, maybe you could think of a song name you like and name your toy the name of the song.
