 If you can peel up one small portion of the veneer to see what’s underneath, you can get an idea of how much work the project will take. If the piece of veneered furniture has been stored in a damp place for a few years, chances are you can skip the loosening step and move straight on to scraping the veneer off.;
,, Squeeze it out so that it is damp and not dripping.
 Take extra care to ensure that the towel is not sitting directly on any pieces of finished wood that you want to leave intact. The water can damage the finish.


Any water damage to the wood just under the veneer can be removed during the sanding process.
 Re-moisten the towel if it won’t stay damp for that long. If the veneer doesn’t have any cracks, you may need to keep the towel on the surface for three hours., Look for curling and gaps in the surface. The glue under the veneer should start to dissolve with prolonged water exposure.
 Put on your safety gloves and glasses.
 Keep the putty knife as flat as possible to avoid damaging the wood underneath. Try to scrape with the grain of the wood underneath.
, Damaged veneer can come up in sheets.
 Flip your chisel over if you are using one. Work at the glued portion from the side, approximately 45 degrees off of the wood grain.


Use short, flat strokes and gentle pressure to lift the glued portion.
 Purchase an old iron that you can use for only home improvement projects. Wet an old towel and place it on the stubborn veneer.


The towel should be fairly damp, but not dripping.
Place the heated iron on top of the damp towel. Let it sit for one to two minutes. The steam should help loosen the glue on the veneer.
Be very careful that you don’t touch the iron or place your hands near the steam during this process. It is extremely hot.
Keep the iron and towel away from finished pieces of wood.,,, Plug it in and put on your safety glasses and ventilation mask.
 Brush off the dust.
, Finish it with a polyurethane sealer.
