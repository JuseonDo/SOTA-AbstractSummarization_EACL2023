 Rubbing alcohol is a nice DVD cleaner because it is not as strong as other solvents and evaporates quickly. Diluting it a bit with water creates an effective solution.;
, NEVER wipe in circles. Wipe in straight lines from the center rim to the outer rim, turning the disc as you clean from in to out.


Microfiber cloth has an extremely tight weave, and is made of synthetic fibers. It grabs a hold of dirt, dust, and other crud that may be making a home on your formerly spiffy DVD disc.
 Because the alcohol evaporates quickly, this shouldn't take long.
