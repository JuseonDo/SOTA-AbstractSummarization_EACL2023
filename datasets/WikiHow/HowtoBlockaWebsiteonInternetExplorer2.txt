 In older versions of Windows and Internet Explorer, the best way to block websites is to change the settings of the program itself.,, In the popup window, click on the "Content" tab, and then under "Content Advisor" click "Settings."


You may be asked to enter a password to prove you have administrator authority.
 This section will contain a list of sites that are both approved and specifically blocked.
 The box for entering the URL will appear under the words "Allow this website," but after entering the web address you can click on either "Always" or "Never." Click the latter option to block a website.
 If you are finished, click "OK" and close the window.
