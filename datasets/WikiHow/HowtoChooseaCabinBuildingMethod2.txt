 This option is very expensive, but does allow for the most customization of your cabin. You have the freedom to design the cabin exactly how you want, both on the interior and exterior.
 You can often expect delays that will push back your timeline, and cause your budget to run over. Delays can occur due to weather, waiting for materials, or even simple complications in the building process.
, Any time you have large work crews coming to a site the property gets torn up, and left a mess. The larger the project the larger the mess left behind. Also note that contractors are often permitted to bury a certain amount of the scrap from a work-site on your property, ask about that up front so you know what you can expect.
