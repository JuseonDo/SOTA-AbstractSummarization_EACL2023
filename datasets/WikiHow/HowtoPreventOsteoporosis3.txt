 There are some risk factors for developing osteoporosis that you can’t do anything about. Studies suggest that the following groups are at a higher risk for osteoporosis:Women, especially post-menopausal women or women who have had hysterectomies
White and Asian people
Short or small-framed people, especially thin people
People with a family history of osteoporosis
Older people

, You can take the steps in this article to affect many of these risk factors. People have a higher risk of osteoporosis if they:Have anorexia nervosa
Don’t get enough calcium and vitamin D
Have low estrogen and/or testosterone levels
Use certain medications, such as corticosteroids
Don’t get enough weight-bearing activity
Smoke
Drink too much alcohol

, Some medications, such as corticosteroids like prednisone, decrease your body’s absorption of calcium through the intestines.If you have other risk factors for osteoporosis, speak with your doctor to determine a safe dosage.


Taking the lowest possible dose for the shorted time will decrease inflammation without increasing your risk of osteoporosis as much.
If you must continue to take corticosteroids or are otherwise at high-risk for osteoporosis, ask your doctor about medications that can help treat or prevent osteoporosis. Medications include ibandronate (Boniva), alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate sodium (Actonel), and zoledronic acid (Reclast).Hormones including estrogen products may also reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis.
