@article
 If you don’t fall on your stomach and then flip over to do pushups, people will suspect you are actually clumsy instead of thinking you are an exercise junkie.;
, This step requires you to scan your area quickly. You don’t want to be on the ground motionless for an excessive amount of time. Otherwise, someone might call an ambulance.
 Make sure you get a really deep bend in the arms too. The number you do all depends on you, but 5 is the minimum. You can go ahead and do 10. However, if you really want to show the people around you how much of an exercise freak you are, the sky is the limit.
