@article
 Go to the Grand Exchange to buy one. It should cost less than 500gp.;

To do this, head west of Varrock. Before you reach the river that separates forest with the Barbarian Village, head north (alongside the east side of the river). You will see a small shack. Open the door and head underground.
Make sure you're on a world with 600 people or less. If not, then world hop.
 It isn't recommended to pick up anything else (unless the drop is uncommon or rare) as it takes up inventory space. The bones are worth a decent amount, and most players will pick them up.
 The price of your inventory will vary due to market trends.
 Repeat.
