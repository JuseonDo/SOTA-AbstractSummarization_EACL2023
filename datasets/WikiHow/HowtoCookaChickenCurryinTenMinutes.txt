 Just remember that the smaller something is, the faster it cooks. You'll want the garlic cloves, onion, and chili to be finely chopped.









If you want the curry to be less spicy, take out more chili seeds. You can always omit the chili if necessary or wanted.;
, Just be sure that you wash your hands after cutting the raw chicken before moving onto the next step.
 Cook them for about 5 to 7 minutes, so that the chicken is cooked thoroughly.
 Leave it on medium heat and keep stirring.
 Also, add the 2 tablespoons of double cream. Mix and cook everything together, then remove from the heat.
