Because campers depreciate so quickly, you can purchase a relatively newer model far cheaper than you can purchase a brand new one.
Inspecting the camper to make sure that the vehicle has no mechanical problems is key to a good purchase.
Purchasing a camper from a private-party seller can often be cheaper than buying off a new or used camper lot, BUT not always...most private party owners will owe money on their campers and will be upside down. So, compare deals that you can get private party with deals at your local dealer.;
,, The larger the town, the higher likelihood that you will find what you are looking for.



Search for a camper by type, make or location at http://www.rvt.com/.

The site http://www.rvtraderonline.com/ lets you look for vehicles being sold both by individuals as well as campers being sold by dealers.
Search on the internet for RV Dealers (insert your city here). Most dealers have websites.
 Your best bet, though, is to go to that location and drive the vehicle back home. This will allow you to test drive the vehicle before signing any agreement with the selling party.



Inspect the chassis for cracked tires, dents, brake line wear, fluid leaks, a properly-mounted hitch, a present spare tire that is in good condition, an up-to-date emissions test and lube points that look properly maintained.
Look at the roof for damage or leaks.
Check not only the interior of the vehicle but the engine as well.
 You want to make sure that there are no obvious issues such as oil leaks.
