 This means removing the green shell and silky bits.;
, Watch out for earwigs, which sometimes set up residence inside the corn.
 Sounds hot, right? It is but it's the perfect temperature for roasting corn.
 Ensure that there are no tears or holes.
 If you want softer corn, then put water in the pan, about 1 inch/2.5cm. The corn will absorb the water as it roasts.
, Rotating the corn within that time is a good idea, but not absolutely necessary.
 Enjoy the sweet taste of success!
