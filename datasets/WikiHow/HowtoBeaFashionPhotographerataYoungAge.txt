 Photography is needed in all areas of the fashion industry, and there are always people on the lookout for a decent photographer. Decide which path you would like to follow - stock photography, photography for fashion houses, magazines or galleries, photo journalism - the possibilities are endless.;
, Ask around in family circles for opportunities - many families like to have professional shoots so ask people whether they would like a photo session. Remember to focus on the fashion, not the person.
 You can't stuff a few polaroid snaps in an envelope if you want fashion photography to be your career.
, Many organizations hold fashion shows as fundraisers. Offer to photograph the models on the runway and let the fund raisers use your images to promote their cause, in the press or on line. You can use the best shots in your portfolio.
 If they don't run any courses that would benefit you, or you don't want to take a course, find out if there are fashion and design students at the college who would like their work photographed. Ask about the hairdressing and makeup artist students too. These students will be working on their portfolios, why not be the one to take the photos for it. Universities may also have students who could put your talents to use.
 You could learn from a professional photographer if you were able to be on set with them even if you spend time putting up lights, humping props around, lugging clothes about or fetching coffee!

,, They may want someone to take product shots of their range for their website.
 You can make suggestions, but don't force your opinion on them - the customer knows best!

, Once you have a portfolio, arrange an appointment with someone relevant in an agency, company or magazine. Treat it as a job interview.
