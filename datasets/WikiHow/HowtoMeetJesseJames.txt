 This is true for meeting Jesse James as well:;
,,,, While it would be difficult to duplicate Jesse's success and fame, there are some things you do that may help you relate:

, Jesse James' last wife was an exotic dancer, aka stripper. By dating a stripper you will have something in common.
 Jesse has many Tattoos including one on the palm of his hand that says; "Pay up sucker". You probably don't want to duplicate his ink, but Tattoos will give you something to talk about.
 Jesse has a fleet of vehicles and shows interest in all types of modified and powerful cars, trucks and motorcycles.
 Pick events where there are not likely to be huge crowds to increase your chances of making contact with him:

, Jesse and other celebrities have been seen at VW and Porsche events in LA, chatting with vehicle owners. The photo above shows Jesse and an average guy hanging out. Jesse doesn't seem to mind that he has a dirty shirt and dirty hands.
