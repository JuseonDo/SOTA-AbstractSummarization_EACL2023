, Some fish and their prices include: sharks sell for 15'000, stringfish for 15'000 and tuna for 7'000, dig up all crosses on the ground to get gyroids and fossils, shoot down any balloon presents you see, catch any bugs you come across,get foreign fruit by sending letters with presents to neighbours or go to a friends town to get fruit, plant these in your town and after 4 days it will be grown, shake it and keep burning them until you get a full town, every 3 days collect the fruit and sell it for up to 200'000 for a whole town of fruit, but there is no point collecting shells on the shore because they are not worth a lot.
 Save all the money gained at the bank.
