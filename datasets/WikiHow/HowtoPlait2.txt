 Have smooth hair for this hairstyle, so condition your hair when you wash it, then brush it out before you start.
 Using your hands or a hair pick, separate the top section of your hair at the crown of your head.
, Plait in a similar fashion to that described in the first section. However, when you cross a section over, incorporate more hair from that side, along with the section you cross.
