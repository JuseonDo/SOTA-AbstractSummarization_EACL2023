make sure your model of tamagotchi is a connection or connexion.

@summary
if you're only going to leave it for 10 hours or less, put it to sleep by changing the time.

 V1-V4.5 can use the pause mode to stop growth and allow the clock to run. (Hold down button A and press B. Repeat to unpause.) On V5, go to the TV icon and choose the Travel Channel. The Tamagotchi will be paused while it is traveling.
 You can also wake it up in the same way (unless it's a baby). That way it will carry on getting older without you looking after it.
