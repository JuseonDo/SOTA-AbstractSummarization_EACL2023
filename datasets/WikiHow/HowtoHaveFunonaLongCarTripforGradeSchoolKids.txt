 You want to be able to have plenty of ideas and games to keep yourself occupied.;

Include a pack of cheap crayons and a coloring/activity book to keep younger kids entertained. When you get into a car, give it to them, and enjoy the peace and quiet.
 Also, take a snack such as a sandwich and a water bottle.
 If your car has a DVD player in it, or you have a portable DVD player, bring lots of movies and favorite shows. Don't play them too loudly, the driver cannot be distracted; bring your ear buds.
, You can also make up a game and create rules for it as well. Having the ideas noted down will make it easier to remember when traveling in the car.
 Some good ideas are:


The alphabet game: Someone thinks of a category like "animals" then everyone takes turns thinking of an animal for each letter of the alphabet.
The license plate game.
Skittle safety: Every time you see a yellow car, shout skittles!
Mustang Bing-Bang: If you see a Mustang, any color, shout Mustang Bing-Bang!
Slug Bug: Every time you see a slug bug car hit your opponent lightly and say, "Slug bug" and the color of the car!

, Especially if it is a long car trip, you may become very sleepy during the time your parents are driving.
 It will give you someone to talk to. If you're feeling really bored, make a book for it.
 Arrive in good spirits and ready to have a laugh. Don't complain about how long the drive was; you are blessed to be able to travel this way at this time of human history.
