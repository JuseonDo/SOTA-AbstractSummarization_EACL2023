 Prior to using any stain removal product on fabric it is a good idea to make sure that you won't bleach or discolor the fabric with the stain remover. The inner waistband or a rolled cuff are good places to test that aren't seen by others.
 Depending on the type of ink that you are removing from your jeans different stain removers may have more success. One of these stain removers should help get the ink out of your jeans:









Rub on stain sticks
Spray on pre-wash stain removers
Oxygen bleach cleaners

, Read the label directions on your stain remover and wait the designated time prior to washing the jeans according to the care instructions on the label.
