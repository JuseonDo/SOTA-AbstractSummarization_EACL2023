 This is always a good idea before apply any colored nail polishes or products. Choose one that contains nail strengthening ingredients if you wish., Brush it on all of your fingers and thumb nails. Try to a smooth, even coat of polish on., This can achieve a kind of snowy-white effect., It might be easier to use a nail-polish striper instead of a regular polish brush.

If you don't have one, then dip a toothpick in the bottle, and gently glide your hand on the nail without applying pressure.
