 If you already have a pie crust made (or bought from the store), click here to learn how to make the pumpkin-cheesecake filling., Pour the graham cracker crumbs into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar. Stir the two together with a rubber spatula until the sugar and crumbs are evenly combined.

Make sure that the graham crackers are finely-ground; they should resemble coarse crumbs.
 If you have not yet done so, melt the butter in the microwave or in a saucepan over the stove. Pour it into the graham cracker mixture, then stir it in with a rubber spatula., Do not grease the pie plate beforehand., Because the crust does not contain any flour or eggs, it does not need to be baked. Baking it, however, will make your cheesecake more like a pie., Do not take the crust out of the pie pan.
, Place the cream cheese into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar and vanilla extract. Beat everything together until the texture is smooth. You can do this by hand or with an electric mixer., Keep blending until the eggs are all mixed in, and not streaks of egg yolk remain., Set the crust aside, and keep the rest of the batter in your mixing bowl., Make sure that you are using 100% pure pumpkin purée and not the canned pumpkin pie type; the latter has too many added ingredients, which will affect the taste of your recipe., To prevent disrupting the bottom layer too much, gently drop spoonfuls of the pumpkin batter into the pie crust until the cheesecake layer is no longer visible. Use the back of a spoon to smooth the top of the pie crust down., It is ready when the center is almost set. Don't worry if the cheesecake still looks raw and gooey; it will continue to set up over the next few hours., Take the cheesecake out of the oven, then refrigerate it for at least 3 hours., It tastes great with some whipped cream. You can also garnish it further with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
