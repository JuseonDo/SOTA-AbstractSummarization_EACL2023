 The easiest way to see all of your installed apps and quickly remove the ones you don't want is to use the Charms bar. You can open the Charms bar by swiping in from the right side of the screen, or by moving your mouse to the upper-right corner.


You can also uninstall apps by long-pressing or right-clicking their icons in the Start screen and selecting "Uninstall".
 This will open a new screen.
 This will display a list of all the apps you have installed from the Windows Store. You can even remove apps that came pre-installed, such as Music or Travel.
, The app will be uninstalled immediately.


This will delete any data that the app has stored, so make sure to backup any important data.
