 This is a gray app that contains gears (⚙️) and is typically located on the home screen.
 It's about a third of the way down the "Settings" page.
 It's at the top of the "Contacts" page.
 It's in the "Accounts" section of the menu.
 It will turn green, and your Gmail contacts will now sync with your iPhone.
