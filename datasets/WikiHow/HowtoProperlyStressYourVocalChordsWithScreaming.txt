@summary
you should know what your voice range is (baritone, tenor, contralto, mezzo soprano, etc).

@summary
warm up.

@summary
when you first start learning, you're going to be making a lot of dodgy noises.

@summary
use your diaphragm correctly!,

@summary
when you are first learning to scream and do not know how to use your diaphragm, flex your abdominals, kind of like you're about to take a punch.

@summary
all you have to do from there, is repeatedly (over the course of many weeks), raise and lower pitch.

@summary
the more air you push out, the higher in pitch your screams will be.

@summary
it is most likely that it will hurt at first, but after a while you will learn how to do this correctly.

@summary
to attain a different pitch use your diaphragm, tongue position and the shape of your mouth... lows for eg - lower your tongue open your mouth wide.

@summary
for future reference, in most of the music that you might be trying to imitate, they use distortion effects in the studio or auto tune to make a deeper and fuller pitch.

@summary
it's just as bad for you as exhale screaming (if done improperly).

 If you don't already know, then search for info on the different voice ranges. Find an instrument you can sing along to, such as a guitar or piano, find middle C (256 Hz), and figure out what range you fit in to.
 Every good metal screamer does a warm-up at some time of the day before a performance. This is not a screaming warm-up, it's a singing warm-up. People like Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, Byron Davis of God Forbid, and Phil Labonte of All That Remains, all practice conventional singing warm-up exercises before a performance; the same fundamental exercises that you would do before choir practice. This is very important for your voice so don't be lazy and skip it. Find a singing warm-up routine, like singing the vowels--Eh, Ee, Ah, Oh, Oo--over a 5-note scale.
 Like little cat growls and trying to speak like Marge Simpson. It's important that you create your scratchy sounds from the nasal region in the back, above your throat, not low in your throat. If you make the sound from low in your throat, you will be teaching yourself to do it wrong and learning a method that will hurt you. Try to feel the difference between the Marge voice and the low-in-the-throat, gargle-like noise. You should be able to create the Marge voice without hurting yourself. Use these two points of reference as you're learning. Remember to keep your scratchy sounds coming from higher up (the nasal region) so you don't damage your voice. If you're doing it wrong, it will hurt. Practice intelligently. You will probably be screaming wrong in the beginning, so save your voice until you figure out how to do it right.
 Don't hold the air in your chest! You should breath in and fill your stomach, not your chest.
 After you do that, talk a little bit, if you get a raspy sound coming out, you are talking correctly.
 Also after a long time of practice as to where you can get different pitches, try pushing out more air.
 When performing high exhale screams, open your mouth as wide as possible and scream while flexing the diaphragm.
 If, however, it continues to hurt and/or bleeds, you are doing it wrong.
 For highs, raise your tongue high and allow the scream to hit the top of your throat.
, If you master both, alternating can give different vocal chords a chance to rest.
