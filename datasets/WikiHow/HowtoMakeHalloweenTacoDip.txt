 To do this, let it stay out on the kitchen counter or put it in the microwave, in a plastic bowl, for a few seconds, just enough to soften it. You don’t want to melt the cream cheese, just soften enough to make the mixing process easier when you add other things later on.
 Make sure the pieces are very small, about 0.5 cm long or smaller. When the vegetables are cut, check on the cream cheese to see if it’s soft enough. You may have to wait a few more minutes for the cream cheese to be ready.
 Mix thoroughly. This will help break down the cream cheese, making it easier to mix. It also makes the dip creamier.
, Make sure you cover the whole plate.
 Make sure the vegetables doesn’t pass more than 2-3 inches long, because you will be drawing in the middle of the dip and you want a flat surface to work on.
 Don't blanket the top with cheese; just add enough so you can still see some of the vegetables underneath.
 of sour cream in the Ziploc bag and seal it. Cut a small corner off the bottom of the plastic bag. Add more sour cream if needed. You will use the bagged cream cheese as a piping bag for the spider web.,,, Enjoy!
