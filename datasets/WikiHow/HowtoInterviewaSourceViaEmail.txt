, Since your source must complete some work by typing answers to your questions, you are asking quite a lot of your source. Do not burden him or her with too many questions, because he may decide the interview is too much trouble.
 Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." Your questions should be written concisely and clearly so your source immediately understands exactly what you are asking.
 The reminder should not be pushy; it should be friendly and act as a gentle impetus for your source to reply soon.
 Don't interpret your source's statements or use quotations out of context. If you have any questions about your source's intent or his answers, call or email him to clear up your questions.

Send an email or a brief letter through the mail to let your source know that you appreciate her help and the time spent helping you with your assignment. Within the note, indicate when or where her interview or the article to which she contributed to will appear.
