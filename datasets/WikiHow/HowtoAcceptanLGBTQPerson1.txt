 This is not something they chose, but rather is a part of who they are. They can't help it and you being mad will also not change it.;
, It takes a lot of courage to make such a revelation and the fact that they are telling you now means that they trust and respect you! It's possible that they just realized this about themselves, or it's possible that they were just not ready to tell you.
