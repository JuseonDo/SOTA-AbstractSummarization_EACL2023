 Make working out as important to you as everything else and literally write it into your day planner so you see it all the time. When you do this, your health and fitness plan will stay in place.;
, By going when the gym is less crowded, you’ll be more relaxed about keeping to your routine.
 You’ll come out of your exercising hurting and aching more than you should, and that can make you dread going back. Your health and fitness plan should start out with a workout of about 20 minutes to an hour at most with a mixed bag of exercises to keep it interesting. Plus, don’t forget to stretch before starting the exercises after warming up first.
 You’ll find that by setting and reaching attainable goals, you won’t give up on your health and fitness routine.
 Include what you are eating so you can see what works, and what doesn’t work for you. This allows you to adjust your workout accordingly and you can focus on problem areas.
 Do aerobics one day, the treadmill another. Even participating in sports can be counted towards your health and fitness routine. Try to change your weight routine as well by adding a rep, weight, or set every three to four weeks.
 This provides you with some social interaction, a little bit of friendly competition, and encouragement when you really just feel like giving up.
 Start by developing your health and fitness routine with them to actually working out with them watching you and encouraging you to keep on going. They will be able to help you adjust your routine if needed.
 It takes that long to see results sometimes and if you keep that firmly in your mind, you’ll be more inclined to stick with it.
 This is when most people drop their health and fitness routines for good. You’ll soon find that you actually miss going to the gym, so just go back as soon as possible and keep going.
