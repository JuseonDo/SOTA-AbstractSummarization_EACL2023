 The most obvious feeling is pain radiating from your back, even when you don’t move it. Additionally, when you stretch or bend your back, you might hear a grinding or crunching sound. This is common in the neck, especially. You might also feel a pinch or tingling feeling along your spine caused by the spinal cord irritating the nerves in your back., Swelling might be visible along your spine or certain back muscles.
 If you feel that you’re dealing with back pain every day or nearly every day for any extended period of time, consult a physician.Don’t ignore chronic pain. Take proactive steps to deal with it sooner rather than later. It will likely not go away on its own.
