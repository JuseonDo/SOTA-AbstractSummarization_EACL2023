@article
 A standard needle or pin will be too weak to pierce through the firm plastic of the cap.

;
, Instead of a string, you can use a rigid line of plastic cut from a straw or plastic bottle. The important thing is that it is secured on the inside of the cap so that on the outside, the loop fits snugly on your finger like a ring., (Diameter is the length of a line from one edge of the circle to the other, and this line must pass through the center point.), Secure it in the beginning, but do not secure it at the end yet., You can then tie the thread into a knot. This is the cushion., Use plenty of glue to make sure it stays in place,
