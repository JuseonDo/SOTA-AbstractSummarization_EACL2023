 Since all of the faces of a cube are congruent, we can just find the area of one face and multiply it by 6 to get the total surface area. The surface area can be found by using a simple formula: 6 x s2, where "s" represents a side of the cube., To find the are of one side of the cube, you need to find "s," which represents the side length of a cube, and then find s2. This really means that you'll be multiplying the length of the cube's side times its width to find its area -- the length and width of a cube's side just happen to be the same. If one side of the cube, or "s," is equal to 4 centimeter (1.6Â in), then the area of the side of the cube is (4 cm)2, or 16 cm2. Remember to state your answer in square units.
 Now that you've found the area of one side of the cube, all you have to do to find the surface area is to multiply this number by 6. 16 cm2 x 6 = 96 cm2. The surface area of the cube is 96 cm2.
