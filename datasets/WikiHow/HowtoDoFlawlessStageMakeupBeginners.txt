 Keep it in your skin tone. This step is pretty simple. Use a mineral powder for a flawless finish, the top it off with setting powder.;
, The stage lights will drown out you complexion, so a nice rosy cheek is important. Brush it on to the apples of your cheeks like you would normally.
 Depending on character, eyeshadow will vary greatly. Check with your director for what is appropriate.
 Don't be afraid to really make it dramatic, because definition is the name of the game in stage makeup.
 If your character doesn't exactly have rainbow lashes, use a set of plain falsies for a voluptuous look

, Like the face, stage lights will drown out the lip's natural color. Stains work well too, but you might not want to stain your lips a jarring red if you're not in favor of wearing it all day. Save the stain for days where you have back to back shows.
 This will give directors a chance to see your look and give you some tips. In theatre, the director's word is the Bible.
