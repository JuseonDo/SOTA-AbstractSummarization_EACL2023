 You will be folding and then ironing material for your bag so have the iron ready to go.;
, You will need to cut out three pieces that will be fashioned together.


Cut out 2 pieces that are 17 ½ inches by 14 inches (this will be your bag).
Cut out 1 piece that is 12 inches by 8 inches (for the bag pocket).
Cut out 1 piece that is 22 inches by 4 inches (which will be the bag’s strap).
 Keep the back of the material with the folded piece down.
 Then sew the seams using the sewing machine.
 Then sew the seams in a similar fashion to the bag.
 Lay it toward the bottom, right above the seam. Sew the pocket into place by running the machine down one side, along the bottom and up the other side.
 Sew the bottom and both sides of the bag. Keep the seam even along the perimeter of the bag.
 Cut pieces to complement or enhance the bag pattern. The pieces will go on the top and bottom to form your clutch.


Pieces should be located at the top of the bag piece and the top of the pocket piece.
 Be careful to sew the pocket piece to the top area only (and not through the bag, which would cut off the pocket).
 Sew a small seam along the side and then turn the strap piece right side out.
 Leave enough material so that the handle is secured nicely inside, but be sure you don’t sew it too far down so that it isn’t functional.
 The bag is now ready for use.
