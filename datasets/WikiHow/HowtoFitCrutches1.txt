 Your shoes should have low heels and good support. In fitting, try to use the same shoes you'd ordinarily use walking around, or ones you anticipate using with crutches.;
,, This is where many people get things wrong, thinking that the crutch pad should sit right beneath the armpit. In fact, there should be enough space so that the crutch pad doesn't touch the armpit unless the user leans down slightly. Crutches are designed to get support from the arms and ribcage, not from the shoulders.


If your crutches don't have notches to perfectly accommodate the two inch gap between armpit and pad, opt for the lower setting instead of the higher setting. Higher-set crutches may have a higher likelihood of dislocating the shoulder. This will also stop you from leaning on your crutches when you don't have to.
 With your hands hanging relaxed at your sides and standing upright, the crutches' handgrips should be level with your wrist crease.
 Crutches are meant to deliver additional support to ailing legs and, as such, can be used more or less properly. Accommodations, however, may be made in order to help the subject feel comfortable.
