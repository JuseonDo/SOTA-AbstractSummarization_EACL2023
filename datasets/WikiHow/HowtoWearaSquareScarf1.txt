 Lay the square scarf flat out on the floor or on a table in front of you.


Fold it in half diagonally, so that it forms a triangle. It does not have to be absolutely perfect.;
, You'll be holding the two smaller angles of the triangle.


You may want to twist the ends to make them stay how they are and look more tapered.
 Bring the two ends round to the back of your neck.


Swap them over, so that your left hand is now holding the right end and your right hand is holding the left end.
 They should rest on your chest along with the front of the scarf.


It should hang in a triangular shape, with the two ends tapering off either side. If the scarf is too tight around your neck, simply grasp it at the front and gently pull it a little looser.
Place the knot as high or low on your chest as you like.
Remember, the scarf should be relaxed and comfortable to wear.
