 Let's face it, people judge you. You can try to get to a healthy weight for your age, just check online or ask your mom. But don't get Super skinny, or else you'll be labeled as "anorexic".;
, If you aren't one who has much money, try going to a consignment shop. Some brands that are usually a ticket into popularity are Urban Outfitters, Forever 21, American Eagle, Hollister, Brandy Melville and so much more.
 Bite your nails? Chew your hair? Stop; people will think you are disgusting.
 Usually the salon will have magazines for you to look at, so find one that you like and think suits you. But if you like your hair the way it is, get a trim. It makes your hair look healthier, sparkier, and prettier.
 Take the money you have saved up and go to different stores. Target and Kohl's usually have cheap, stylish clothes. You can also look on the sale rack at Abercrombie or Hollister if you'd like. You can shop for school supplies at Office Max, CVS, Meijer, and Target. Meijer and Target are probably the best if you dislike the plain stuff. If your new school allows it, you can buy makeup and nail polish, too.
 It might be a TV Show, a popular movie, hit song, or even bestselling book. Read newspapers, magazines, blogs, watch TV, listen to music, rent a movie, all that good stuff to get conversation starters.
,,,, You're going to a new school that may or may not be similar to your old one, not a prison. You're bound to find someone who is willing to be your friend.
 Nothing creates a bad first impression more than this, on both your teachers and classmates.
 If he or she wants you to tell something about yourself, briefly outline your life.
 This get everyone to like you, not just one group.
 Doing this will help you to find people who have similar interests.
,, By doing this you will strengthen your friendship.
 They'll get a chance to see pics of you and your old friends.
, You've made it.
