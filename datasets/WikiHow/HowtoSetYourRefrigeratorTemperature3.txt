 You may see a series of numbers along the top or bottom of the sliding switch. "1" is usually the coldest available setting, while the highest number is the warmest available setting.
 Or move the switch 1 number to the right if your refrigerator temperature is too cold.
 If the temperature is where you want it to be, then the slide is positioned correctly. If the temperature is still off, move the dial an additional notch to the left or right until you have a good internal temperature for your refrigerator.
 You'll always know where to reset the switch if it gets bumped out of position.
