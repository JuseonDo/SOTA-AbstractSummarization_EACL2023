nail each shelf platform for every step or rung of the ladder.

 Do both length and a desired shelf width. These measurements will be used to make a shelf platform which you will mount on the steps.
, Cut out any sections needed to help the shelf platform slide onto the rung with ease. As you can see here, special cuts were required at the back of the shelf platform.
 You may wish to nail at an angle that will counteract the lean the ladder shelf will have when placed against the wall. You'll want the books, objects, etc., to stay in place and not slide off.
