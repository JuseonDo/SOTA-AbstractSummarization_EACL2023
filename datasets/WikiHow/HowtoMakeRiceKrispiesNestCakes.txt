 Get out a jug, a mixing bowl, bun cases, bun-case trays and put the cooker on. Put the jug on the cooker to warm.
 Scrape together as many bars of Cadbury's Dairy Milk Chocolate as possible and break them all into little squares. Drop all the little squares into the bowl, and get out a metal spoon. Start mixing. Wait until all the chocolate has melted before proceeding to the next step., Pour as many as you need into your big mixing bowl., Get a wooden spoon and stir all the chocolate into the Rice Krispies (or cornflakes). Stir until every last little piece of cereal is coated in a thick layer of rich, creamy chocolate., For this, get two clean metal teaspoons. Fill the bun-case trays with bun-cases, and use one metal teaspoon to scoop the chocolatey Rice Krispies or Cornflakes onto the spoon. Use the other metal teaspoon to scrape them into the bun-cases., When each bun-case is full, you can get creative! You can use chocolate buttons, mini eggs, nuts, gummy mix - anything! - to decorate your Rice Krispie or Cornflake cakes! If you want an Easter look, use three mini eggs to make it look like eggs waiting to hatch, or you could perch an Easter chocolate bunny on top! Just be creative, artistic and let your imagination flow!, Enjoy eating your cakes!
