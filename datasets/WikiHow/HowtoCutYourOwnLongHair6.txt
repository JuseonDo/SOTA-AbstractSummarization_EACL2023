 This is particularly important to do before you start cutting, especially if you have frizzy hair. This is a dry cut so there is no need to wash your hair, unless it is dirty/oily.


This cut is good if you want more layers framing your face.
, With your head still upside down, brush your hair forward and gather it into a nice tight, secure ponytail that starts right on your hairline in the centre of your forehead.


Think unicorn horn.
 Are you going for a fringe that ends at your eyebrows or layers that start at your chin? Measure the distance of where your ponytail starts on your forehead to where you want your first layer of hair to fall.


You can measure this distance with a comb.
 Get your scissors and then shear your ponytail off at the length you measured with the comb.
 Change your grip on the scissors now and, pointing them directly into the hair, snip into the blunt end of the ponytail until it looks like a shaving brush: all graduated and fluffy, with no hard lines.


Take care to lean forward as you do this so you don't jab the scissors towards your eyes or get bits of chopped hair falling into your eyes.
