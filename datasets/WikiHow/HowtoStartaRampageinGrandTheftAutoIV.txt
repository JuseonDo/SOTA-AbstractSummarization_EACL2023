 You can either attain them from underground gun shops, cheat codes (if you are a cheater), Little Jacob's gun van, or pickups across Liberty City. Before you start, make sure you have full health and full body armor, too!;
, The best place to begin is at Playboy X's loft and start sniping NPC's. The loft can be obtained after killing Playboy during the mission The Holland Play. You can also grab a car and run over lots and lots of pedestrians. This will earn you one or two stars.
 This will instantly earn you a three star wanted level, in which choppers will start coming. Focus where the sirens are coming from when you hear them. You might even hear gun shots!

, Try not to waste RPG rockets (since the limit is 8). Try to use the sniper rifle and kill the pilot if necessary.
 That will make the police more angrier!
