 The block should be smaller then the paper you are using by an inch on all sides. Save scarp piece to practice carving on.;
, If there are any small imperfections use the sandpaper to smooth them out.
, Rub the back of the paper with the design on it with chalk. Then lay the paper chalk side down on the block. Then trace the design. Your design will be reversed on the final print so if you do any writing you need to trace and carve the letter backwards so the appear correctly in the print.
