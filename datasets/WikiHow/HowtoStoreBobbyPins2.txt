 While this could be a new one, it might be more fun to rummage through a few antique stores or flea markets to find a vintage one with a lovely design on it. Just be sure that whatever you use, you're happy to glue magnets onto it., Glue one each side of the little pin dish. Use glue suited to ceramics. Allow to fully dry., You'll find that the bobby pins gravitate to the magnet areas, forming pretty patterns. When you tip the dish upside down or accidentally knock it, the bobby pins will stay intact.
