 Formatting the hard drive erases everything on the computer, including Windows. You’ll need an installation disc to reinstall the operating system after you format the drive. You can borrow one from a friend, as long as it’s the same version you have installed currently.
 The only way to completely wipe your hard drive clean is to use a third-party “nuke” tool. Experts recommend DBAN, which is free.This will download an ISO image of DBAN to your computer.
 See Burn ISO Files to DVD for tips on properly burning an ISO file to disc.
,, This process will take several hours. The actual length depends on hard disk size and speed. Look at the “Remaining” time in the top right corner of the screen to keep track of your progress.
 Your drive has been erased and re-written.
 Now you’ll begin the process of installing Windows on your freshly-formatted hard drive. Rebooting the computer will boot directly into the Windows installer. Click “Install” or “Next” to begin the installation, then follow the screens to select your installation options.
