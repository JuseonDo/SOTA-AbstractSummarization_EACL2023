, If the box has spawned near you like in front of the lighthouse or near the power room, open those doors and use that first.
 Presuming you have already bought a Quick Revive, You will need Juggernog to hold onto your current Quick Revive for a little longer, and to protect you from those double swiping zombies bastards.
, Don't try to worry about ammo, but be careful not to kill the crawler as if you do, a new round will start and you may not have enough ammo to survive or you may not have enough to kill George afterwards.
 Remember: when the blue light on George flickers orange, he's about halfway dead, and when it stays orange he is about to die.
