 Your knees are upright. The head is on the earth. Pound your fists on the ground and stomp your anger alternately with your feet in the ground. Solve all the pent-up anger. To whom or what are you angry today?;
, Work all your stress and aggressions out. Focus on your body. Lift the butt while knocking so much in the air, that you resolve the tensions in the upper body.
 The shoulders and the head rest on the floor. Make large circles with your pelvis in the air. First ten times left and then ten times right around. Visualize water and think the mantra "Water".
 Breathe one minute relaxed into the body.
 Stretch your arms to the sky. Breathe in. Then bow before you and put the hands on the floor. Breathe out. Do this exercise several times and count the numbers 1 to 20 in the body.
 May all people be happy. May the world be happy." Then think the mantra "Light" and send light a) to your friends b) to your enemies c) to yourself. Massage the light into your body.
 The back is straight and the belly relaxed. Stop one minute every thought. Then remain in meditation, thoughts can come and go as they please. All feelings of anger, fear and grief appear and dissolve by themselves.
