 You will need a clean uniform and a lot of stationary. Remember pens, pencils, erasers, rulers, colouring equipment, protractor, circle compass, a bag, and a pencil case.;
, This will only be for a week, but have a shower everyday and wash and condition your hair. Have a bath the day before to relax your muscles.
 You don't want to fall asleep on the first day back at school!

, Even after a week you will see your skin starting to glow! During the holidays, you're more likely to be snacking on sugary sweets. Remember to eat sensibly and in good amounts.
 Do some swimming or ride a bike. That way, your brain will be detoxified and rid of all the sugar and forgetfulness.
 Practice times tables and handwriting. Try writing a story and add a chapter everyday. This way, you will focus on handwriting and vocabulary.
 You will see most of them at school and then they might see how beautiful you will look!

, Set your alarm and go to bed very early so you get a good night's sleep.
, You don't want to go to school in your pajamas! Wear a dressing gown to make sure you keep your uniform clean and you don't have any food or toothpaste on it.
 Keep your energy up until you have a snack at break time/recess.
 Make them shiny and bright!

, If your school doesn't allow make-up, wear some tinted moisturizer and some mascara. Keep it as natural as possible.
