 The list of jurisdictions allowing same-sex unions are the District of Columbia, Maine, New Jersey, Washington State, Hawaii(which they call "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationships")Vermont, California, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Oregon. Massachusetts is the only state that offers same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage was legalized in 2004 in Massachusetts, and on August 31, 2007 in Iowa. Until further court review, Iowa does not permit same sex marriage.;
, Online applications can be found also.
 There are usually two grounds for the dissolution of civil unions, which may vary by local law. They are as follows: (1) the union is irretrievably broken or (2) one of the parties is mentally incompetent.
 Both parties must live in the state where the union was established.
, This can be done through your legal representation.
 Try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but understand both legal parties may need to be involved. The final decision will be made by the court.
 If you and your partner have adopted or natural-birth children, discuss where the child will reside and an appropriate visitation schedule. Legal parties may need to be involved. The final decision will be made by the court. The Alliance Defense Fund can be of help especially if children are involved.
 Often the dissolution of civil unions involves complex situations and facts that can influence the courts decision about financial responsibilities, property, assets and children.
