, He'll give you an Eevee he can't look after.
 If you look at the prizes that the man in the little rune next to the Game Corner says, you'll see that an Eevee is one of the prizes. Earn enough coins to buy an Eevee.
 This will take a while, since you have to earn all the coins.
 A quick way to do this is bike back and forth from the daycare into the city. This can be boring, so watch television or listen to music. The daycare man will call you whenever an egg appears, and the eggs will hatch.
