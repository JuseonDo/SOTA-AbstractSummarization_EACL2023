 If you are using different colors, then layer the trash bags so that the colors are alternating if you like or keep the colors together.
 Cut off the top 1" or so of the trash bag where the drawstring is. Discard this material.
 Fold the trash bags so that the tops and bottoms are lined up. Try to get all of the layers as even as possible.
 Cut the bags along the fold you just made so that you have a pile of 20 trash bag squares. Cut carefully and try not to leave any jagged edges.
 Start cutting from the edge into the center from the side you just cut. Cut slits in the bags every 1







, Gather the bags at the center, like holding a bunch of dry pasta, so that your fingers are around the uncut center and the strips you made are hanging. Secure the center by wrapping a bit of tape (electrical tape works best) around the uncut portion of the bags.
 Next, take the individual strips and begin to separate each piece of plastic. This will give the pom pom its volume. Crinkle the strips of plastic once they're pulled apart to make it even fuller.








Your pom pom is ready to use! Make another so you have a matching pair.
