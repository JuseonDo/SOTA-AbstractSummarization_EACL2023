 They are expensive but not only do they organize your equipment, they protect your equipment. Choose one that fits the needs of your camera and the number of lenses you carry.
  Your camera bag will have padded compartments for your camera and several lenses.  It will also contain many zipper and snap pockets of varying sizes.,  If you keep a lens on the camera make sure the lens has a cover.  If you take the lens off make sure the lens area of the camera is covered.  Do not leave this area uncovered.  This is the most valuable part of your camera and dust and bits of sand and dirt can easily damage it.  ,, If not, you can usually fit it in one of the larger zip pockets of the camera bag.  , You may wish to organize your sd cards in a little sd pouch for easy access and ensure that you do not lose them because they are very small.,,, and money in a pocket or hook an i.d. keychain on your camera bag strap next to you.,, so when you look at your bag you should see your camera and your lenses only instead of personal items.,
