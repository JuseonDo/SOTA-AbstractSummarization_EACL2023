 Try to use 99% rubbing alcohol instead of the regular 70%, as it will kill more germs., This will give the hand sanitizer that gel-like texture. It will also take away some of the harshness of the rubbing alcohol and make it less drying by moisturizing your hands.
 You can use any scent you'd like, but the following scents have antimicrobial properties: cinnamon, clove, eucalyptus, lavender, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, or thieves., There should be no lumps or clumps.
 Try to use a bottle with a pump or squeeze top. Take the cap off and insert the funnel. Pour the mixture through the funnel and into the bottle. Use the spatula to scrape everything out of the bowl.
 Your scented hand sanitizer is now ready to use. The ingredients may settle over time. If this happens, simply give the bottle another shake.
