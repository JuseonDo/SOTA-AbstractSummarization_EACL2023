@article
 Describe the company culture to yourself, or ask employees how they would describe it. Decide if an innovative, competitive, informal, aggressive or other environment will mesh with your personality and enjoyment of the job.
 Generous paid vacation, or paid maternity/paternity leave can increase your contentment with the job. Although you won't be able to measure this strictly in terms of money saved or added, you can quantify it with reduced stress in your personal life.
 Once you know the percentage, decide if that is something you have the energy and ability to carry out, while still maintaining contentment in your personal life.
 Decide if you will have complimentary styles and ways of working together. A boss who you can respect and communicate with will reduce stress and increase your likelihood of success.
 Although you will be able to improve and change some aspects of communication, the company culture will determine whether you have open lines of communication on both ends. If you see little face to face contact and opportunities to discuss problems, you may see this as a warning sign of deeper problems.
 If you have a sense of foreboding or excitement about the job, try to articulate why that is. Your intuition may be able to lead you to a more thoughtful evaluation about the company itself.
