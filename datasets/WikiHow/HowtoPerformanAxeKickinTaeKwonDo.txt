, In reality you’re aiming for your opponent’s face primarily the nose. You can also aim for the neck-shoulder area.
 Bringing your knee up will make this kick get up to the desired height faster. If you keep your leg straight the whole time it makes this kick a lot harder to do when your opponent is close. Seeing how this kick is more of a close-range kick, you wouldn't want to be too far away from your opponent.
 Move the whole leg, keeping the knee slightly bent.
