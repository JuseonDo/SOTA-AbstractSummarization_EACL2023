 You may find another gardener in the process of dividing daylilies who would be willing to share some of the root divisions with you.;
,, Dig a hole approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep, and 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) in diameter to accommodate each root division you have.
 Place a root division on top and fan the roots out over the cone.
 Do not tamp down the dirt.
, Over-watering can cause crown rot. Daylilies are drought-resistant, but bloom best when they have adequate water.
 Daylilies don't require winter mulch.
 Dividing the plants will rejuvenate them and improve blooming.


Divide daylilies after they have bloomed, but prior to the first frost.
Raise the whole daylily plant clump from the earth. Slice it into 6 to 8 sections (root divisions). Each should have several growth buds on the roots.
Lop off the tops of the divided root sections.
Replant the individual sections. Arrange the new sections so that 24 to 30 inches (60 to 75 cm) of space lies between the sections. The daylilies will grow and fill in those gaps.
