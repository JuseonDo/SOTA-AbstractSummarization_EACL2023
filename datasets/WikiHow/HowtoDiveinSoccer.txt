 You won't be needing it for this maneuver.;
, Diving with nobody around will, at best, make you look like an imbecile.
 While one could dive with no contact, it is very difficult to make it look realistic. Diving is better used to emphasize a real challenge, making a legal tackle look illegal, then it is to make no challenge look like a foul.
 You want to throw yourself at the ground, in whatever manner you choose. However, ensure that it is consistent with the type of foul you are simulating. If you are faking a trip from behind, sprawl out forward. For a shoulder-to-shoulder challenge, fall sideways. To show a shirt-tug from behind, fall on your bottom.
 This is where you get to emulate the professionals... holding your leg and rolling around in pain. Again, be sure the faked injury is consistent with the foul and the fall. For a slide tackle from behind, hold your leg, to fake an elbow to the face, grab your nose.
