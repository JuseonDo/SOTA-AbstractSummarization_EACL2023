 You may want an explorer's ring for recharge, or (for members only) energy potions.
 Add the player to your friends list in case he/she switches worlds. Follow them around until you're noticed and asked to leave. Keep following anyway, if desired., Instead, follow by clicking on the map. Once you reach a clear area, you can use the "follow" command.,, Once he/she does, say "You're one of them...!" If the player says "One of what?" begin to walk away slowly, saying "No! Don't do that to me! Ahh!" After that message is gone, run away.
