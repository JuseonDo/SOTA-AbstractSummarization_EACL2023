 Boat rentals come in a variety of forms, from hourly and daily rentals to weeks-long charters. Rental operations may not offer a wide range of boat models, but they can provide a range of boat types for you to try. Rental fleets tend toward basic models, nevertheless, they can give you and your family a sample of the boating fun waiting for you on the water, and they are a great way to get your feet wet.;
, You may have no problem reserving a rental boat but if you are renting in peak season, reservations may be necessary to ensure the boat you want will be available for you.
 You can find most charts online and it will help if you have a working knowledge of the body of water before hand.
 Most boats are relatively simple to operate, although state regulations regarding powerboat operator licensing and certification may apply. A dock attendant will provide brief boating instructions to you before you set out. Consult your state Department of Natural Resources for listings of rental operations. If you are not comfortable driving the boat yourself, most rental facilities will either provide you with a captain (charter) or recommend one for you.
 Consult the company you're considering chartering from for policies.
 Especially if you have children on board. You should always have an emergency float plan.
