, Brush the mixture over the chicken pieces.
 Turn around gently to coat in buttermilk.
 Pour in the oil to a depth of 1 centimeter (0.39 in) (1/2") and heat it. Cook the bacon until crisp. Lift the bacon out and leave to cool. Once it has cooled enough to handle, cut into small pieces.
 Coat the buttermilk covered chicken with the bacon and breadcrumb mixture.
 Again, the depth of oil should be 1 centimeter (0.39 in) (1/2"). Heat gently.


It is important that the cooking oil temperature is not too hot because this can cause the outside to crisp before the inside is cooked. If you notice that the oil starts to smoke, it's too hot. Add a little more oil and reduce the temperature immediately.
 Fry for about 10 minutes. Turn once during the frying time. The amount of time needed for cooking will depend on the thickness of the pieces; a golden brown color is a good indication that the chicken is cooked.
 Sprinkle with salt.


Keep fried pieces warm in the oven until all are completed before serving.
