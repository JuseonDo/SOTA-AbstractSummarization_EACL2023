 It basically is trailing a fast racer, and due to the lower pressure and resistance, you can reach and even surpass your maximum speed. This helps a lot especially when trying to catch up or getting ahead of everybody by half a lap., Don't stay too close and don't stay too far away either or else nothing will happen. Make sure you are directly behind the racer as well., Try to copy the speed of the front driver while avoiding going too fast or you will crash, or too slow or you will be left behind., Once this happens, you should drive to the side and start streamlining baby! You will go so fast as if you just used a boost or a mushroom!
