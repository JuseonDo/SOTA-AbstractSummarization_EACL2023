 You can plan to come during the summer season as it is the best time to visit the scenic La Jolla Cove.;
,, Hence try to come as early as possible and park your vehicle in a paid parking lot in downtown La Jolla, just a short walk away.


Try to come early and have the best of snorkeling experience. It is an ideal snorkeling zone for beginners. You can rent snorkeling gears from the Coast Boulevard or Prospect Street.
La Jolla Cove is an ideal beach for scuba divers. However, check with the lifeguards before diving into the deep waters. Lifeguards are stationed year round at La Jolla Cove. Hence don’t worry about security.
 Always make sure there is a lifeguard nearby when you swim. And supervise your children even in the presence of lifeguards.
 If you need a shower, there are public restrooms with showers in La Jolla Cove and in the Scripps Park.
