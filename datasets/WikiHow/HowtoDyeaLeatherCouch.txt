 You can often find leather dye at a local tannery, a specialty leather shop or online at sites such as eBay and Leather Unlimited.


Combine colors if you cannot find a dye that is the exact shade you are looking for. For example, if you want a dark brown but the brown dye seems too light, mix a little black die into it. Use white dye to get a lighter color.;
, A basement, garage or even outdoor driveway will provide a good place to work.
, Do not soak the couch. Instead, lightly rub it with a cloth that you dip in soapy water and ring out.
 Dip a clean cloth or rag into the acetone and rub it all over the couch.
 You want the leather to be wet so it absorbs the dye, but not soaked.
 Place some dye onto a clean rag or cloth and then rub it onto the couch. Make sure you wear gloves to protect your hands.


Work in small patches at a time. This will make the process easier and it will keep the leather looking more consistent as you color it. Spray one section, then apply the dye. Spray the next section and apply the dye and continue until the entire couch has been dyed.
, You should put on as many coats as you need to get the right color you are looking for. Most leather couches will need between 3 and 6 coats.


Let the dye dry between each coat.
 This can be purchased wherever you get the leather dye. It may be called leather finisher or leather top coat. You can choose a glossy or satin finish.


Spray the finisher on the leather couch and rub it in with a damp, clean rag.
