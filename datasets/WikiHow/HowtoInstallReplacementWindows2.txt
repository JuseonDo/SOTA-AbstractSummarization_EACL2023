Some people take the height measurement from the top of the sill. This leaves room to attach a “header expander” to the top of the new window. Others, though, dislike using header expanders because they decrease effective window size, and complicate the trim process.
 Since the new unit will need to be installed at least close to plumb, adjust your measurements accordingly. This will ensure that you have the largest size window that can be installed plumb, and level in the opening provided.
 This is due to the fact that replacement windows are made to order in increments of 1/4.″
