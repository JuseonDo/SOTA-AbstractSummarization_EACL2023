, This is to clean it for use.,, Gently press down to ensure that it is sitting exactly in the position you'd like it to show., Spread onto the remaining area of the flat side of the cabochon too., Put the flat side of the cabochon onto the square, pressing firmly to form a backing. The cabochon must fit within each edge of the cardboard but don't worry about the edges sticking out––they'll be trimmed away shortly., You can place a heavy book on it to help it to adhere well at this stage., Shape the cardstock around the cabochon so that it fits it exactly and neatly., Place the cabochon onto it, rounded side facing downward. Paint the sealant onto the base of the cabochon (flat side). Brush one way and cover the edges carefully., Then repeat but brush in the opposite direction this time. Allow to dry again. Then pull away from the newspaper., Using nail polish remover, rub off any sealant or Mod Podge that has dripped onto the rounded surface of the cabochon. Any stuck newspaper can also be removed in this manner.

Use kitchen towel or toweling for this.
