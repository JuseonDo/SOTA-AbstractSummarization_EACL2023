If your demographic is younger than 40, it is a good idea to focus on online blogs, magazines and social media. All advertising should match your gallery's brand, in an attempt to create repeat patrons.
 Personally invite society columnists and photographers to the show for coverage. This is mostly done through email, but can also be done by a marketing service, fax or mail.
 Ask if they would like to cover it for their blog, and if they would be interested in doing an interview or a feature of an artist before the event. Post all blog advertising on your social media accounts.
 It is free to list an event on most of these sites, and some art websites list galleries. Make sure your event is listed on Yelp and local newspaper websites.
