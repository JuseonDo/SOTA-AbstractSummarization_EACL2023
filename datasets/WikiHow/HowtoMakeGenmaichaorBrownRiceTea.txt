 The thin layer will ensure even toasting of the rice grains.;
, Toast the rice until it takes on a dark brown color and emits a nutty, toasted aroma. Depending upon heat and pan, toasting time can vary, but it generally does not exceed much over five minutes. Do not leave the rice unattended because it can burn quickly.
 Then place the rice inside of a container for storage. Toast more rice if desired.
 One tablespoon of toasted brown rice will produce one strong cup of tea. Experiment with these amounts to suit your preference. Place the desired amount of rice inside of a tea sieve along with green tea leaves. One teaspoon of green tea leaves will produce one cup of tea.
 Plunge the tea sieve into the water once it is ready. However, if you are brewing just one cup, place the tea sieve into an empty mug and then pour the hot water into the mug. Steep for approximately three minutes.
 Pour genmaicha into a cup or mug.
