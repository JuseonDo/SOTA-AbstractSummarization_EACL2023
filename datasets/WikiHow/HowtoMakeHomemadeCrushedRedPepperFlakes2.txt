 This will ensure a mold-free dehydration. Usually, it takes about four months for a fully dried out chili with no preserves, chemicals or treatments.
 Simply twist and tug. Pat dry with a towel, to ensure the removal of dust or clinging particles.
 Snip the chilies with scissors over the mouth of the grinder. You can chop them too but that makes more mess. Less mess is good, as it's less chance of someone getting it into their eyes.
 They can be roughly ground into chili flakes or ground down further to a heavily seeded powder.
