 It's difficult to keep your cool, especially if you are being bullied in a public place. There are many different ways you can control your temper, but remember that there will be consequences for your actions should you respond to your bully's taunts.;
,, By hiding what truly upsets you from bullies, you guard yourself against it being used against you.
 In tense scenarios, even silly jokes can relieve the tension.
 Do not use this as a laundry list to try and punish your bully. Instead, approach an adult and let them know you've been having a hard time, that you're concerned about the bully because they've been acting out, and then if it's still appropriate, tell them about your experiences with the bully.
 If you feel hesitant about bringing an adult into the situation, remember that you deserve safe transportation free of bullying. If the adult you talk to does not take your concerns seriously, talk with someone else until you feel more comfortable about the situation.
 If you feel like you're being bullied, chances are there are others who either feel bad for you or are also being bullied. Bullies usually target people believed to be weaker than themselves, but banding together with your friends might make your bully reconsider hassling you.This is also a chance for you to get to know the other passengers better.
