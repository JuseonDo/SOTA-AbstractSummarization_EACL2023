The cable has two ends, a small one which plugs into the Blackberry, and a larger one which plugs into your computer. Plug in the miniature USB-end of the cable in the Blackberry's mini-USB port, and the standard USB-end to the computer's USB 2.0 port, usually found on the side of your laptop or in the back of your desktop.
The USB cable should come with your Blackberry. If you no longer have one, you can purchase one online for only a few dollars. Make sure that it is compatible with your particular Blackberry model.



If you haven't already installed the Blackberry Desktop Software to your computer, you can download it from http://us.blackberry.com/support/software/. Make sure to select the correct version of the software for your particular computer, then follow the on-screen instructions for installation.
