 Take beeswax (the lubricating type), and rub it over your shoes. Make sure you cover every part on the outside, and regularly touch up if the beeswax is coming off. Use a blow dryer or any type of heat to melt the surface of the wax, therefore making it invisible.
 This method is much easier and effective than taking out the full iron, waiting for it to heat, then putting everything away. Borrow your girlfriend's/sister's/wife's/daughter's straightener, or simply buy a cheap one from your nearby pharmacy.
 Gently blot with a cloth soaked in white wine to remove the stains. Test first on a piece of scrap fabric, in case it stains your clothes more.
 Windex can be used to safely restore the sheen to patent shoes. Spray the affected area, then wipe gently until the stain/mark comes off.
 This will help avoid the single sock search around the house. Use a safety pin, or other device that is water safe and will stay on when tossed around.
