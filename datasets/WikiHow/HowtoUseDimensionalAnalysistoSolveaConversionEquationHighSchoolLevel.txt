, Find out what unit you need to convert to, and what unit you have to work with to find that final answered unit.
 Jot it down on your paper.
 This step is crucial.
 Sometimes it's easy to decipher in the problem, sometimes it's not and needs to be found someplace (or could even be a multi-step problem). Example: If you are given centimeters and are asked to convert it to inches and you have the given fraction, you've got enough information to solve. If not (such as if you are given inches and need to convert to millimeters through a unit of centimeters), you'll need to do a little more work.
, The units will later cancel, leaving you the unit you'll eventually need to solve for as part of the numerator.


Sometimes, they'll make it easy and the numerator will become a quantity of 1, but that's up to the problems discretion and each problem is different.
 Understand that there could be an implied 1 (with no unit attached) with a unit of below the initial quantity you need to convert from.
