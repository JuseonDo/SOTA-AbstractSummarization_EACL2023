 Prepare the lamington pan by lining it with baking (parchment) paper, and approximately 5cm (2") over the top edges.;
, Beat them using an electric mixer for 10 minutes. It will take longer by hand, the end result should be thick and creamy. As you're beating the eggs, gradually fold in the sugar so that it dissolves after each addition.
 You should now have a smooth lamington batter.
 Use a spatula to spread out an even surface across the top.



Bake for 35 minutes or until a skewer or toothpick inserted comes out clean.



Place on a wire cooling rack to cool down.
 Mix the ingredients together in a heatproof icing bowl over the double boiler (bain marie) until even and lump-free. It must be a consistency thick enough to coat the cake pieces.
 Dip each square on all sides in the icing. Allow any excess icing to drain off over the icing bowl.



Use tongs to hold the cake if you don't want to get your fingers coated in icing.
, This will take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on humidity.
