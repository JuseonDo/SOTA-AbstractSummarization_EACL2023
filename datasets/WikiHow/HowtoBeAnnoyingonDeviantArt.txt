,, Many people find this vexatious. If you want to, be verbose and grandiose and on all possible occasions in your journal. Use myriad words and superlatives when your point could be made simply, or, better yet when you don't even have an even vaguely valid point to make.

 If your journal or artworks are annoying yet clever and witty, well composed or beautifully executed, you may obtain people's grudging admiration, that'll really annoy them. They may hate what you have written or drawn, but have to admit it's well drawn or written and possibly funny.
