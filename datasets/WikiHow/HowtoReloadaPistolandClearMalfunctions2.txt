@summary
practice at the range.

 Only execute this if you encounter a lull in the gunfight and are able to place yourself behind cover. You know you have spent some rounds from the current magazine and want to prepare for whatever may come next.
,,,, You should be able to feel and react immediately when the gun does not fire. When you pull the trigger, if you feel a "click", execute a malfunction type-1 clearing. If there is no click, look at the malfunction and act accordingly (remember it may be an empty magazine too). After shooting for some time you should be able to feel when the magazine is depleted, allowing you to execute emergency reloads very quickly. Over time you will begin to notice that the weapon will feel and sound different after firing the last round.
