@article
 Allow the ribbon to fray, as this is the most important step in the process of making your "clip-on" streaks.;
, This thread  will eventually break, but  continue pulling the first row until it breaks again. You will begin to see your vertical ribbon threads getting longer. Repeat this step until you get to the end of the vertical threads in this strand.
 If you like the thickness of your streak, skip to step 4. If not, repeat steps 1 and 2 until your streak has reached your desired width.
 Add a dab of glue to the curved part at the base of the pin and very carefully run your vertical ribbon threads through the pin. Allow time to dry.
 You may also glue the excess thread to the streak, as long as the streak is held in place, it should be fine. if you used glue in this step, allow time to dry.
,, If you decide you want to change your color, it should be easy to wash out the color and add extra glue if needed. You can then change the color of the streak.
