 Consider wearing a single gold or silver ear climber on one lobe only. Then, balance the climber with a coordinating stud in your upper cartilage., If you want to create an asymmetrical look, wear a single ear climber in one ear and a coordinating stud in the other ear. For example, try wearing a rhinestone ear climber and a rhinestone stud., If you wear additional earrings with an ear climber, make sure you don’t place the pieces too close together. Doing so will overcrowd the look. Try sticking to an ear climber with one or two additional pieces in the upper ear., A turtleneck or shirt with a high neck will draw attention toward your chin, highlighting the ear climber. Try wearing a simple gold or silver ear climber with a black or navy blue turtleneck sweater.
