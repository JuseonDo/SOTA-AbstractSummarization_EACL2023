 Creating a good defense background will assist you in attacks.
 Start creating your attack when you achieve 300 defense. Attack points helps you fight others.
 Only if you are into fighting others for more than 3 times without a break. Use caution because this uses up 2 experience points to level up.
 Energy is mainly used for jobs. If you really want your character to be on the legend's board, it's not advisable to put any experience points in the energy section. Focus on the other skills.
