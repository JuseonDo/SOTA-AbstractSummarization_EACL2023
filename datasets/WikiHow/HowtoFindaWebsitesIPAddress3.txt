 There are several apps that allow you to ping websites. You can get these apps for free from the App Store. Some of the more popular apps include:


Network Ping Lite
Ping - network reachability test
Fing - Network Scanner

, Most apps come with several network utilities. Select "Ping" from the app's main menu.
 Enter in the website address that you want to determine the IP for. You don't need to include the www. portion of the address.
 You should see the results start to appear in the readout.


If you can't reach the site, make sure that you've typed the name correctly.
 You'll only need to ping once to see the IP address of the site. Stop the ping process so you aren't hammering the site's servers.
 It will be displayed in the readout section of the app. If the website is protected by a VPN or content distribution network, you won't be able to see the real IP address.
