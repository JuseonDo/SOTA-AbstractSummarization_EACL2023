@summary
remember to set your machine on "gentle".
@article
, There are a couple of ways to do this:


You can zip your scarf into a lingerie bag that's made for washing small things so that you scarf doesn't free float in your wash.
You can also place the scarf into a pillowcase and fold it over close once (or twice) and safety pin it close. Your scarf won't tangle upon itself and stretch!

, When you set it on "Gentle" this keep the material from stretching or ripping.
