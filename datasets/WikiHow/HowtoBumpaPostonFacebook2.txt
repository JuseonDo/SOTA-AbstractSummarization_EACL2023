 Facebook will open to your News Feed page.


If you aren't logged in, type in your email address and password in the top right corner of the page and click Log In.
 It's at the top of the screen. You can only bump posts on Facebook groups (such as free classifieds).
 It will be in a drop-down menu below the search bar.


You may have to be a member of your selected group before you can post.
 Any post on which you can comment can be bumped.
 It doesn't matter what you type here as long as it's appropriate to the group.
 Doing so will post your comment. If you refresh the page, your selected post should now be at the top of the screen.
