 Cut to your desired length. Place wrong side up on a flat working surface.
 These additional panels ensure your tablecloth matches the width of your table. Lay the panels adjacent to your first one. If there's a pattern, ensure the patterns match up on the panels where you're placing them together. Adjoin them using sewing pins. Ensure that the panels are all wrong side up. It should now be the correct width for your table.
 A straight stitch is the most basic sewing stitch comprised of uniform length stitches weaved in and out of the fabric in a straight line. Remove pins as you sew.

Lay the fabric on top of the table. Cut an even line completely around the edge of the table at the bottom of your desired drop length.



Place fabric wrong side up on a flat surface. Fold fabric edges over about 1 inch (2.54 cm).
Fold this piece over again, which gives you a half-inch (1.27 cm) hem.
Pin completely around the edge of the hem.



Iron the hem when your sewing is complete.
