 It is all up to comfort and preference. For example:


Use your index and middle finger together and mash the button like an arcade shooter; or
Twitch your thumb; or
Use two fingers one after another.;
, You are able to train endlessly this way, but it is very hard to record mash time.
 They all require button mashing, especially Metal Slug. There are also many Flash games centered on button mashing, like king of Buttons 3. These games record your best mash times.
 Frequent practice will get you success!
