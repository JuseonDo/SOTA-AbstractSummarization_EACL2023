 Look for pictures that have rounded edges or round them as you cut. Do not use pictures that will require a lot of attachments. As much as possible try to cut in one piece, only adding ears, perhaps bunny puff tail.;
, Then on larger paper, make 2" squares and draw the picture into the larger squares copying from the smaller picture. Square off the picture or place on a window with graph over top and trace the picture outline. The same applies to make the picture smaller; use 1/2" squares (or as big or as small as you wish).
 Remember, you will need at least 1/4" extra for the seam. Place the two material pieces right side together and sew seam. Bind the seam edges to keep it from unravelling.
, You will want your toy to be squishy.
,, You can also use small buttons for eyes, yarn for whiskers or hair, pom pom for hair or tail. Again, remember that these add-ons can be very dangerous for children (or for animals) as they are a choking hazard.
 To cut these out, you need to cut 1/4" around away from the edge of the picture for your seam. These are a good example of how detailing can be added with embroidery or fabric paint.
