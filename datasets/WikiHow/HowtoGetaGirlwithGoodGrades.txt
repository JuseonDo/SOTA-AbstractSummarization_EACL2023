 If she's on honor roll, she won't be interested in a guy who can't pass a class. You don't have to become a genius, but try other ways to raise your grades: put some more effort in, pay attention in class, etc. At least try to rise to the academic level that she's on. Bonus: this means study dates!;
, She may not like designer jeans, but she's not heartless! Just work on a confident, carefree grin that shows you're not totally stupid.
 She wants to know that you pay attention to things around you.
 It's nice to know random facts, so if she brings up something in a conversation (for example, toothpaste) you can say something witty pertaining to something you read about brushing your teeth.
 It's a good idea to start with schoolwork: "Hey, do you have the homework?" or "What did you think of that assignment?" can't go too wrong. If she's on honor roll, she's a good student, so she probably does all her homework and understands the material.
 If she sits next to you in a class and you don't understand, ask if she can help you. But don't play dumb--remember, she probably wants someone who can understand things quickly.
 It makes you seem strong and she might like that.
, But do not act dumb, it will just annoy her.
