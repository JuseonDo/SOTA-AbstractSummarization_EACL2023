 It doesn't really matter. Any will do. Pack a backpack with papers and a lunchbox, and maybe a book or small pencil case. Your teddy is now ready to go to school.;
, Write a day plan and include subjects like math, reading, and writing. Fold a towel in half and lay it in front of the board. That's the mat.
 Put an exercise book on it (paper with coloured paper on the outside).
 Show him/her math problems on the board, punctuation marks, etc. Your teddy will soon have a brain full of facts!
