, Roll the bacon and hot dog around and around until the bacon covers the whole hot dog. Set aside.
 You might need to use toothpicks to hold the bacon in place––judge this as you roll.
 Add the butter or oil (use sparingly, as the bacon will make more fat as it cooks). Be mindful of spattering grease.
 Sprinkle with a little brown sugar, if desired.
 Turn over midway, when the bottom side has browned and the bacon has begun to get crisp. Fry until the bacon looks cooked. Note: You might need to drain some of the grease from the skillet at this point.
 Carefully lift out the cooked hot dogs with tongs or a spatula. Place on paper towelling to drain excess grease.
