 It is much better to have the fishmonger do this for you as it's a messy job and you have to keep the innards in your garbage.;
, After it is gutted, you can bake, barbecue or steam the snapper whole.
 If you prefer filleted snapper, purchase it this way or make the fillets at home. Fillets can be grilled, pan-fried, crumbed or battered.
 Snapper has a mild flavor, so it is a good accompaniment to Asian food flavors. Thai is a really great choice.
