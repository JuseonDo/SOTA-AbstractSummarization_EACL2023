 The Department of Education (“DOE”) offers a free College Navigator. This allows you to choose your area, major, and the type of program you are looking for (2-year, 4-year, or less than 2-years), and then generates a list of colleges that meet your requirements.;
, The best way to do this is to visit each institution’s website, which should provide a listing of all degree programs available. You can find each institution’s website using the College Navigator provided by the DOE. If an institution does not offer distance learning programs, cross it off your list.
