, This helps prevent infection while carrying out the piercing of your snakebites. You do not have to use gloves if your hands are clean, however if you are performing this piercing on someone else it is highly recommended you use latex gloves to prevent infection.
 You can do this by mouth washing for 60 seconds and also clean the outside of your lower lip with one of the suggested solutions and a cotton ball or bud. Once you have cleaned the area below discard of the cotton ball or bud you have just used to clean the area.
 This is easily done by lining a ballpoint pen vertical against the left and right side of your nose. Firstly, line a ballpoint pen vertical against the right side of your nose, this will help you to determine where on your lip the piercing should line, mark this point just below your lip. Do the same with the left side of your nose but also make the mark so that it is also at the same level below your lip as the other marking.
 Discard of the packaging once unwrapped. Next, line the piercing needle with your marking and pierce the skin at a direct horizontal angle piercing from the outside of the lip, inwards. It is usually best if you hold the lip either side of the marking in order to create a penetrable surface.
 Screw on the ball and repeat with the other side after sterilizing the needle with a cotton ball and cleaning solution.
 Once you have pierced your lip, clean the piercing 2-3 times everyday by mouth washing and using cleaning solution. Your piercing should take up to 6 weeks to heal, however in most cases the healing process usually takes longer. If you find that infection occurs you should remove the piercing immediately.
