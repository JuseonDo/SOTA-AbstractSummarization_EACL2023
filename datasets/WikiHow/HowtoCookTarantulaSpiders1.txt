, The sparkling water makes for a lighter batter, though you can use tap water or bottled water— the colder, the better.
 Traditional batter (in Japan) is made by stirring briefly with a couple of chopsticks.


It is okay to leave lumps in the batter and is best not to over-stir the batter as doing so tends to toughen the coating.
Make the tempura batter just before use. It is best made fresh and not stored for later use.
, Sever with a sharp knife, then discard the abdomens. Although some strong-stomached individuals happily consume the abdomens, tarantula abdomens are filled with a dark brown paste which contains the heart, the digestive system, and any eggs that might be developing.
 After singeing the hairs, run your fingers over the legs to remove the hair remnants and, at the same time, spread the legs evenly around the spider (as well as you can).
