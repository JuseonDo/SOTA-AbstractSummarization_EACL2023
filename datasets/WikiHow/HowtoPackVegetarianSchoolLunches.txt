 That's usually where they put all the fake meat (products like imitation cold cuts made from soy). Try to look for the best deals possible and don't overdo it. Organic foods can be much more expensive.;
, There's nothing lamer than not knowing what you're having for lunch since your mom packed it. It's also really cool if you can tell everyone you made the food yourself. Buy a vegetarian cookbook, watch cooking shows and search the web for recipes.
, People will envy you and want to be like you if you eat really healthy food and know a lot about nutrition.
 Just not eating meat is not a good way to stay healthy.
 It's probably not a good idea to bring something to eat that has to be eaten hot. Cold salads, soup, and smoothies are great!

, A great way to keep motivated is to compare your lunch to those of the people around you. While you're eating pita with spicy hummus, the rest of them just have burgers and ketchup. You'll feel like the coolest, most unique person there!
