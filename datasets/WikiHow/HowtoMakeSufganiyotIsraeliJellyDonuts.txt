 Let the mixture stand for fifteen minutes, and you will see it activating.;
, Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula.
 Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.
, If you prefer, you can mix the dough with your hands. Use a pair of gloves so your hands stay clean.
 Wet your hands slightly and lightly flour the dough as you punch and knead.


As you knead and punch the dough, add the lemon zest little by little so that it is evenly spread throughout the dough. Punch down and carry on kneading for at least 8 minutes after adding the zest. It should become a smooth, soft ball of dough after the kneading is over.
, Cover with plastic wrap or a clean cloth and put it in a warm place to rise such as near the stove or oven while you are cooking other dishes.
, Place the dough on the counter-top or board and start punching and kneading it once more, for several minutes before it is rolled out.
 Use a rolling pin to roll it out to 1/2" thickness.
 Keep making the leftover dough into a ball, rolling it out and cutting it till it is all used up.
 Cover again with plastic or a warm dish towel and set it once more in a warm place. Let it rise for another 90 minutes (1 1/2 hours) or until doubled in size. By now, it should be very fluffy.
, Let them fry on one side (about 20 seconds) then gently flip them over and allow them to fry on the other side.
, Use a Size 4 nozzle to fill each Sufganiyot with your choice of jam.


You can even fill the donuts with Dulce de Leche.
