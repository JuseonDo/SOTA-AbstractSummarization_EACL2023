 Try Toll House or you can make your own from scratch.;
, Get it golden brown.


Cook your marshmallow over the campfire. Use the coals, not the flame to cook it.
Hold your marshmallow about 12" (30 cm) from the coals. The key is to look for steam/smoke coming from the marshmallow. When you see this, it's turning brown.
Rotate the marshmallow to get it brown on all sides.
The slower it cooks, to softer it gets in the middle.
, Notice how the hot marshmallow, makes the chocolate chips, soft and gooey!
