,, Make it about 1/4 of the image.
 It will be the main color of the flower.
 Do this by clicking on the duplicate layer on your layer toolbar and then click on Layers >> Flip Vertical.
 Do this by clicking on Adjustments >> Hue/Saturation. This will help it to be more complementary of the main flower color.
, Do this by clicking on Effects >> Distort >> SineWaves. Start off with these settings until you get the hang of it.


The amplitude will determine the length of the petals. Lesser is better here.
The vertical periods will determine the number of petals.
 (In case you might need a gradient that color). Select, cut and paste on another canvas.
, You will find this by going to Effects >> Distort >> Paneling. What this does is take the leaves of the duplicate layer and place it between the leaves of the original layer.
 Click on Adjustments >> Brightness/Contrast. Performing this while the layers are still there allows one of the layers to be darker than the other.
, It is under Render >> Shape3D. Follow the example in this tutorial and then experiment once you know your way around.

At this point, you will have your completed flower.
 Do this by clicking on Effects >> Noise >> Add Noise.
