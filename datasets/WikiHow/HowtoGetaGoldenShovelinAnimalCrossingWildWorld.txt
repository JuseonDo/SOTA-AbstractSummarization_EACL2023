 Know that Tom Nook will never stock two shovels at the same time, so buy a shovel and check back every day for the other one. If you do not want to wait, you can time travel.;
, Go to a spot that you can see easily. It's also typically easier to bury around a spot that you are familiar with, for example, near your house or Town Hall.
, Make sure that you are standing close to the hole, and select the "Bury" option from the menu that should appear once you click on the shovel.
 Dig it up after that and receive the golden shovel.(if
