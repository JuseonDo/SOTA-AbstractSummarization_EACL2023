 If you ask a girl that, you can generally get an idea of what type of movie she likes and can also determine the genre of movie she likes to watch. not every girl is interested in touchy feely types of movies.;
, With that in mind it should be easier to pick the right kind of movie.
 Women are complex and when depending on her mood depends on how close to you she will be during the film.
 If she is into a comedy movie. Don't go and rent the Notebook. Because she will lose interest and most likely fall asleep. And if she is a true romantic, don't go and rent What happens in Las Vegas. Mood and personality is really what counts during the date.
 When you put a lot of time and effort into a date, along with dedication, women appreciate it along with the littlest things. It could be making sure its great temperature in the room so she isn't too cold or too warm. Also make sure that everything is perfectly ready when she comes into your house. Make sure that your home isn't a total pigsty either because cleanliness isn't as distracting as a mess.
 When she walks in, compliment her. Even if she looks bad, find a way to say something nice about her. And remember that when you have picked a movie, if she falls asleep in your arms then you did something right. Be confident and also be sure to make her feel as welcome and comfortable as possible. If she says that she enjoyed herself, then don't hesitate to say a corny line afterwards. it may suck but she will love you for the effort.
 She liked you bad enough then she will call or text you first. It's never a good idea to try to cling to someone after a good date. Let things cool down and go on with your life as if it never happened. She will notice you again and that's when it all starts to come together.
