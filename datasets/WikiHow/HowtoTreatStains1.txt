, If you apply stain remover with the stain facing up, the stain may soak through the fabric. By placing the stain face down on the towel and applying the solution to the back, you'll prevent this problem.
 Then, wash the garment in that temperature water.
 Drying can set the stain, making it a pain to get out. If there are signs, keep washing.
