 The very first step towards making anyone feel comfortable is a clean home! Make sure the floor is clear of all clothing, misc objects, and trash. Clear the kitchen sink of dishes, empty trash cans, etc. Everything should have a place and everything should be in its place.;
, Your home should reflect you, but please make sure there are no obscene or extremely odd statues, pictures, etc around. You don't want to make your guest feel uncomfortable just being or even looking around your home.
 The same goes if you have a pull out couch/bed. You want your guest to be as comfortable as possible if they are staying the night.
 These are important and make your guest feel welcome.
 Let them explore their surroundings and get settled in, but do not forget to give them a guided tour first!

, If they come in the evening or from a long flight/ride, offer dinner. You never want hungry guests! Always ask what THEY want to eat.
 Try to cook something a little more extravagant than what you would normally make for yourself. They should have an array of options to choose from. If you don't know what they like, ask!

, Unless your guests request otherwise!

, Also, make sure they are not allergic to any types of pets before you invite them in your home!
