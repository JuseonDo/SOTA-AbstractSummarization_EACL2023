 Start out with, of course, MySpace and/or Facebook.
 After that, try branching out to other sites that tend to be "scene-popular", such as Twitter, Stickam, thescenekidz.grouply.com, Buzznet, formspring.me, and Model Mayhem.
 This is where you can "model" for different "agencies" run by other people, and it can earn you some major scene points. You can often find these sites as profiles on Facebook and Myspace. After a while, you can even go elite and apply for the elite agencies.
 Having a catchy screenname, although totally optional, will also raise your scene-point quota.
 Have an account and maybe make some videos on "How to Style Your Scene Hair," etc., because they are becoming increasingly popular in the scene world and will increase your scene image. If you become more popular on YouTube, you could even start a video blog about anything you like.
