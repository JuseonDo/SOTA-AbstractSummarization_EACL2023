 The size should be appropriate for the the objects you will photograph. You may find that you need to make boxes in various sizes.
 Use more packing tape to secure the bottom flaps inside. This will keep them out of the way.
 Have the opening facing you.
 A standard 12" (30cm) ruler makes the perfect straight edge and is the right width.
 You can use the ruler as a straight edge to guide your cut. It is not necessary to get the cuts absolutely straight. Notice that the flaps on the front of the box have been left on for now to add stability and make it easier to cut. You may find that taping the front flaps shut makes it easier to cut.
, Then tape it to the outside of the box using cellophane tape. Start with one layer of fabric. After completing the box and making some test shots, you may find that you need additional layers of tissue paper to achieve the right lighting.
, The piece should be in the shape of a rectangle, with the width being the same as a side of the box, but the length being twice as long.
 Curve it gently; don't crease it. Trim it if necessary. This will create an infinite, edgeless look for the background of your shots.
 This will allow you to block light from certain directions when taking photographs.
 Photo lights, flashes, and even standard desk lamps can be placed on either side or above the box to produce the desired lighting effect.
 See how well your tissue paper filters and diffuses the light. Add layers of tissue paper as needed. This photo was taken in the example light box, and is not retouched (other than cropping). Now go start taking great photos!
, Take a look at this sample image taken from the box this process built.
