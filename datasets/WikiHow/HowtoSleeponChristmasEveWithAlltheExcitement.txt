 With all the excitement, try to make your night routine as normal as you can. Double check everything as well. With all the excitement, you may forget to do something important. Or you can watch a Christmas movie or two to help you fall asleep. Or a book would be better if you love books.;
, Exercising no later than three hours before you go to sleep will help you sleep at night. , It will keep you awake.
 You will feel relaxed and it will make you sleepy.
 Avoid caffeine eg. coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Stick to warm milk or herbal tea. Don't have any energy drinks either, it will make you hyper.
 You can watch a Christmas movie or your favorite television show.
 Don't read horror or an action-packed thriller. This will make you feel more awake. Also, try to make sure it's not Christmas-related because it will make you more excited, which will make you stay awake longer.
 Example: If you go to bed at 10pm and your usual bedtime is 9pm, it will feel like Christmas. If you go to bed at your normal time, it will feel like a normal night.
 It will only make Christmas more exciting. You don't want to see what presents you've got until the morning.
 If you are having trouble sleeping, do an activity to help you sleep, ex. counting sheep, doing your times tables in your head, etc.
 Exercise, don't rest and make yourself do more than one task at the same time. Ex. do jumping jacks while talking on the phone with your best friend, this way at the end of the day when it's time to go to bed you be so tired and excited at the same time you'll just fall asleep.
