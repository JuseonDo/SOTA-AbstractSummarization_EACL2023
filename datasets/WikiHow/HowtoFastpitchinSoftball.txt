 Before you play a position, learn all that you can about it so that you know how to best play it. Talk to the coach, to fellow team players, to people who know softball. You can also look at online softball websites and borrow books on the topic. There is no need to be in the dark about the game, its techniques and the tricks for the position you're playing.;
, Wear appropriate softball clothing; if your club has a uniform, get this organized ahead of time, either new or used. Be sure that it fits comfortable before purchasing.


Don't forget the appropriate shoes, again sized for comfort.
,, And start out by throwing overhand first; this helps you to loosen up a little.
 Every league makes you start off with at least one part of your foot on the rubber. If you're right-handed, put your right foot on the rubber at a favorable angle and put your left foot on a small backward angle.
 It's similar in position to when you're about to run a race but you're not totally bending down.
 Then bring them together at about the neck-line. The form should make a circle. Then push your arms out in the same circular motion until your arms make a K-position with your body.
 At the same time, snap your pitching wrist and fold it up like it's trying to slap you.
, Do this without the ball. Snap it hard.
,, This means aiming to hit every pitch in the same spot.
 Then aim to pitch at different speeds. This will make you the best pitcher on your team.
