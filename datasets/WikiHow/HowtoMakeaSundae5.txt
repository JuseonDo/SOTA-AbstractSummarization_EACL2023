 Keep whisking until the yogurt is light and fluffy, and the honey and vanilla are mixed evenly throughout., Although the recipe calls for bananas and strawberries, you can use other types of fruit as well, including blackberries, raspberries, mango, and kiwi., Save the rest of the yogurt for the later layers., Continue layering the yogurt, syrup, granola, and fruit until you have nothing left. Finish off with a thin layer of granola on top., For that final sundae touch, you could even add some chopped nuts or sprinkles. Top it off with a small strawberry on top., If you won't be eating it right away, you can cover it and refrigerate it for up to 3 hours.
