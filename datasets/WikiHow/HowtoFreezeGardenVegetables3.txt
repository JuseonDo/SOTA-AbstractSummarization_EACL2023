 You need a pot that has a lid and fits an interior rack. The rack must be positioned 3 inches (7.62) or more above the bottom of the pot.
 Do not pile the vegetables, since the steam needs to be evenly distributed.


Select a garden vegetable that does well with the steam blanching method. Asparagus, broccoli, and chili peppers are among the best options. These vegetables benefit from slow steam blanching because this method allows them to retain more of their water-soluble vitamins, which might otherwise be lost by using standard water blanching.
 Cover the pot and continue heating for as long as necessary according to expert recommendations for each vegetable.
 Shock them by transferring the vegetables to a large bowl or pot of ice water. Allow the vegetables to sit in the icy water for the same amount of time they sat in the steam, using 1 pint (500 milliliters) water for every 1 pound (450 grams) of vegetables.


Keep the water at a minimum of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius), if not lower.
 Use a strainer or large pasta drainer to separate the vegetables from the ice water.
