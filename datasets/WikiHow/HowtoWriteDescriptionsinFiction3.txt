@summary
when you come to write your story, and you introduce the character, you will need to "establish" them.

@summary
try to refer to characteristics and traits obliquely or indirectly:

@summary
instead of:

@summary
john was tall and thin, and wore his tee tucked tightly into his pants.

@summary
say what the character is doing when you introduce them, and use that as a way to tell the reader about their personality:

@summary
instead of:

@summary
john was the anxious sort; he was always worried about trivial things.",

@summary
once you've got your character established, you can add more details about them at your leisure.

@summary
give your characters room to develop.
@article
 Establishment is giving the reader a firm and recognizable picture of the character, so that next time the character appears you will not have to remind the reader of who they are. You should always try to do this with as little detail as possible. Select a defining and or a symbolic physical characteristic. Select a couple of defining personality traits, and use only those.
 He was always fastidiously neat.
try something like:

John's tight blue tee was stretched down his long, lean torso, and tucked fastidiously into his freshly pressed pants, whose knife-edge creases sharpened his long, thin legs all the way down to his sensible Oxfords

A good trick is to avoid "was" or "is", and for clothing to avoid "wear" and "wore"



,
try something like:
John stood on tiptoes, just back from the curb, trying to hail a cab with one hand and keep his umbrella over him with the other, all the time watching for the next car that might pass to close and splash dirt over his clean Chinos.
 You don't have to tell the reader everything right away. Just like getting to know a real person, let the reader find out more over time.
 This means that their personality can evolve and change in response to what happens in the story. This can affect their physical appearance (in which case the change may be both defining and symbolic). Think of how the events in the story might affect the character. Perhaps by the end, John will be less obsessed with the neatness of his clothes.
