 Above and below are items/ingredients that will be needed at some point during making this treat. Make sure all is gathered/set out before you begin.;
, Using parchment paper line a 10x10 pan with parchment paper so that it covers all sides.
 Using a nonstick agent, grease the pan. (For example, butter, PAM, spray, etc.)

, Place 1/4 cup of unsalted butter in a bowl (microwave safe) and microwave for 10-15 or just long enough to soften it.
 Stir in all of the sugars, corn syrup, and milk into the same bowl as the butter.
 Microwave the candy mix for two minutes.
 Stir once more and pour into the pan prepared earlier. Tap/lightly shake pan until the hot candy is level against all sides.
 Set aside the pan to cool for one whole hour, use the parchment paper to pick up and let it cool for another whole hour.
 Using a knife, cut the candy mixture into squares. (1.5x1.5 if you want an exact measurement.)

, Line another baking sheet with parchment paper.
 To do this place a mini marshmallow in the center of each of the squares of caramel you cut.
,,, Place each one on a baking sheet.
