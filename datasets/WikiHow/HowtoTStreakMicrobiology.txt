flip to the back of a sterile petri dish containing agar.

@summary
draw another line starting from the left side of the back plate until you hit the other side.

@summary
label the back plate of the petri dish with relevant laboratory information such as your initials, date, time and culture source.

,begin by connecting the bunsen burner to a fuel source and igniting it.

@summary
insert the loop into the flame at a vertical angle.

@summary
remove the loop from the flame.

@summary
remove the inoculation loop from the petri dish.

@summary
hold the sterile inoculation loop.

@summary
insert the loop into the culture, swirling the contents to insure even distribution of bacteria within.remove the loop and recover the original sample.

@summary
lift the lid of the petri dish just enough to insert the loop.

 Draw a line starting slightly above the center point. Continue drawing the line until you hit the back plate's edge.
 This new line should be perpendicular to the original line, intersecting it at the starting point. The back plate of the petri dish should now be divided into three sectors, appearing as a large “T”.



 

,,, The object is to have the inoculation loop be slightly above the inner blue cone of the flame. Hold it there for several seconds.
 At this point, the loop is sterile and extremely hot.

The inoculation loop must be cooled, or else the residual heat will kill any bacteria taken from the culture.
 Lift the lid of the petri dish just enough to insert the loop. Touch the outer edge of the nutrient agar. A sizzling sound should be heard upon first contact. Continue holding the inoculation loop against the surface for several seconds.
 Avoid touching any other surface at this point, doing so will recontaminate the inoculation loop., Open the source of your culture such as broth culture., Do this for several seconds.
, Beginning in the top sector of the “T’, lightly drag the inoculation loop across the surface of the nutrient agar in a zigzag pattern. It is important to stay within the region in which you are currently inoculating.
 Follow the method described in Sterilizing the Inoculation Loop. Remember to cool the inoculating loop on the edge of the nutrient agar that has not been contaminated with the original culture!,, Lightly drag the inoculation loop across nutrient agar toward the second sector., Lightly drag the inoculation loop across the nutrient agar in a zigzag pattern.
