 Because it involves lighting the absinthe on fire and then placing your palm over the shot glass to extinguish the flame, you're quite literally toying with fire. If you are unsure about the directions or feel unsafe about the thought of performing them, please do not attempt. You're literally toying with fire.


Also understand that this method involves drinking a shot of absinthe straight, without dilution. As absinthe can be an incredibly strong alcohol, this method is not recommended for light drinkers.
 Make sure the absinthe does not fill the shot glass completely. Also make sure that the palm of your hand fits comfortably over the whole rim of the shot glass. You will not be able to perform the backdraft trick if the rim of the glass is bigger than your palm.
 The flame should take immediately and burn easily because of the alcohol content of absinthe.



Note: Do not let the absinthe burn for a long time. Bad things can happen the longer you let the absinthe burn. The shot glass gets hotter, increasing the risk of burning your hand. The flame also burns away the alcohol and herbs of the absinthe, ruining the delicate flavors. Also, your glass can crack if you let the flame burn too long, or, if you're using a plastic cup, it can melt (and also release plastic fumes).
 You should feel a suction effect if you place your hand over the entire rim of the shot glass.


Although you'd think it would burn to place your hand over the flame, the flame is pretty much immediately choked out since it no longer has any oxygen to serve as fuel. Counterintuitively, this process shouldn't hurt at all if you don't let the absinthe burn for very long.
 Lightly remove only a portion of your palm from the shot glass instead of removing your entire hand at once.
 Enjoy it at your leisure or down it in one fell swoop.
