,, If it has a sliding door, great. If not, just make sure it doesn't escape.
 Open the carrier and let your pet run out on the other side, far away from you.


At first it might be confused and cautious. Just sit cross legged, and stay still. Eventually, it might come a bit closer.
 Keep staying still. Remember, this is all new to them, but once they get used to it, you're like a giant jungle gym!

, Let them climb on it, but do not pick them up.
 Place them gently on your foot. They will probably climb off right away, but now you have placed the thought in their mind that they can climb on you.
 Put them back in the carrier, and take them back to their cage.
 They may not climb on it, but they probably will not bite. If they don't, job well done! If they do, try it again another time! You have not failed, because your pet probably trusts you more than before!

, Even when your pet has been trained, it's still fun for both of you, so do it whenever you like!
