 If you're having a difficult time trying something, maybe you're not doing it right in the first place! Look around for anything you may have missed; a special piece of cover to hide behind while fighting, or a ledge to cling to for a jump, or an important item on the ground.;
, Often these will reward you with power-ups, supplies, or even all new equipment! Be especially aware of side-quests in Role Playing Games, as they often supply you with items you can't find anywhere else in the game.
 Adjust your gaming area so that there aren't any distractions, and make sure that you are in a mood where you can deal with some annoyances.
 This is the most important thing to keep in mind! Even if it takes you awhile to beat a game, keep trying at it, you'll get there eventually!

, This is pretty easy to do. If you feel yourself getting angry or annoyed with the game, just turn it off and do something else! You can always come back to it!

, People think differently, and they might suggest something that could help.
 You'll be amazed of what you can think of if you are not playing it!

, sometimes, the developers puts in little tips for helping you beat tough enemies. plus, it always tells you how the game works, and sometimes, it says how to do sophisticated commands (like a combo move in a fighting game.)
