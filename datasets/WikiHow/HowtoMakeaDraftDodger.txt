measure the area where your draft dodger will be placed (along the bottom of a door, the inside ledge of the window, etc.).

@summary
select fabric and thread.

@summary
cut your fabric the same length as the inside of the bottom edge of your window (or along the bottom edge of your door), plus 1 1⁄4 inches (3.2 cm) to allow for a 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) seam x 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) wide.

@summary
with the "right" sides of the fabric facing, fold the fabric length-wise and pin it together along the open edges, placing the pins about 4" apart.

@summary
on the sewing machine, sew one end and the long side of the tube closed, using a 5/8" seam.

@summary
turn the tube right-side-out.

@summary

 This will help you determine how much fabric you will need. The average amount is about 36" x 8" - about a quarter of a yard.;
, Select a fabric that's a little on the heavy side. Corduroy, denim, upholstery fabrics (one leg of a pair of denim jeans is just about perfect). Select thread that is compatible with the fabric weight and color you've chosen.
, You now have a pinned, rectangular "tube" that is inside-out.
 Do NOT sew both ends closed. Remove ALL pins.
 Begin at the closed end of the tube. Insert the handle end of a spoon or other blunt-ended tool (even a pencil will do) into the closed end. This can be a little tricky to get started. Working with your fingers, manipulate the tool through the full length of the tube until the spoon brings the closed end out the open end. Now you have an open-ended tube that is right-side out.
 Using a dowel, (broom handle, yardstick, etc.) fill the tube with chunks of stuffing; a little at a time. Push each "chunk" as far as it will go each time. Leave enough room at the open end to form a 5/8" seam. (TIP: When using pourable filling materials, like kitty litter or sand, use a funnel to pour into the Draft Dodger--leaving one inch unfilled at the top.)

, Carefully fold the raw edge of the open end of the tube towards the INSIDE of the tube to form a neat edge for hemming. Pin it closed. Using a needle and thread or on the sewing machine, stitch the end closed.
 You'll be amazed at the difference it makes!
