 If using wood direct from the pallet, remove pieces for using in the frame. Choose four pieces to form the frame, and ensure that they are all long enough.


Have some spare pieces; these can be added on as extra embellishment or used if you make a mistake with another piece.
 Choose the measurements and use these to guide the sawing of the wood.
 Following the chosen measurements, saw the wood pieces into both the width and length you're after for the frame.
 This will even the sizing of each piece of wood.
 Glue the four pieces together at each intersection where they meet.


Use clip clamps to hold the pieces together tightly. Aim for a very neat and close fit at each corner; the clamps will help apply the needed pressure.
Leave until the glue is fully dried before removing the clamps.
 If you would like to decorate it, do this either instead of varnishing or in addition to.


The frame can also be painted one or more colors; it depends on whether you'd like the natural wood look or you'd like it to be painted.
 The picture will slide in from the top. Add a hanger or a cardboard stand to the back.
 All done!
