go ahead and let them walk around or pat them.

some hedgehogs prefer to explore, but most love to take a nap on you while you watch tv or surf the web.most hedgehogs shouldn't be messed with in the cage unless you're getting them out to handle or bathe; the only exception is for those hedgehogs with excellent temperaments who are not at all fearful of your presence (putting quills up, hissing, etc)

 Hedgehogs are great at sensing fear, and if you are scared and nervous, they will be scared and nervous, making it a bad experience for everyone.;
, Don't mess around and try to poke it awake or make it aware of your presence by hovering your hand. Hedgehogs are prey animals with poor eyesight, and this is seen as a threatening gesture. Gently, but assertively, scoop them up using both hands. If they curl up, scoop some bedding up with them and gently roll them from one hand to another to get rid of the shavings.
 Some hedgehogs have been well socialized and bred or have better temperaments; they should unroll pretty quickly. However, some are not so great and require more time. Keep your hands flat and let them wake up and get used to everything. When they are out, their quills are down, and they're looking around/sniffing, proceed.
 If you plan to pat your hedgehog in the face, remember to start from the nose and all the way over the rump very gently. However, most hedgehogs don't like or tolerate the petting of their face or horns (the quills just above the eyes), so if they prefer, just pet their back and rump. Some hedgehogs, due to poor socialization or breeding, don't like to be pet at all. Just remember to always use gentle, slow, non-threatening motions. Always keep in mind hedgehogs are prey animals - they have poor vision but great hearing, smell, and extra sensory perceptions.
 They'll feel very safe and protected, and even better, will associate you and your scent with this awesome feeling.
 This will also help them associate you with happy times!
