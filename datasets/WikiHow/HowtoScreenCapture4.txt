 The way you take screen shots will depend upon how old your phone is and what type of OS it is running.
 If you have 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher, a screen shot function is built in for easy use.
 Navigate to the image on your screen that you would like to capture.
 Simultaneously press the "Power" button. Wait for the screen to flash and say the image was saved.
