 Every email by Blizzard has the header "Blizzard Entertainment" or "noreply". Keep in mind that the phishers do the same thing.;
, Mouse over a link in the email and look at the bottom left hand side of your screen where it shows where the link goes to. If it shows anything but an address that starts with "us.battle.net" (for US customers), then it's likely the email is a scam.
,, For Yahoo, at the top of the email you should see a picture of what looks like some sort of gear. Click that, and a drop-down menu appears. Click on View Full Header. A lot of information shows up, but don't be intimidated. What we want is in the first few lines of the wall of text. On the fourth line from the top, you should see "Return-Path:". The email following that should say something along the lines of "email.blizzard.com". To get to this page using Google Mail, open the email up and next to the reply button you'll see a drop-down arrow. Click that and select "Show Original". If you see an email that ends in "@yahoo" or "@gmail", or anything other than a Blizzard address, it's a phishing email.
,,,, Blizzard requests that you forward all possible phishing emails to hacks@blizzard.com
