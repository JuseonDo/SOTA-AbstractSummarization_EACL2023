as a rule of thumb, remember that generally a horse needs 2-3% of its body weight in feed daily.

For a horse in Light work this should be 80% Hay to 20% hard feed.
Medium work is 70:30
Hard work is 60:40
Racing work 50:50
A horse weighing 500kg in Medium Work would need 10-15kg in feed per day, lets say 10kg, 7kg of this would be hay/haylage and the other 3kg would be your concentrate feed. This should be fed over 3 meals a day.



Worm them regularly.
Keep them snug in a rug.
Don't overwork.
