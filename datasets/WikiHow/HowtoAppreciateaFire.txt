 Fires in fireplaces with fake ceramic logs and running on gas will not make any of those sounds, but you may be able to hear a hiss though.;
, The patterns are ever changing and delight the eye and mind. Watching flames can be meditative.
 Look at and enjoy the sparks flying into the air.
 Do not inhale smoke that you can see; you can still smell it from a little further away, and it's not strong enough to make you cough.
