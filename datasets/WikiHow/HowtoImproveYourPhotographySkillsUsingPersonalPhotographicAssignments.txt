 No matter what, just that one lens. Make it work. If it's a zoom, pick a focal length and stick with it. You will learn that focal length and a lot more about composition. (If you can't do it for the weekend, try it for a day).;
, It will help, considerably, to use Aperture Value or Aperture Priority (or whatever they call it).
, Stay completely out of any of the programmed modes., (You might want to make sure your vision is good or your diopter is set correctly.)

, If you have a backup, or one that you don't use often, use it. (This is really only helpful if you also shoot with film).
 Some rules are:Rule of Thirds
Balancing Elements
Leading Lines
Symmetry and Patterns
Viewpoint
Background
Depth
Framing
Cropping

, Get some practice in. Something like panning or freezing action, etc.
 Practice using it with various subjects and angles.
 No, not copyright violation, but try to reproduce the effect they accomplished in the photograph.
