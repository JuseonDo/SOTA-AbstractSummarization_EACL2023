, If people and organizations are talking positively about a safety riding school, then that is an optimistic sign that you should take into consideration when making your final decision.
 Personal testimonials from former students are a great way of selecting schools because they have first-hand experience. Friends also have nothing to lose by telling you that the school is not so good.
 This will ensure that you will receive the best quality motorbike safety training. Additionally, attending a recognized motorcycle safety school may entitle you to discounted insurance rates.
 Ideally the riding instructors should be commercially licensed and accredited, and should have more than the 3 year minimum riding experience requirement. Veteran riders can offer more varied training based on their vast scope of experience. You also want to know where school instructors received their basic training, how advanced they are, and how often they teach.
 You also want to make sure that the school provides a bike size that you can ride. Often, beginner courses provide the bikes and mandate that you use them, whereas intermediate classes allow you to bring your own bike, so make sure that you will be comfortable learning on the bikes that are provided. The last thing you want is to learn on a heavy cruiser if you are of a small build, and you also don't want to ride a light street bike if you are of a larger build.
 Many motorcycle safety courses provide you with the helmet and gloves, but many will expect that you bring and wear riding boots before getting on a bike., Since you will most likely be riding on the road, you really want to train on asphalt or concrete. This will better prepare you for a real driving experience.
