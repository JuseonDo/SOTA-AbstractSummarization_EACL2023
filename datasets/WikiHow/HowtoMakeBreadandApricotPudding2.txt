Cut the dried apricots into quarters.
Trim the crusts off the bread. Then cut into 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm)-thick slices, crosswise.
 It is appropriate to overlap the slices, just don't let them extend above the pan sides.
 Push the pieces in between the slices of bread you've already arranged. With what is remaining, sprinkle across the top of the bread slices.
 Add the half and half, vanilla extract and orange liqueur or orange juice. Whisk everything together and blend well.
 Do this carefully and slowly, covering the entire dish evenly. Let the egg mixture stand until the bread almost completely absorbs it; this will take around half an hour to 40 minutes.


You can help the soaking process by spooning the liquid over the bread now and then.
 Bake the pudding for about 30 minutes or until the custard no longer flows when the pan is tilted.


Be sure to wear oven mitts before tilting the pan to check.
 If you want a golden hue to the top, broil or top-down grill the top for just a few minutes.
 The pudding can be served warm from the oven or cold. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.,
