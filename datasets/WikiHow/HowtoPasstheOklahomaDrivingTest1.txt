You can take a class taught by an instructor certified by the Oklahoma DPS as young as age 15.
You must wait until you are at least 15.5 years old to begin parent-taught driver's education. The course must be purchased from a parent-taught driver education provider approved by the Oklahoma DPS.
Either course must include 30 hours of classroom training and 55 hours of driving. At least 10 of the behind-the-wheel hours must be during nighttime.;
, With a learner permit, you must have someone who is at least 21 years old in the front seat with you when you are driving.
 Wear your glasses or contacts.
 If you require glasses or contacts to pass the test, you must wear these vision corrective devices while driving.
 You should know the information in the Oklahoma Driver's Manual before taking the test. If you don't pass the test, you'll have to wait at least 1 day to retake it. You'll be assessed another $4 fee (all fees are paid upon successfully passing the test and receiving the learner permit) for each retake.
 As of 2011, the license fee is $21.50 plus $4 for the application and $4 for each written test retake.
