 These are readily available at drug stores and online. One website with an extensive inventory of drug detection devices is http://www.origindiagnostics.com/. Do not feel you must purchase devices from this site; it simply provides an overview of what is available on the market.
 Giving an individual warning beforehand could allow them time to alter the test results by staying clean for a period of time, or even by securing clean urine or blood to substitute for their own.



Never force someone to take a drug test against their will. Doing so is ethically wrong, and there could be legal repercussions.
Remember that drug tests are not 100% accurate. For example, if you were to terminate an individual’s employment on the basis of a single drug test, legal action could result.
