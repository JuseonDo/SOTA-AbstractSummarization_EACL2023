 This will lessen the cleanup that you will have to do.
 It isn't required, but it certainly can help in processing it.
, The software here is Camera RAW.
 Some of the steps that you may need to take are:


Adjusting the white point. This will help bring out the white of the smoke if it is hard to see.
Possibly bringing down the exposure
Try adding to the contrast
Adjust (increase) the black point
Experiment with the temperature and tint, as well.
 That will reduce the cleanup that you have to do.



To get an idea about how much cleanup you have to do, select the Selection wand, with a tolerance of about 20 or so, and click on the black. You will quickly see where the errant spots are.
 Depending on your mood or the day, you may see different things. Some things that you can do are invert its color, mirror it, etc.
