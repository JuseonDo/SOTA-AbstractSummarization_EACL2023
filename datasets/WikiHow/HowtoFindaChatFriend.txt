@article
 Just create an account and put in the search bar your hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc. and you get a long list of people.;
, And speaking freely merely does not mean talking about everything. You shouldn't start with narrating your family or personal issues and NEVER tale about erotic subjects. DON'T BE A PERVERT.
 Give them equal opportunity to tell you stuff about themselves. Give them a chance to tell you their interests and things they like or dislike.
 They may not be comfortable with it. Get to know them first. Make sure they understand you're not some pervert or an unsafe person to talk to.
 If you wish to meet them, don't be a pusher and give them time to think about it. For your safety, too, don't consider meeting before you're well acquainted with them and talk to your parents.
 That is important.
, If you're going to not be able to reply to them for a while, inform them. They should not think you lost interest and ditched it.
