When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.;
, When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper.


Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.
 If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.
