 This will give you about 1 Â½ cups (350 milliliters) of sugar water.If you need to make more/less sugar water, then use one part water to one part sugar.;
, The high temperature will help dissolve the sugar water faster. Be sure to stir often to help the sugar dissolve.
 As soon as the water begins to boil, reduce the heat and bring the water to a simmer. It will take about three minutes for the sugar to dissolve., Set it down onto a heat-resistant surface and let the mixture return to room temperature.
 Place a funnel into the neck of a glass bottle, and carefully pour the sugar water into the bottle. If you cannot find a bottle, you can use a glass jar. Put the cap on the bottle and close it tightly.
 Use it within one month.You can use sugar water to make lemonade or cocktails.
