, When the "Pages" dialogue box appears, you should see all your pages that comprise your document.
 The first page in your list may be the cover, which often does not have a page number.
 You can also zoom onto the lower right corner if you are using a right page as your first numbered page. Most people start numbering in the lower left hand corner.
 It is an uppercase "T" on your left panel.



You must make the box very wide. InDesign will automatically update page numbers when you are through and it requires that the box could fit the number 1,999, even if your page numbers will remain low.
, A menu will appear to the right of "Insert Special Character." Scroll down to "Markers." Unlike symbols, markers can change depending upon the length or other changes to the document. In the menu that appears to the right of "Markers," choose "Current Page Number."


The shortcut on a Mac operating systems (OS) is to press "Command," "Shift," "Option" and the letter "N" at the same time. You should use this if you will be using this command a lot.
The short cut on Windows OS is to press "Control," "Shift," "Alt" and the letter "N" at the same time.
Your first number will appear as an "A" with a number sign next to it because it is the master page. The other page numbers will appear as numbers.
 When you change the style on the master page "A," it will change all the numbers' styles.
, This will save you time in creating the page numbers on the right side of the pages, instead of going through the whole process again.
 Zoom in on the left and the right. They should appear in order.
