 Use conditioner, wait a few minutes, and rinse it off completely. Rinse your hair with cold water to get a healthy looking shine. Towel dry by wrapping your hair in a towel. Tousling hair with a towel will only create tangles. (No blowdryer or curler/straightener, these damage hair.)









If your hair doesn't need washing, skip this section.;
, Use a wide toothed comb and avoid too much brushing as hair is fragile when wet. It's best to comb out the ends first, then detangle a few inches higher repeatedly until you've done your whole length.
 This can take a while, but it's better for the hair than blow drying. Running your fingers through it periodically and fluffing the roots a little will speed the process.
 This will help create volume.
 However, make sure that the sections are still intact.
, From there, work the brush through your hair to the tip. Do this with each section, one at a time. Remember where the sections were and don't rush. When all sections are brushed, you're done.
 Sleep on it for one night. In the morning, take out the sections and you should have beautiful, shiny, healthy hair!
