 Just simple things like kicking higher is enough. Don't push your self too hard. If you become uncomfortable, stop and rest for a minute. Serious injury can follow if you push too far. You can take a class of gymnastics or yoga to help you.;
, She knew how to defend herself and others. Try taking Martial Arts classes or try WikiHow.
 You need to be ready to defend anyone or anything. Also be prepared. Things in this world can pop up any second. Always have a backup plan!!!

, Stand up for others who need your help and remember to stand up for yourself as well. Do the right thing!

, If she was down she wouldn't throw it onto other people. She kept a smile and joked around in hard times. Buffy frequently showed a sarcastic streak, and has been known to constantly taunt and crack jokes or puns about her opponents, even in the midst of battle. Buffy is unique as a Slayer in that she refuses to give up her "normal" life for her destiny. Buffy was also very stubborn and a natural leader, very commanding and even called bossy. She's also somewhat short-tempered in nature, as it never takes very much to irritate her. For more on her personality go to (http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Buffy_Summers)

,, Get your scoobies (Willow, Xander, Giles, Tara, Anya, Oz, Dawn, Spike, Angel ETC.)

, For Bottoms- Jeans, Skirts, sometimes dresses. In season 4, her signature look was a black tank, red leather pants, and black boots. Make sure the pants aren't too tight, as that can hurt.

 For Make-up: frosted eyeshadow, frosted lip colors, pink lipsticks, purple lipsticks, purple glosses, violet lipsticks, peach glosses, pink glosses, red lipsticks, red glosses, bright turquoise and aqua marines. For Nails: Bubblegum Colored.
