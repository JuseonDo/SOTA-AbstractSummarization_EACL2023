 Visualization as a mean of relaxation and putting things into perspective, will ease what you feel toward anything or anyone. In your mind, go to places you adore, meet special people you love and enjoy the company of, wear the jeans you want to buy, sit and eat your favorite dessert and drink a cup of coffee embracing the view of a marvelous sunset in front of the sea.
 You might not even need to talk directly to that person. You can, as well, text something sweet and honest because you are giving yourself the gift of congratulate that person from a place of non resistance.
 What others do or think will never affect your experience unless you allow so.
