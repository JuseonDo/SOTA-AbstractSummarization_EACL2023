look to see if your temperature gauge is nearing the danger point.

 This tends to happen quickly, so turn off your car as soon as you notice it.
 If the hood is too hot to touch, wait at least 10 minutes before opening it.
 The hose can be very hot, so only touch it for a few seconds with your fingertips. Repeat for the bottom radiator hose.


Both radiator hoses should be very warm to the touch. If one hose is very hot and the other one feels cool or even cold to the touch, the thermostat is likely stuck in the closed position.
