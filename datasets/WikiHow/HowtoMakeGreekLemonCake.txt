, Set mixture aside.
 In a large bowl beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar, beating until stiff glossy peaks form. Set aside.
 Add flour mixture alternately with the yogurt to the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold in the egg whites and pour the batter into the prepared pan.
 Check every 10 minutes when in the oven to ensure that the cake does not burn. During the last 10 to 25 minutes, poke a cake tester in the cake to see if the mixture is cooked. If the cake is cooked on the outside but raw on the inside, lower the temperature and let the cake cook through slowly. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to finish cooling.
