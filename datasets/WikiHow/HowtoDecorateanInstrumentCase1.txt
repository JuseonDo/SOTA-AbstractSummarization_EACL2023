 It can be anything from your name to a bunch of random spirals - let your imagination run wild. You may want to sketch it out on paper first.;
,, Depending on the texture of the case, you may wish to apply a coat or two. Let the white-out dry, and make sure it's completely dry before continuing.
 You can use solid colors, make stripes, or any color scheme and design you'd like. The goal is to completely cover up the white-out, so that you have a nice, even image with the black case in the background.
