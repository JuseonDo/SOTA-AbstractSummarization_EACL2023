, Since this piece will be played as a duet, one person should focus on the lower side of the piano and one on the higher side.
 Using your left hand, you will be playing the keys C, A, F, G in this rhythm:


Double hit C, pause for a second.
Double hit A, pause for a second.
Double hit F, pause for a second.
Double hit G and repeat until your left hand can play this smoothly.
 After each key is pressed twice with the left hand, your right hand should play the the same key that the left hand presses with the one ascending it by two keys.

Left hand double hits G, the right hand double hits G and B.
Keep practicing with both your hands until you play it smoothly and it sounds right!

, You will only need to use your right hand.


Start by pressing the middle C three times.
Wait a second, then hit the C again and continue playing byÂ descending down. Play the keys left of C: B and A.
Now ascend again by playing B, C, D and hit the E three times.
Hit the E once more, then play the two descending keys of it: D and C.
Continue by playing the ascending keys D, E, F and G.
After playing the key G, pause for a second and play the C you initially started at.
Now you're going to wait another second before playing the A key right of the C.
Descend from A by playing G, F, E, D, C, B, A, G, F.
Finish by ascending from F, playing F# (the black key directly to the right of F), G, A, B, and stopping at C. Then repeat!

, Good luck!
