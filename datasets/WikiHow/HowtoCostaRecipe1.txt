, List the items you need for your recipe in a vertical column on a piece of paper or spreadsheet.


Create a spreadsheet if you plan to cost a number of recipes. This can be saved as a template and used for future costing.
 Place these to the right of your "Ingredients" column. They should read "Quantity", "Ingredient Cost" and "Recipe Cost".
 For example, if you need 4 eggs in your recipe, write 4 under "quantity".
 Usually the amount purchased is not the amount used, so you must break the cost down further to arrive at an accurate recipe cost.


Restaurants use the term As Purchased (AP) to determine the purchase price of the amount of the item purchased, such as a carton of eggs or milk.
Restaurants use the term As Served (AS) to determine the price of a single serving of that item.
For example, if you buy a 12 eggs for 3 dollars, then the AP is 3 dollars. By dividing 3 dollars by 12, you find that the AS of an egg is 25 cents. If you plan to use 4 eggs, then that single ingredient will cost $1 for your recipe.
 Using the previous example, you would write 25 cents in this column.
,, Write that number at the bottom of the "Recipe Cost" column, after the ingredients.
 This is sometimes called the "Portion Cost". Done!
