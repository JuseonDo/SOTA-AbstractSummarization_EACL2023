 However, a six-foot high chain-link fence, with two-by-two inch mesh can be effective at keeping cats out of your yard. A two-foot overhang can provide additional protection.
 When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your yard or areas of it that you do not want cats to use as a litter box.


These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs.
 These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear.These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your yard or sections of it that you do not want cats using as a litter box.
 As long as it is low-voltage, it will not harm the cats, only drive them away. The fence can be raised about 4 inches from the ground and still discourage them from using your yard as a litter box. .


Look for electric fencing at hardware or home supply stores. Carefully follow all installation and safety instructions.
Keep children away from electric fencing.
 Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently discourage them from using your yard.


Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enoughâ€”there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats.
 Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them from using your yard as a litter box.
