 The street and mall levels are the most crowded. Depending on holiday seasons and construction periods, you may have to find yourself walking a distance. There are four levels of parking for convenience.
 It may seem like a shopping spree galore, but most stores are high designers or known retailers. Let the kids roam free in the arcade or watch the Koi fish swim on either wing of the mall level. Macy's and Sears are on the opposite sides of the mall from each other, with Starbucks nearby each of them., Performances usually happen around the lunch hours or between 6 and 8 pm. Ala Moana is also known for 4th of July and New Years fireworks, singing talent competitions, and the annual Christmas events., Everything from pizza, Chinese noodles, sandwiches, Hawaiian plates, tacos, and Korean dishes. Some of the food court vendors are open before the actual mall is, but it becomes crowded throughout the day., Known for their nightly entertainment, pupus (appetizers), and drinks, it gets crowded on the weekends. The music can be heard on mall & 3rd floor on the same wing, so have fun while shopping at night.,
