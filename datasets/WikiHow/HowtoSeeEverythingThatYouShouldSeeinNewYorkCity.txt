 If you plan on going to the Radio City Music Hall, a great time to go see a show is during the wintertime, when you can see the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. The crown of the Statue of Liberty has been reopened since 9/11, so visitors can get an amazing view of the city from there, and the same can be said for the Empire State Building.;
, This venue hosts the New York Rangers (hockey), the New York Knicks (basketball), the Ringling Brothers Circus, boxing and wrestling matches, concerts, and shows including Cirque Du Soleil.
 If you are in Madison Square Garden, just go downstairs to Penn Station.
, See the lake, the reservoir, the zoo or a baseball game that's going on.
, Times Square contains many restaurant, shops, and theaters. Times Square is especially fun during New Year's Eve, if you can get there.
 You can skate on the ice rink or stop into Serendipity 3 for their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate or some ice cream. You can also go to the "Top of the Rock," or the observation deck on top of 30 Rockefeller Center, home to NBC and Saturday Night Live.
 You can see shows like The Lion King, Wicked, Billy Elliot, Rock of Ages and other plays.
 There are plenty of them. The best known museums are the American National History Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Both of the museum's exhibits are amazing.
 It is a thrilling experience.
