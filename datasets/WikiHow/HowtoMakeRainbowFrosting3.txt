 Blend and cream well on a medium setting, mixing until the butter is fully whipped, taking about 2-3 minutes., Slowly blend in the powdered sugar on low speed. Blend until the frosting becomes stiff, taking about 2-4 minutes., Blend once more on high speed for about 5 minutes until fully combined and creamy., The amount of bowls depends on how many colors you are creating for the frosting., Mix well using a spoon until the frosting color shows and is vibrant.

Use a clean spoon every time you mix a new frosting color to avoid a grayish color into the frosting from mixing multiple colors.
 Using a spoon, spread equal amounts of frosting all over the piping bag., Close the pastry bag and place any desired piping tip onto it., Using the piping bag, swirl over the rainbow frosting on any other desired dessert. Enjoy the colorful goodness!
