 It should be under "Applications" in the home menu.;
, This will turn on the "Camera Light," which doesn't really do much for you when trying to make a video in the dark, but works great as a flashlight.
 It will drain your battery if you leave it on for too long.
 There, you will find the option to keep the camera light on. After saving your changes, it will warn you that the light will eat up your battery, and ask if you're sure you want to do that. Confirm your action, and now your flashlight should come up with the video camera.
