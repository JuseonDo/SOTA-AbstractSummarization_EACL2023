 Quail eggs are much smaller than chicken eggs, so they require shorter boiling times. The following are the times for different consistencies of boiled eggs:


Boil for two minutes if you want soft boiled eggs with the yolk still runny.
Boil for two and a half minutes for a soft-boiled egg.
Boil for three minutes for a medium boiled egg.
Boil for four minutes for a hard-boiled egg. The yolk will be completely set.
, Set the eggs in the water for five minutes.
 Serve immediately. These eggs can be eaten by themselves, used in recipes or served as a garnish.
