 You can spread the strips on your work surface, sticky-side-up, or you can place them along the edge of your table.


This will give you a simple, square-shaped pouch. It is perfect for holding coins. You can also use it to hold paper money if you fold them up first.
 You should have a sheet of duct tape when you are done. This is part of your duct tape sheet.
 Remember to overlap the edges by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter). Try to align the side edges as much as you can, but don't worry if they aren't perfect. You'll be trimming the wallet down later.
 This will not only get the sheet to the right size, but it will also get rid of any uneven edge.
 Draw the lines using a pen first, then cut along it using a pair of scissors. If you are having troubles drawing a neat curve, use a cup or plate as a template., When you are done, you should end up with a square shape. This is the body of your wallet.
 Each strip needs to be the same height as your wallet. You will be using this to seal the edges. It can be the same color or pattern as your pouch, or it can be a contrasting one.


You can also use narrow/thin/mini duct tape. It is already the right width, so you don't have to cut it in half lengthwise. Simply cut two equal pieces.
 Be careful not to tape down the flap! If you have any excess tape hanging over the top or bottom of your wallet, you can trim it off with a pair of scissors.
 Open up the wallet, and place a Velcro dot on the point of the triangle (or the top center of the curve). Place the other Velcro dot on the corresponding spot on the body of the wallet.
