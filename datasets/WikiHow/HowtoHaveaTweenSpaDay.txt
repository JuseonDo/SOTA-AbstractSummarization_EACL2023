 You won't need all of the supplies, so you may want to get them later.;
, Somewhere like your bathroom works well. You might want some scents and sights. Remember not to get anything too distracting.
 Air dry afterwards and apply lotion. Now is also a good time to put on a robe, slippers, and put up your hair.
 To make one, mix baking soda and water until you have a paste. Then apply in small circles. Wait five minutes before washing off.
 Use honey-oatmeal, puree cucumbers, or yogurt-oatmeal. Apply, then wait 10 minutes before washing off.
 Check hairline, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.
 Dip hands in and hold for 3 minutes.
 Soak fingers for 5 minutes.
 Don't go past the white and be sure to cut straight across.
 Use warm colors for Summer, pastels for Spring, blues in Winter, and Reds in Fall.
 Moisturize after.
