, If it's silicone, there's no need to oil it., The amount you add is up to you but about 1 tablespoon is a good minimum., This will add the flavor., If you don't like salt, you can skip it., Bake for about 5 minutes or until it turns golden brown., Tip the cheesy crisps out of the holes of the cupcake tray or muffin pan. If you want to soak up any grease, leave them to sit on parchment paper for a minute., The cheesy crisps are ready to eat once they've cooled a little. Place them onto a serving plate for ease of eating. Enjoy with a glass of your favorite drink.
