 Shopping: You can buy knitting needles and yarn at any craft store including Hobby Lobby, Walmart, Target, Ben Franklin, Michaels, etc.;
, Are you a fan of dull or vibrant colors? This usually means two or more.
 What kind of material do you prefer - baby soft or sparkly?

, This will ultimately determine how wide you want your width to be. (25 stitches works well.)

, This is the basis for your first row of stitches.
 Let your pointer finger do the work. Slide the needle under the yarn and take it behind the left needle.
 Make sure that the working needle is in the back so that itâ€™s crossing.
 You have now completed one stitch.
 It may feel like you are undoing your stitches by rotating them from one needle to the next, but after three or four rows you will notice your progress and hard work!

, Finished.
