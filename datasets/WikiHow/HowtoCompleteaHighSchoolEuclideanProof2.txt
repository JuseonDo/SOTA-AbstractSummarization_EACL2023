@summary
draw a diagram.

@summary
state the theorem.

@summary
set up the format for a two column proof.

@summary
repeat each of the givens for the first few rows of the proof.

@summary
aim towards the first important intermediate result you found in the preparation stage.

@summary
if the reason is a theorem, be sure to specify which one and why it applies.

@summary
if a theorem has conditions attached to it, you should explicitly show how they are satisfied.

@summary
continue working towards your conclusion by establishing the other key intermediate steps you found in the prep work.

@summary
the last line of the proof should be the desired conclusion.

@summary
optionally, terminate the proof with qed, a box, or some other similar mark.

@article
 This doesn't have to be overly accurate––formally, it isn't required at all, but it usually helps. Name all points, angles, or other features that you intend to refer to in the proof later.
 State the given assumptions, and what you intend to conclude from them.
 Label the left column Statement, and the right column Reason.
 For the reason, write "given." Even if some of the givens aren't needed until later, it can't hurt to list them early.
 Write each step towards that result, and justify each with an appropriate reason. The types of acceptable reasons are small. They include:


Given
Definition
Axiom (or postulate)
Previously proven theorem (or lemma, formula, law, etc.).
 The following methods are usually acceptable:


Restating it. (The three altitudes of a triangle intersect in a single point.)
Referring to it by name. (Thales' theorem.)
Reference to a text. (Theorem 5.3 on page 124.)
By a standard abbreviation. (SAS).
 For example, if your statement is that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, you might use this detailed reason: BC = EF (line 5), <ABC = <DEF (line= 13), <BCA = <EFD (line 16), and the ASA congruence theorem. Where the earlier 5th, 13th, and 16th lines of the proof show prerequisite angle and side congruences for ASA to apply., Make sure that each step follows from the previous ones.
 As with all other steps, justify it with an appropriate reason.
