 You'll need:


An orange top
Black leggings/slacks
Black/dark pen
Eyebrow pencil (optional)
A green face-painting crayon (optional)

, Look at pictures of simple pumpkin faces for ideas.


If you're feeling really ambitious, you can draw lines down the shirt in a subtle brown/black to act as the lines on the pumpkin.
 Using the eyebrow pencil or green face painting crayon, you can draw a large swirl on one or both cheeks to act as the stem on the pumpkin.
