 These are listed below.
 The reason for two holes is to keep the cookie straight when it's on the wreath.

A toothpick, a skewer or a similar tool is ideal for making the cookie holes.
The holes need to be large enough to thread through your chosen threading item.
, Allow to cool before making the cookie wreath., The pattern can be single cookie types or a variety of cookies in a recurring theme. Some ideas include:

A circle of gingerbread men
A circle of stars
A circle of one gingerbread man, one star, one circle, repeat all the way around, etc.
 When threading, push the ribbon through the back of the first hole, across the front of the cookie, and back down through to the back via the second hole. Turn the the next cookies.,,,
