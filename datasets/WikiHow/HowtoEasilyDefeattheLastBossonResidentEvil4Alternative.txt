 Press the "Dodge" button when prompted during his attacks; it will give you a split second to hit the correct button and get out of the way unscathed;
, When he is stunned from a shot to one of these eyes, run up to him and press the button prompted, to climb onto him and stab his main eyeball

, Climb onto the walkway at either end, and press the switch when he is close, to cause the scaffolding to crash onto him

, Wait for Ada to throw you a rocket launcher after you have hurt Saddler badly enough; she will throw it automatically when that threshold has been reached

, Wait for Saddler to approach you, and shoot him with the rocket launcher once to defeat him
