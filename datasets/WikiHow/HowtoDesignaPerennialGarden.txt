 Design a garden that will fit in a space that is no larger than 15’ (4,572 mm) wide x 6’ (1828 mm) deep. That’s enough room to create a 3 season garden and it won’t be an overwhelming chore to maintain it. The initial planning and preparation of a perennial garden is labor intensive; if you attempt to design and plant a large garden, you might get discouraged, both with the planting and the maintenance.;
, Walk around your property and observe the places where you spend the most time, or would like to spend the most time when you are outdoors. You can also walk through your house and look out of all the windows and decide where you would like to improve the view.
 Note the locations of large trees or shrubs and the average amount of sun and shade the spot gets every day.
 Some perennials are virtually maintenance-free once established, but others require diligent, sometimes daily, attention. Still others require full sunlight or partial shade. Look online or find books at your local library or book store that have full color photographs of perennials.
 Don’t reject a favorite site because it has a large boulder or tree that can’t be moved; you can easily plant flowers that will complement natural elements.
 Fill in any gaps with annuals so that you allow your perennials room to expand over the years.
 A minimum of 3 similar plants or a group of a single variety of flowers gives the maximum eye appeal.
 Taller plants should be planted in the background and lower growing flowers should be in the foreground. Sketching out your choices on your design plan will help you visualize what your mature garden will eventually look like.
