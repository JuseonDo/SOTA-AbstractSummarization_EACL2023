 Note that this butter is in addition to the 3 Â½ oz in the recipe. Use a brush to completely coat the inside of the tins you'll be using to bake.









The tins for a fondant are usually 2-3" deep, but you can use whatever size ramekin you'd like, so long as it isn't as big as a full cake or pie plate!;
, This ensures that you have a nice, even coating that prevents the puddings from sticking. Fondants are slightly undercooked (on purpose), and thus prone to sticking if you don't take these steps.
 You want the entire inside tin coated with a nice dusting of cocoa. Tilt and tip the pans around to get it everywhere, then dump out any excess that hasn't stuck.
 You want a nice, medium temperature. This ensure the outsides cook firmly, but the inside stays cool enough to remain gooey and delicious.
 This is the beginning of your double boiler, a quickly made device used to indirectly heat up chocolate so it doesn't burn. The boiling water, not the heat from the stove, provides a gentler, more even heat.
