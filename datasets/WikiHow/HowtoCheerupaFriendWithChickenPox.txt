do whatever they want you to do, such as fluffing pillows, running an oatmeal bath for them, etc.

 Simply say, "I'm coming over." If, for whatever reason your friend protests, hang up and just come over. He/She needs a companion!;
, This means good movies, a comic, food they like and other nice stuff. Go to their house.
 Don't say anything about their appearance or your friend will feel very bad.
 Offer to help out but other than that, just act like your friend is not sick. If your friend asks for sympathy, lay it on heavy. Just have fun. Both of you are missing each other and this is a great time to catch up on all the things you are missing out on.
