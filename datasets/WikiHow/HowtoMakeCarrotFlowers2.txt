 Cut the top and the bottom off the carrot.
 You want a nice, wide base for your flower. Shape one side into a half circle or dome.
 You're aiming for five petal shapes around the outside, which will be attached at the base of the carrot. Use the knife to mark from one point to another (with a curved petal shape, pointing upward).
 Don't go all the way down; leave the bottom attached.
 Be careful not to gouge out too much, but you want your petals to be a nice, thin layer.



Every time that you finish a layer, make sure that each petal is curved, and doesn't have any sharp edges on it.
Repeat those step until you get about 4-6 layers.



Cut that part, and make it shorter than the other layers.
