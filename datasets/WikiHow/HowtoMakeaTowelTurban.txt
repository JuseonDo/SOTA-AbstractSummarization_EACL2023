 Fold in half, and for ease we are going to use the existing finished edge (of course, you could use some bias binding if you wanted). Measure - on the folded side - 23cm (9") up and mark with chalk. From this mark, measure 8cm (3") down (ie, at 15cm). Then go back to your 23 centimeter (9.1 in) mark and measure 8cm (3") across (i.e. 23cm (9") up from edge and 8cms (3") in). In the diagram, the marks needed are shown by purple dots.;
, In terms of the diagram, you'll be connecting the dot on the folded edge to the dot that's further in, then to the outer edge (towards the corner). You can see on the left-hand side of this picture that there are marks at 23 centimeter (9.1 in) from the finished edge, then 8 centimeter (3.1 in) down from that and 8 centimeter (3.1 in) in, and they are connected in a curve.
,,,, Twist hair in the long side, pull up over the top of your head and fasten the elastic over the button.
