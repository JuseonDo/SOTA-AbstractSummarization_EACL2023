 Pre-sliced bread won't work for this method; you'll need to get a loaf of uncut bread.
 Use a spoon to dig a hole into both sides of bread. Place the bread you scoop out int a bowl.
 Use equal parts sugar and bread.
 Scoop in as much as you can fit.
 You could also wrap the entire thing around the middle with duct tape or plastic wrap.
 This exposes the hollowed-out section so the crickets can get inside.
 In the morning, you should have a full loaf of crickets.
