, Pair a metal dragon with a fire dragon, both above level 7. You can also use many combinations of hybrids which contain the elements of both fire and metal. A list of possible combinations is provided just below.


You will need to be at level 17 in the game if using a metal dragon.
The metal and fire dragon combination seems to work best in the epic breeding island.
