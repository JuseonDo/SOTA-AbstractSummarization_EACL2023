 You have to have enough tinder, kindling, and fuel wood. The wood should not be wet or live. Using wet or live materials for fire starting will result in more smoke than fire, so leaves should be avoided at all costs. To test whether the wood is good for fire or not, make sure that when you break the wood, it breaks cleanly. If the wood bends, it is not good for burning.;
, The circle should be at least a 2 meter (6.6Â ft) circle away from trees.
 They should be big rocks, about 2-4 times larger than your fist. These will prevent the fire from spreading. Always when you make an outdoor fire, rocks should be placed around it.
