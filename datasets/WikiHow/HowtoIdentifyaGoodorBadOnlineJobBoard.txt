 Many "iffy" sites will post confusing or contradictory instructions.;
, Things like Captcha, etc.
 Many of these offer you very little in exchange for their fees.
 Some sites were set up solely for the purpose of driving traffic to another for profit site. These re-direct job boards are often neglected and not current.
 A site that is obscure or unhelpful is a waste of your time and a potential scam haven. The following menu options will be standard on a legitimate site.


Resume search by employers,
Job notification,
Efficient content management system,
FREE resume submission,
Resume alert for employers

, If the adds are for products, it may be legit... but if the adds are for multiple OTHER job search or opportunity sites... it should be a red flag that the site is primarily a phishing operation and not likely to be helpful to the serious job seeker.

Site has online popularity and ranking.
