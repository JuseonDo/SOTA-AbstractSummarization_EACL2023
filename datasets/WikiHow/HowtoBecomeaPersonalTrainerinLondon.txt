 It may help to live in or near London. London is expensive to live in. When you are starting off, you may prefer to commute from somewhere cheaper. Watlington in Norfolk is a good option, for example..;
, The industry now has a recognized qualification regulated by REPs (Register of Exercise Professionals). You need a level 3 to become REPS registered as a personal trainer in London. There are many many companies in London offering courses that can get you a REPs qualification. However as with anything some are better than others. Get saving as this can cost anything from £1500 - £5000.
