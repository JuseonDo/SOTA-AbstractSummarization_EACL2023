, Don't draw too far back on the jaw; it's important to leave enough rind at the back of the jaw to support the top of the head.
 When doing this, be gentle, so as to avoid cracking the newly shaped jaw.


Hollow out the top of the head first to cut down on weight.
Insert a large square of yellow watermelon inside the mouth to hold it open and support the top of the head. Don't overextend the jaw as this risks cracking the rind.
 Cut the eyebrows like crescent moons, and cut the nostrils in the shapes of inverted teardrops. Use the channel knife to create the details on the eyebrows and within the nostrils; see the picture for details .
 Cut all the way through the outside of the rind. Attach the eyebrows and nostrils to the head with either toothpicks or a glue gun.


Take the second melon (or any other other colorful fruit) and the leftover flesh from the dinosaur head piece, cut triangular shapes that mimic jagged teeth.
Stuff these bite-sized pieces into the mouth of the dinosaur, filling in around the large square piece that is holding the mouth open.
 Line the top and the bottom of the mouth with the shortened skewers, just inside of the rind, to create the teeth. Place them in with the pointed end facing out, and if needed, use pliers to help secure them in place.
