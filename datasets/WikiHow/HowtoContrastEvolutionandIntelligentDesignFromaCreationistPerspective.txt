@summary
question as a creationist and contrast past events being compiled from rock formations, fossils and inconclusive "evolutionary theory" versus intelligent design in your understanding of creation by god.

@summary
examine—natural events in thousands of interdependent systems based "on" chance—or what?,

@summary
consider some things that may be characteristics of provable, scientific information: man-made or natural, impersonal, observed or tested-observationally and non-dogmatic.

@summary
evolution has not been fully tested observationally by proved, repeated biological events; it is certainly a world view of some.

@summary
believe: if you believe in evolution (not a creator), then (a) something always has existed -- or (b) something apparently came from nothing, and:

@summary
then order came from disorder;

@summary
apparently life came from non-life (and non-life has no genetics or cell division);

@summary
variation is from identical factors;

@summary
intelligence came from no nerve system at all;

@summary
morality from immorality, or from no values concept at all.

@summary

@summary
conjecture about presuppositions of how can a minute nervous system (as a mosquito) be so all encompassing: was it comprehensive by chance, mere mistakes, accidental mutations, life force itself from and by that source: what source, was it nothing but a ball of hydrogen or undifferentiated mass of energy; what?

@summary
,

@summary
look at whether mosquitoes and other tiny creature have millions or billions of interdependent cells that enable interdependent systems so proactive for life but would be formed with exquisite dependencies without any awareness or any plan or any formal sort of logic, really?

@summary
,observe the unobservant processes of evolution that could not realize their own existence, but then are said to have originated life and continued, adding/subtracting by failures (mutations) of the previous genetic system, surviving to breed a new thing, multiplying and thereby passing on, logically, mostly defects of varying degree, combining in such agglomeration that death becomes almost a certainty before ever comes a chance to breed!,

@summary
consider a non-directed process... need it be so?,

@summary
ask yourself how some evolutionists can seriously propose that it was by multiple random failures and chaos that a lifeless, helical chain of chemicals strewn in space with neither semipermeable membrane nor cytoplasm, and, indeed, no cellular environment originated.

@summary
consider "natural selection" which is said to be essential for life and evolution, being due to "pressure" (coincidental stuff).

@summary
evolutionists may determine ponderous questions or accept them as concluded within definitions upon their impersonal, unmotivated theory -- value??,

@summary
examine a limb or wing is presupposed to have started out as a tiny protruding bone or exoskeleton, which then grew out longer in nature.

@summary
realize that such "construction" is much the same case for any type of joint, such as for paws, hands, fingers, articulated joints, and the opposing thumb in more "advanced" creatures ("are we mice/or are we man?").

@summary
research the few fossils that can claim to be a fossil of an "in-between" creature.

@summary
consider that even if there were intermediate fossils, that could allow for thousands of these life forms in fossils to be evolving at various stages for evolution.

What about self-controlled flight of the smallest gnat or mosquito with amazing "piloting" skills—showing very interdependent activity: could that instinctual ability be by intelligent design. "Was transmitting of instinct by chance?" Creationists say it was intelligent design not chance.
Mosquitoes avoid imminent danger. "What danger. Why react if by chance; why phobia, no reason, if no design?"
Precision use of senses for coordinated physical action, simple as crawling or walking or as organized as being coordinated with eyesight"Why is there seemingly quite purposeful actions like motility, travel, feeding, digestion, reproduction, etc. Could that be by purposeful design?" It is to creationists.
 (These are some expectations of many who propose evolution as fact or theory).
 It is related to the mentioned presuppositions and seems nearly dogmatic. Evolution does not meet science's own standards of what has to be found in order to be highly verified data while considering other viewpoints.
,,,, Are there no other choices? How can non-designed, intricate inter-dependencies at every level of life be intricately linked through mutual dependency — "with there being absolutely no driving reason to do so"?, Ask yourself what, indeed, would be the chance of such a contrivance to survive genetically through the eons? How could it ever be possible that evolution not be immune to a sterile, "random chaos" driving mechanism? Evolutionists may argue that all non-directed, undesigned, purposeless features get passed on through succeeding generations (presupposing unplanned origins). Whether or not they are beneficial, as there is no awareness of the process by the genetic system, how would the unrelated parts of a body, leg and/or rudimentary brain now all be correlated, by independent mutations-- billions of "failures" of the previously existing genetic processes corrupted with deadly "messes" from day one. Is it not just as logical that all mutations would be passed on and precipitate a total failure and extinction due to the extreme harshness of the milieu of life? How would anything still be alive at all?

, But, natural selection includes, originally, reproductive genetics from totally non-living material without a reason or known process to begin to truly live with digestion and energy. Modern science hasn't done that (has not formed a functioning, genetic, living cell from basic materials that were not provided by a preexisting life), but ancient dust, water and random stuff could do so?
~ Realize that the thousands and perhaps millions of related, (prerequisite) processes had to exist in exquisite detail, simultaneously before that basic life's previously unplanned formation, could bootstrap its own creation. All spontaneously fleshed out (yet not knowing how or why). It then had to sustain itself all by spontaneous, undesigned/non-purposeful means. Yet, it had to exist successfully (having inadvertently been alive and reproductive by no known means or reason). Then its genetic plans changed, spontaneously, called mutation, "ie: failure" of a previous genetics, map/plan, that had worked ("and it was good").


Study the pressure that brought us into modern life! "It" had selected, trillions of times, and "it" was good? That it is brainless, thoughtless mother nature: "invented" with no ideas; made genetic "blueprints" by anarchy, with no form of governance/not even kindergarten level skills, not even finger paint design capability. It just "used" sterile lava that had eroded into sterile, lifeless dust plus water, acids, bases, salts, static electricity. Dust, mother earth's chemicals were spilling all over, lifeless stuff, life-free watery, primordial-soup of "sterile mother nature" became life, with incredibly, interdependent processes. Life had to "pre-learn" self-maintenance, to feed itself, digestion, reproduction, making instincts before there were suggestions. Starting, basically from "lava-dust soup", in tidal pond or near warm water vents in oceans, primitive, chaotic stress, pressured to "form life". That's the stuff: you see how it worked, chance, from dust to dust; ashes to ashes.
?, Then joints were mapped by genetics, formed for the upper and lower parts of a leg or wing, while growing longer -- eventually forming an extremity, whether scaled, feathered or furry or not. If that joint were even a little bit wrong or out of place there would be no success, extreme discomfort to the bird/bat/mammal... even if the joint could flex and move.
 In essence, this would require: a nervous system, high symmetry, mobility, balancing capacity and coordination.
 "Do they clearly link to the next form.", "Where are these stages to be as conclusive as many claim evolution to be..."
