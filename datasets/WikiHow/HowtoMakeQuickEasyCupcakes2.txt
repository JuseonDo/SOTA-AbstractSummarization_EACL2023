, If you don't have liners, grease the cups using vegetable oil or butter to keep the cupcakes from sticking., In this easy recipe, it doesn't matter in what order you pour them in. Choose a big bowl that will fit all the ingredients.
 Keep stirring until you no longer see dry bits of flour.
 Fill each one 2/3 way full. Leaving extra space will give the cupcakes room to rise without spilling over the rims.
 Test to see whether the cupcakes are done by inserting a toothpick into the center of a cupcake. If it comes out clean, they're ready. If it's still wet, bake the cupcakes for another five minutes.
 Place them on a wire rack or on the counter to cool completely. If you frost them too quickly, the icing will melt off.
