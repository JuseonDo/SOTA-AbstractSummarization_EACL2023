 Make sure you boil enough water in order to make as many cups of tea as desired. Once the water has been thoroughly boiled, carefully pour the water into a heatproof bowl. The size of the bowl will depend on how much water you have boiled.;
, Place the rosehips into the bowl of boiled water. Make sure that the water completely covers the rosehips. If you find that it doesn't, either boil and add more hot water, or use a spoon to push the rosehips down to the bottom of the bowl.
 Do not cover the bowl or disturb its contents.
 Drink the tea immediately, as the water will be cool.
 Do this after the first frosts.
 Remove the top and tail of each rosehip.
 Remove all of the seeds.
, A temperature around 120ºC is appropriate.
, Transfer the blended dried rosehips to an airtight storage container.
, Place in the mug or cup.
 Allow to steep for 5 to 7 minutes, then remove the tea leaf holder.


Alternatively, strain the tea out of the cup if you added it straight.
 Add a little honey to taste, if needed.
