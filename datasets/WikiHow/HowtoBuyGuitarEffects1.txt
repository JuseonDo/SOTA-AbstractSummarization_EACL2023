 (Many effects processors can give you hours of juvenile joy just messing around with them.);
, These are called stomp boxes due to a large steel button the player steps on to turn the effect on or off. There are also floor boxes which feature foot treadles for continuous control of one or more effects.
 All of these types of effects can be referred to as effects pedals. Rackmount effects are meant to be mounted by their front panels into a standard equipment rack. These often come with an associated foot controller. Finally, many modern amplifiers feature built-in effects with controls on the amp's primary control panel or optional floor controllers. There are plenty of other special types of effects that have been used over the years, but the vast majority are simply modifications of one of the categories below.
