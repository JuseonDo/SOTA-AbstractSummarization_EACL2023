 If you want to place your zones outside of an area near a power plant, you must build power lines to link the two together. The game won't accept power lines being built directly over the top of the upcoming needed zones.;
, Don't worry if you zoned high density commercial and you still do not get massive skyscrapers. When the population grows, so will the buildings.
,, The game may create these roads between zones automatically, but it is always good to check.
