@summary
you should have enough hot water to make the dough soft and malleable.

@summary
add enough water until all the flour is absorbed.

@summary
when the flour has finally been absorbed enough by the flour, start kneading it with your fist.

@summary
when you are finished, the dough should be pliable and elastic.

@summary
after the allotted time, the dough will be elastic.

melt enough lard in the pan to allow the fry bread to cook.

@summary
squeeze off a neat ball of dough and gently flatten it out with your fingers, rotating it in a circle, starting with the edges.

@summary
roll it out into a neat circle, making sure the thickness is even.

@summary
when you have rolled it out enough, carefully place the rolled-out dough into the pan with your fingers.

@summary
poke a hole in the center of the dough after you drop it in.

,, Yes, add it to the flour.
 Distribute it as best as you can.
 It should be hot, but bearable to the skin. Have someone pour the water in for you. This step is important! While the water is being poured into the flour, use your dominant hand to squeeze the mixture, letting it ooze between your fingers. Let the dough mix itself. Do not try to knead it yet.
 It should be sticky, but not watery. Continue to squeeze it. There should be no pockets of dry flour. All of it should be absorbed.
 Punch the dough. Fold it inwards from the edges over and over. Add flour or warm water when necessary, a little at a time, rotating the bowl as you knead.
 There should be no bumps in the dough, which indicate pockets of flour. Cover it with a towel and let rise for about 30 to 45 minutes.
 It should not be the consistency of thick clay.
 It should not be too hot, or else the frybread will cook too fast and burn easy.
 Explaining how to flap the dough like a Navajo is a bit complicated, and takes practice, therefore I suggest you roll it out instead with a rolling pin.
 Thickness varies. The thinner the frybread, the crunchier it will be.
 Do NOT DROP it into the pan, the hot oil will splash!

, Cook it until it is GOLDEN BROWN on either side. You will know if it's overcooked when it turns a darker brown color with black spots. Use a tined fork to turn it over. That's the Navajo way.
 Popular toppings include salt, honey, powdered sugar, etc. It's great for any meal.
