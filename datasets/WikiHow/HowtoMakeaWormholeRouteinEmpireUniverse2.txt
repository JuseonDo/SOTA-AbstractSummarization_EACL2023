write down the systems id of the origin and target systems you want to travel.go to starsystem view and type in the coordinates of the origin system

@summary
move in a spiral pattern through nearby systems, taking notes of wormholes you see.

@summary
do the same spiral pattern around the target system.

@summary
compare both lists and check if there are any single or pair of wormholes that end close to each other.

@summary
for three or more jumps, you will have to check the neighborhood of exits of wormholes.

,, Use the right mouse button to rotate the star system so you can read the tiny names of the wormholes in the back.


For the spiral pattern, you go up once, right once, down twice, left twice, up thee systems, right three systems, down four systems, left four systems, up five systems and so on.
Do that till you are going up on the count of seven or nine. Finish this side, and you will have tracked a range of three to four parsecs around the origin system.
 Remember to take notes of what system the wormhole is in, and where does it link.



Usually this method yields a route of 6 to 8 parsecs across, with two jumps.
 See if you can find a third wormhole linking one from the origin to one from the end. The idea is the same, finding wormholes that end close to each other to make a path.
