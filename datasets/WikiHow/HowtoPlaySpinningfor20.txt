 The size of the circles will vary with the size of the board. Make sure to copy the numbers as well.;
, Each spool makes two tops which are spun with the thumb and forefinger. A penny or cent may be used to spin, in fact any small thing that spins will do for a top.
 The number of the circle the top stops on, is the number scored. If it lands on a line, it counts for the circle next it. If it lands on the outside of the line of circle 5, it counts nothing.
 Any number of people can play and any number, such as 100 or more, may be the scored.
