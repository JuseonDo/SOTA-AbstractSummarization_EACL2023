, This is usually the best option, because this part is generally biggest and will give you room for all your binders, even once they've been filled with papers.
 You may also want to place your calculator in this section. Once you begin the year, your novels and smaller textbooks will also fit very nicely.
 Depending on what you're interested in, you may want to put a small novel, makeup, cell phone, iPod, etc. It's mainly up to your school.
