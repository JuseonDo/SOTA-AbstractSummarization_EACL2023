@summary
if you have a basket that you really like and it's not doing much, fill it with your ribbons.

@summary
alternatively, leave the ribbons loose in the basket.
@article
 Wind them onto card or leave on their rounds and simply add to the basket in a nice pile.
 This will look pretty. However, the only issue with this is that the ribbons may become entangled.


Don't put anything else other than ribbons in the basket.
