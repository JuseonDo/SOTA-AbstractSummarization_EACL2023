, That way, you won't have to find it again and to prevent it from being killed by zombies.
 Make sure to harvest only enough for seven trades.
 After making a single trade seven times (seven emeralds total) the trade will instantly disappear a new one will take its place.
 Don't use fists, arrows, or potions, as they cause the iron golems to attack and they are very powerful and hard to kill. After you kill the villager, there will be room for a new baby villager to spawn, and it may have another useful trade.
 If none of them have good trades and are not breeding, doing this will mean the remaining three quarters of the population will repopulate the lost fourth and the new villagers may have better trades.
