 That's always a good time! Explore on YouTube or Netflix for some movies or TV shows that you have never seen, and find favorites together.;
,


Read to your teddy bear and bond over family favorites.
 Board games are extremely fun. Like Monopoly, snakes and ladders, checkers, etc. Let the bear win occasionally, don't be greedy.
,


Give your bear a blog of its own, so that it gets to meet other teddy bears and become friends with them.
 You can imagine that teddy bears love to get hugs and kisses.
, Tuck your bear in at night, every night.
 Even to the movies, just the two of you. Remember to watch something your companion might like.


Go to the park with the bear. Parks are fun! Go walking, go on the playground, slicky slide, carousel, etc. Remember to bring the bear home again.
 You might find it a little embarrassing, but it's just until your bear is settled. But by then you will be happy to do anything with your stuffed friend.
 When you're going to camp or somewhere far like a trip or voyage, take your friend! Even pack them a little bag. Take them trick or treating and give them a costume from Build A Bear Workshop!

, Find new foods and find favorites together.
 It's not hard to believe that teddies love candy shops, since you do too. Indeed, a bear loves what you love.
 Do not drop it or it'll get dirty and you might have to wash it!

, Probably the most fun thing to do is to have a slumber party or sleepover with your teddy bear. You can watch a movie, stay up late, maybe even do some prank calls to other bears. If you'd like, bring some other friends with their bears. Have fun, make bracelets, and eat snacks.
, Your teddy will probably always want to be with you.


Take you teddy bear everywhere with you if possible.
