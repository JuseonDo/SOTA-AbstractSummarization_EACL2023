the first step is to know what your leveling up.

@summary
next, you need to know where you stand.

@summary
method one: start "a rat problem" at the anvil fighter's guild.

@summary
method two: this method is not as effective as method one and will probably take you a lot longer to raise your level.

@summary
method three: if you aren't relying on quests or add-ons, go to the sewers in the imperial city and collect rats as in method one.

 If 'block' is one of your major skills, this will work best for you.;
, If you are not in the fighters guild, I suggest you join. If you have not yet completed the "A Rat Problem" quest, then method one will work well for you.
 Make your way to Arvena's home and speak to her. When she is done, enter her cellar and kill any mountain lions there. Bring up a shield, weapon, or your fists and attack each one of the rats once. Then block and let them all attack you. DO NOT KILL THE RATS. Once all of the rats are dead, you won't have anyone to help you raise your block level. The next time you speak to Arvena, she will call off the quest since all of her "poor babies" are dead.
 First, you will have to purchase the "Battlethorn Castle" add-on from the marketplace if you haven't already. It's a little pricey, but worth it. Once you have your castle and have bought/restored your fighting room in the basement, you will get a sparring partner. Ask him to fight you with any weapon of your choice, and then block him the entire time. It is not as effective as the first method, as it will cost you a little money and time.
 (The Elven Gardens and Arboretum are good entrances.)
