, This will help prevent you from getting involved with any seller who offers units that have been subjected to anything more than a cursory inspection and increase the chances of purchasing a system that will last for several years.
 Even something as simple as the number of USB ports should be considered as part of the evaluation. Actively look for features above and beyond the ones you consider essential and determine if those other features could possibly be useful at some point.
 Use online and offline sources to gather information from past buyers with a focus on how easily the purchases were made and how the units performed once they had been purchased. This will help you determine if what you hear about those strict re-certification standards are actually true.
 Some off lease computers will come with a basic warranty that is good for anywhere from a few months to a calendar year from the date of purchase. Take the time to look closely at the terms of those warranties and identify the ones that offer the greatest level of protection during the warranty period.
 Buying off lease is about acquiring the best laptop or desktop for the most competitive price. Settle on the computer that has all the features you want, comes with some type of warranty that you find acceptable and has the best price.
