, This recipe makes a small cake in a serving size suitable for your dog and a friend. If you have more canine guests, you'll want to double the recipe.
 Place all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly until the batter is smooth and creamy., Use the back of the spoon to smooth the top of the batter.
 Test to make sure the cake is ready by sticking a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. If it's wet, give the cake a few more minutes.
 Once the cake is cool, invert it onto a plate for serving.
 You can sweeten it with a little honey if your dog has a sweet tooth.
