@summary
at level 9 make sure to buy the spell light healing (exura) for 175 gp.

@summary
after purchasing exura, knights should find a place with many rotworms in order to gain skill.

@summary
druids and sorcerers should get rods or wands respectively, and buy exura as soon as possible in order to raise their magic level, so they can do more damage with runes and heal more hit points.

@summary
at level 10 all vocations should buy ‘antidote,’ which heals poison.

@summary
at level 11, druids, sorcerers and paladins should buy the spell 'intense healing' (exura gran) which heals about double as much as light healing.

@summary
,

@summary
now you should be all right until level 14, unless you want to purchase a good light spell.

@summary
at level 14 all mages should immediately get the ‘magic shield’ spell (utamo vita) and upgrade your wand/rod.

@summary
by this level, you should be at least hunting cyclops or creatures that give around 100 experience.

@summary
get to level 20 like this.

@summary
at this stage you should be considering premium.

@summary
at level 23, sorcerers should keep hunting monsters and try not to die.

@summary
at level 25, buy summon creature spell (utevo res 'creature name').

@summary
you'll gain good loot from doing this, and quite a bit of xp.by now if you really want to be good, you'll have brought premium and can go on hunts with groups of people or you can buy a whole heap of preemie spells which will enhance your hunting in making it easier an faster to level

@summary
,

@summary
by now, you can hunt anywhere in the non premium land- even farther if you actually bought premium.

@summary
at level 45, premium or not, sorcerers should get sudden death rune.

@summary
at level 80 you should have worked out the game.100 + do the annihilator quest and try the poi quest

, Use a weak weapon like a knife, club or sickle. Paladins would do best using small stones. A shield, such as those you might find in Rookgaard, is also recommended.
 At this stage you could kill something stronger than rotworms but make sure you have a good escape plan (and try not to get killed).
 (This is strongly recommended, as you will likely be facing poisonous creatures, such as scorpions, centipedes, and slimes soon.)

,, In which case, get ‘Great Light’ at level 13 or get a newer rod/wand.
 Paladins can get it now or later. It comes in handy when you are in danger as any damage inflicted upon you will be subtracted directly from your mana points instead of hit points. (Mages should use this sparingly, however, because it can very quickly subtract mana points that may be needed later.)

, (Slimes work just as well, as Cyclops can be difficult to kill at lower levels.)

, At level 20 the first thing you should do is the 10 k quest which will give you 10 k and some other items (beware of player killers who kill you after you receive the 10k). Also be sure to buy the ‘Ultimate Healing’ spell (exura vita).
 It helps HEAPS, it gives you more spells, hunting areas, runes and you can buy a vocational promotion for 20 k. It isn't required, though.
 Druids can buy it but its recommended that druids go to level 24 an get Ultimate Healing Rune (adura vita). Make backpacks of these runes as they sell for around 3 k on most servers. If you really want to get a high magic level, use your money to buy mana fluids, as they will speed up your magic level considerably.
 Now you should be able to hunt dragons, but take some Intense Healing Runes, just in case. Summoning 2 Demon Skeletons can help you considerably. Monks work just as well at higher levels, as they can heal themselves. Paladins can get this spell as well, but it won't help very much

, Once you've gotten to around level 35, you should be able to solo dragons and/or giant spiders without summons. Knights should also get Berserk if they have premium and a promotion

,, A good spot is Orc Fort or POI or The Second Floor of DC (Dark Cathedral)

, It’s the strongest rune in the game an it sells for 5-6 k per backpack.
 You can kill almost anything
