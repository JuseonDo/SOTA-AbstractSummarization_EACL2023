 It is very important to figure this out now so your whole plan doesn't fail later.;
, If so, go out and buy them now to save time later.
 Your pastor is the best person to go to because he does preach several times a week.
 Your fliers should inform those interested: where the sessions will be held, when the sessions will be held, a contact number, a brief schedule, and whether or not you will be providing Bibles, notebooks, pens, and folders for the Bible study.
 If they say yes be sure to tell them they are welcome to bring as many people along with them as they like.
 The key to having a good sermon is inspiration and an outline. Be sure to create an outline and make enough copies of it to give to everyone at your Bible study.
 That means tables, chairs, (optional) Bibles, notebooks, pens, and folders.
 Or you can also just sit them on a table and let them grab them as they walk by the table.
, Let them know your name and maybe a little about yourself.
 You may speak the prayer or ask the people to say their own prayer in their heart.
 Be sure to quote the Bible when you speak your sermon. After all, it is a Bible study.
 If you want to keep them so they don't get lost then ask them to keep them where they are, but if you don't want to keep track of them tell them to take them home and bring them back the next time.
 You may speak the prayer or ask the people to say their own prayer in their heart.
