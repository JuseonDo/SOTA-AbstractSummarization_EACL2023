 Choose a color that looks like the sky and also goes well with the accessories you will use to decorate the room. It is best to use a paint with a satin finish. Apply a second coat of paint if needed.;
, You are going to want to practice making clouds on a board, before you actually paint on the walls.
 Wait for the walls to dry completely.
 You will mix 4 parts glaze to 1 part white paint in a paint pan.
 Play with cloud formation until you are confident you are ready to paint clouds on the actual wall.
 You do not want to paint it directly in the center of the room. Start by finding the exact center, then moving over and up 1 foot (30 cm).
 Dab any excess glaze off in the paint pan. Begin forming the clouds by dabbing the sponge in a straight line to form the bottom of the cloud. Continue up from the line, dabbing and twisting the sponge to form a cloud. You want the clouds to be denser toward the middle and thinner toward the edges.
 Wring out excess water. Use the cheesecloth to soften the edges of the cloud.
 You'll also want to add some wispy clouds in between larger clouds. Clouds should be light and airy looking. Try to be random with the placement of your clouds, just as they are in nature.
 Also, let some of your clouds continue around a corner.
