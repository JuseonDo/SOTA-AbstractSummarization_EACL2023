 Shellac can be purchased from hardware stores and some craft stores.
 Add a little denatured alcohol to the shellac before painting it on. While doing this is likely to work best, if you wish, you can use just plain shellac.
 Allow to dry, preferably by hanging or sitting on a wire drying rack.

If preferred, the shellac can be sprayed onto the items. This can be useful where they're very delicate.
