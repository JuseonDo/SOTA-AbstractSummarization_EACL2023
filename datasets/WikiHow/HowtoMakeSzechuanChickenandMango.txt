 And if you don’t have one, no sweat, a large skillet would do. Add two tablespoons of canola and get it nice and hot.Then add a few holes Szechuan peppers about 3 to 5 and in rapid succession, add your garlic, ginger and your jalapeños.

 Then pour it into a serving bowl and top it with the scallion green and chopped cilantro.All done.
