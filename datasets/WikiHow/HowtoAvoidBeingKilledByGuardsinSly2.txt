 As often as possible, use Sly's Rail Walk/Slide and Ninja Spire Jump/Landing. Stick to the rooftops, where you'll be less likely to get caught.;
, Very, very careful. Bentley's strongest attacks, at first, are his sleep darts and bombs. If caught by guard(s)do not try to fight them, unless you've got an upgrade to help. Bentley swinging his crossbow is not very strong.
 Murray is extremely strong, so he will be able to fight most guards head-on. Just remember: His health bar isn't a bottomless pit.
