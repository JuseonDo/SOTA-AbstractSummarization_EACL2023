 You have broken God's Law (the 10 commandments). You must understand that you are a natural-born-sinner, and deserve God's punishment for your selfish ways. Although, you must also take into consideration that certain groups of Jesus' early followers did not see things this way.;
, He willingly took the punishment for you while you were like a stranger and like an "enemy."

, Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins and surrender your life to Him. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead and you will be saved. "All things can work out for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to God's purpose." You can start to gain ground as a Brother of Jesus, and your ways can be in the light beyond the tunnel.



Confessing with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and agreeing with Jesus means: be born again of water and the Spirit to enter into the kingdom of God. (John 3:5)

, Then follow up that with readings in the Bible, the Holy canon. Come to realize that there have been several books deemed sacred by some that were abandoned in the process of canonization by agreement to the consistency of doctrine and to the historical accuracy.
 You may want to start a Ministry of Holy Spirit for ALL who believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ, believing that all good Churches are one and the word of God is one for ALL generations.
,, "And when you pray, use no vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." (Matthew 6:7). Believe and accept that God already knows and cares...
