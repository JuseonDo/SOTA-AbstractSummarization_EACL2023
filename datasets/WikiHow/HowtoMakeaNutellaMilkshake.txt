, Add one more tablespoon of Nutella if you want your milkshake to be sweet, and put in one less tablespoon of Nutella if you enjoy it more milky.



If you prefer a different type of flavor, you could add in whipped cream, powdered sugar/powdered chocolate, Cadbury flakes/proper chocolate.
For a variety of flavors in your milkshake, add all the above into the blender.

Although it may take a little longer, make sure your blender is turned onto the middle button for a smoother, thinner milkshake.
If your blender has a special milkshake mode, make sure it is turned onto that before you start blending it.
Be sure not to blend the ingredients for too long as the milkshake will become too aerated.
 Once it is in your mug, add more whipped cream/ice cream, cinnamon/powdered sugar, and chocolate if these additions are desired.
