 A multi-pack has coarse to fine grit cloths, which will aid in smoothing the edges. The emery cloth is preferred over sandpaper because it is easier to run around the edges.


If you canâ€™t find emery cloths, buy sanding blocks that are wider than the object.;
, Wear gloves to minimize contact with your hands.
 Hold it steady.
 Work for about 10 to 20 seconds on each inch, and then move along the rest of the edge.
 Then, repeat with a fine-grit emery cloth.
