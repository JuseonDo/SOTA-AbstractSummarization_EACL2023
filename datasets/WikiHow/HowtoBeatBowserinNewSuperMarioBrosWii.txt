@summary
jump on the platforms, until you get off screen.

@summary
jump on the platforms, avoiding bowser's claws trying to swipe you down.

after the third platform, you will see a gigantic button (with peach still in a cage right above it).

After you go through the door, you need to go down the corridor. Watch out though, Bowser is breathing fire balls at you as you progress through the hallway!;

Bowser will roar for a few seconds, and then he will start throwing spiked hammers at you. Since he only throws one way (he throws them at the entrance), you just need to get closer to Bowser and you'll be fine.
When Bowser jumps, it's your chance! Go behind Bowser and press the button! Bowser will make a scene starting to groan, then the bridge will collapse. After that happens, Princess Peach's cage is suddenly pulled off screen. Mario starts automatically trying to jump after her, until he sees that there are moving platforms.
 After you get up high enough, the Koopalings will come in their Koopa Clown Car and use their magic wands to enlarge Bowser (who is still unconscious on the floor). Then the real finale begins.



Watch out for the Bowser head statues against the wall! They blow fire at you!
There are basically three different mini levels between each moving platforms. Each little level gets a teensy bit harder.
 Press the button and you've done it! Congratulations!You can also take risks to save peach.
