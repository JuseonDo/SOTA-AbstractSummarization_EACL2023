fasten the clothespin with the cord attached to the hanger with many clove hitches.

connect the neck of the hanger to the horizontal rod directly below it to keep that rod from sagging.

  Buy wire hangers that are exactly as shown and for good reason: thin hangers allow maximum loading. Get the large size wooden clothespins, they will not break and be durable. Avoid a small diameter cord because it will tangle easily and also avoid using a large diameter cord because a large cord will interfere with the function of the clothespin. Use clear nail polish, fabric glue or some other waterproof glue to keep the cords in place on the hanger and to keep the knots from unraveling.;
, A thin wire hanger by itself will be weak, so two is preferable. 

, One at a time, fasten a clothespin to the doubled-up hanger. Fasten the cord to the clothespin first with a noose knot on the spring hole. Cinch the noose knot to the spring hole and make additional simple knots for good measure. If the cord is too thick, the clothespin will not open and close easily.  If the braided line has its breaking strength labeled, buy some line that is between 25 - 75 pounds.
 Top off the clove hitches with some sliding knots (these sliding knots are not fixed and will tighten from the hanging load on the clothespin). Tie the cord to the hanger tight so it will not slide sidewards.  The knot to the hanger also binds the two hangers together.  Keep the length of the cord between the hanger and clothespins to about three inches.
 Attach the cord to the top of the hanger first and then to the horizontal rod (it will be easier to adjust the cord length when doing it in this order).
, Also use the horizontal rod to drape small items on, this is a feature that typical drying racks do not have.
