 This won't work if FNAF2 is open.
 This will bring you to a folder that contains the app settings and data files that are associated with the apps on your computer., There will be a lot of files in this folder--the one you want is a folder called "MMFApplications." Find it by scrolling through the files or press Ctrl+F and type "MMFApplications" in the search bar.


When you find MMFApplications, open the folder.
 Select "Open with" from the pop-up menu and choose Notepad.
, You will now have access to "Custom Night" and "Night 6." You will also have all the "Plushies" and all three stars.
