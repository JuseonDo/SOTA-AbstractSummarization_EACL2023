 Give him or her a good amount of attention by means of hugs, kisses and pats.;
, Ensure there is sufficient water in the stall or paddock as horses can drink upwards of 20 liters (5.3 US gal) of water a day, more when it is warmer.
 This time should be spent giving lots of attention and giving good quality grooming sessions. This gives you the opportunity to bond with your horse.
 Go to its paddock with a book and read, or listen to some music or draw. This will give your horse time to adjust to you and he or she will become interested in what you are doing and he may even want to join in.
 Don't give too much as he or she will already be stressed by the transition, a big feed can cause an upset in their gut. Ensure there is plenty of water for the night check any rugs or boots you may have on your horse. It may be a good idea to use stable boots (similar to float boots) during the night if the horse is a bit tense being in a place. Alternatively, paddock the horse during the daytime and leave him or her there overnight. Ensure the horse is paddocked during daylight so he or she can see become familiar with its surroundings.
