sometimes people don't have to put you down.

@summary
think about when you've been at your happiest, when a lovely boy/girl who ticks all your boxes is smiling at you and hanging off every word you say or when you've been walking around feeling like you were ten foot tall because you'd just achieved what everyone said could not be done.

@summary
when you've done this, read through it all again and again until you remember every moment of it.

@summary
there has to be some goal you've been wanting to achieve but never got round to it because you put it off till tomorrow or never-never.

@summary
ignore the voices in your head or the ones who put you down.

@summary
life is too short, when you want to do something, do it.

 It can be as simple as feeling that you're lacking something, be it love from someone or great friendship. You walk around and see someone who has exactly what you're looking for and your mood is ruined. Sit down! Get some pen and paper and do as follows:;
, What had you been doing for the days/ weeks before? A new exercise programme that made you look and feel ace? A project at uni or school that really showed off your talents? Write them all down.
 Believe this: the best moments and times you always remember in great detail, simply because they by far outweigh the negative.
 Just do your research, you're on the Internet already so you have no excuses for a lack of information! Read, read, read and get your head around what you have to do. If it's karate, get to your nearest class ASAP - don't put it off till next week, you could be dead by then. If you want to learn Chinese, get yourself to a class or go on a learner's website. Whatever it is, you can learn it because. if you know about it enough to want to emulate it, that means somebody else has done the same thing. And if they can, why can't you?

, Just get out there and do it. The beginning is always the hardest but look out foe every improvement you make or complement you receive. The reason why genuinely happy people who love themselves are the way they are is because they're only listening to one voice, their own. Other people do not live inside you so are they qualified to tell you what you can do or what you know? You know the answer already so believe that instead of people who have no idea about your life.
 Then think about how you would feel about this ten years from now, by which time you could be in a loving relationship with a new ability and a stronger sense of self-love than ever before. Is that incentive enough? You decide.
