 Why would a calcium supplement help? Researchers believe that when your calcium intake is low, your body may start craving foods rich in calcium. Many foods that are high in calcium are also high in fat and calories (such as ice cream and cheese). But the women in the study who were getting the calcium supplement (600 milligrams per day) lost more weight and more body fat while taking the supplement., Hereditary ratios of Omega 3 to Omega 6 are thought to be 1:1. However, the typical American diet has skewed this to as much as 1:20. This can result in constant hunger.
