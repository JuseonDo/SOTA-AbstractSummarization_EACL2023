 You can buy one that's already made, or you can take an old shoe box and decorate it with scrap booking paper, gems, glitter glue, stickers, colorful duct tape and so much more, which is cheaper than buying one and you can have lots of fun making it. You could even write your name in cursive on the top in colourful puffy paints!;
, You could make a list, and then put the items on the list in your travel box. But remember, if you plan on bringing a lot of things, be sure your box is deep enough.
,, Even buy some mini board games or make up your own!

, Another good thing to add is tissues for your nose. You never know when a nosebleed might strike!

, Made add savory things like chips or carrots, or, if your sweet tooth is acting up, add chocolate or a cookie.Be sure to add water or a sports drink as well. There's nothing worst than being thirsty on a hot, long, summer car ride with nowhere to stop. Remember, if you're going on more than one trip and you will be using your box on all of them, throw out the old snacks and put in new ones. If it's a hot day, don't add chocolate because it will melt all over your kit. If you absolutely must, put it in a sandwich bag and make sure it's sealed.
