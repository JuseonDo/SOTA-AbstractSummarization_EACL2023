 Times when you might want a "before" shot include:


An area before a major cleanup; like an oil spill, construction, destruction, etc.
When going on an improved, or at least different, health regimen, whether it is to gain, or lose, weight.
Renovating a house
Cleaning a house (sometimes, people just don't believe it was really that dirty!)
For litigation...you just never know.
 You might need to clean it up a bit if it is a construction project or not, if it is a cleanup project.
, You will regret it if you don't. You will need them for reference later.
 Look at them and make sure that they will serve the purpose and are in focus.
 If it is a long term project then you might want to have a 'before' shot hanging around so you can see your progress.
 Try to take these shots at the same, or similar, angles.
