 Line it with aluminium foil and spray the foil liberally with non-stick cooking spray.;
, Sprinkle the gelatin and let it sit and dissolve for at least 5 minutes.
 Stir to dissolve the sugar and insert a candy thermometer.
 Brush down the sides occasionally with a wet pastry brush to avoid crystallization. While the candy cooks, briefly run the mixer on low to ensure that the gelatin and puree is well refined.
 Turn the mixer to low, and slowly pour the hot syrup into the mixer bowl. Be careful, as the syrup is extremely hot. If you have a large (at least 3 cup) liquid measuring cup with a spout, you can transfer the hot syrup to the cup before pouring to make it easier.
 Whip the marshmallow mixture for 10 minutes, or until it is stiff and shiny. You can tell it is done when you stop the mixer and lift up the beater, and the marshmallow will slowly drip back down into the bowl in a thick, shiny stream.
 Allow it to sit and firm up at room temperature for at least 10 hours.
 Cover your workstation with waxed paper to protect it, and liberally sprinkle the surface with the sugar/starch mixture. Sprinkle the top of the marshmallow with the sugar/starch coating, and flip the marshmallow face down onto the prepared surface.
 Spray a large smooth-bladed knife with nonstick cooking spray, and coat both sides with the coating powder. Cut the marshmallow into squares, coating the knife blade with sugar/starch as needed. Roll the cut edges of the marshmallows in the coating mixture so that all sides are smooth and not sticky.
 To save the marshmallows, store them in a dry airtight container in a temperate, dry location. Do not refrigerate them or keep them in a very humid place. If they are stored longer than two or three days, you may need to re-roll them in the coating. Fresh marshmallows go stale after about a week, so these are best eaten soon after they are made.
