 Generally, they recommend that you paint fiber-cement siding within 90 days of installation, so that it adheres properly before being exposed to all weather conditions. Concrete siding differs greatly depending upon the composite mix, so follow these instructions as closely as possible.;
, If it is un-primed, you will need to buy and use a primer over all surfaces of the siding. If it is pre-primed, you can skip this step and go straight to the paint job.
 The manufacturer may recommend certain type of paint. The store may be able to give recommendations as well.
 Bring house and siding measurements to the store where you plan to buy the paint so that they can help you to calculate how much paint, primer and topcoat are needed. The following are good tips for paint shopping:


Flat paint is more likely to gather dust and mildew.
Satin topcoats may look blotchy compared to other finishes.
Paint that contains polyurethane may achieve a more durable and attractive look. It may negate the need for a topcoat as well.
 Some places may need more than 1 coat of putty. Allow the putty to dry thoroughly, according to package specifications, before moving along to the next steps.
 Make sure to remove all dirt from crevices. Allow the house and siding to dry for 2 to 4 days before starting to paint.
 Apply 1 to 2 coats, using paint brushes to ensure you get in all the crevices of the siding. Allow it to dry according to the product's instructions.
 If you started with pre-primed siding, you can go straight to painting after the siding is clean and dry.
 This may depend upon the paint you chose and the climate in your area.
