, Don’t over think it: look at the picture and make an instant decision. If you love it, cut it out and put it aside.
 For example, you could have 1 pile labeled “casual,” one pile labeled “work” and one pile labeled “formal.”

Does your casual category predominantly contain pictures of velour jogging suits or blue jeans?
Are the blouses and tops frilly or tailored?
Is everything loose and flowing or tight and close-fitting?
The answers to these questions should help you identify your personal style.
