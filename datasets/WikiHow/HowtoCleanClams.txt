Clams may have already been cleaned; however, it may not be as thorough a job as you might expect. Give the batch a once-over to determine whether or not you will be purchasing any.
Some clams will be closed, while others may be slightly open. Tap on them to see if they automatically close. If they respond, they are alive. Do not choose any wide open clams, as they are more than likely dead.;
