 Use a paintbrush or cloth to apply the ketchup to the surface of the kettle. Make sure the texture of the bristles or cloth is smooth. Otherwise, you could scratch the kettle.
 Ketchup contains acetic acid, which reacts with tarnish to dissolve it.Although some acids can damage copper, acetic acid is weak enough to pose no threat.
 Use a smooth cloth or sponge, and move in the direction of the grain of the copper to avoid scratching. The kettle should look marvelously clean again.
