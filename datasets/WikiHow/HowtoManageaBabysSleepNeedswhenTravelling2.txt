 If you are intending to travel by plane or if you are going to a country which has a significant time difference, it is worth planning ahead, so that you can minimize any disruption to your baby's, and your, sleep.
 In preparation for the flight, if possible:


Reserve a bassinet, or find out the policy on taking baby car seats on board.
 Fresh unopened sachets are easier to use and pre-measured for convenience. It's wise to get a doctor's note giving you permission to take it on the plane.
 If your baby is old enough (4 months plus) buy some dried organic apple rings. Hook one onto their thumb which will prevent boredom by allowing sucking and chewing. This will also help with ear pressure changes. Alternatively, use a dummy or pacifier.
, A light, roomy bag with lots of compartments will help you feel organized and in control.
, This will help to ease the pressure in their ears, as well as preventing dehydration.
 Regardless of the time difference, feed at the usual times as far as possible. If you need a bottle to be warmed, ask well in advance.
 When awake, walking up and down will help, also, pointing out things in a suitable in-flight film and allowing them to play with a few safe objects. Don't bother packing too many toys though; your baby will soon get bored with them!
