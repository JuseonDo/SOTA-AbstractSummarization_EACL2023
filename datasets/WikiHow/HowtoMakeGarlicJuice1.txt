@article
 The number of cloves your head has will vary depending on the size and variety of garlic, but a medium-sized head will usually produce around 10 cloves.;
, The flat side, which was closest to the "heart" or center of the head, should face down, and the curved side should face up.
 Keep the clove of garlic in between the center of the blade and the handle, with the handle slightly closer than the center of the blade. The sharp cutting edge should face outward.
 Don't be afraid of striking the clove too hard. You should strike with enough force to smash the clove, removing the skin in the process. Be careful to avoid cutting yourself on the knife, however.
 Strike the garlic cloves with the flat side of your knife until each one is peeled.
