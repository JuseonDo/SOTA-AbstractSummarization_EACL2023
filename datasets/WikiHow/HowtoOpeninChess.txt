 These moves are all reliable and common:


1.e4






1.d4






1.c4






1.Nf3





;
,, Try developing by giving threat to your opponent so that his/her move is wasted while defending. Meanwhile, you can develop your own piece in your next move.


Keep an eye on controlling the center with your pieces. The center is the place where most of the action will be.
Develop with gain of time by attacking your opponents unguarded pieces and pawns.
 For example, a bishop is bad if it is trapped by pawns of the same color as the bishop. If your center pawns are on white squares and your bishop is trapped behind them, try to exchange the bishop for a well-placed piece of your opponent's.
 You might beat beginners with early mates, but not masters. So develop, rather than attempting premature attacks.


Don't go pawn hunting in the opening (unless it is a center pawn) because it wastes time and will probably put you in an underdeveloped position that is very hard to defend.
