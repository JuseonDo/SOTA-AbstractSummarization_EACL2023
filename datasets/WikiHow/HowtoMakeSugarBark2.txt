 The firm base is important for keeping the sheet flat and easily handled. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF., Spread across evenly to ensure it is not lumpy or higher in one part than another., Allow to cook for approximately 8 to 10 minutes but watch it constantly as it will melt very quickly. It should turn a golden color when ready., If needed, tilt the tray to disperse the mixture across the sheet evenly., Once hardened, break into shards and use as needed.
