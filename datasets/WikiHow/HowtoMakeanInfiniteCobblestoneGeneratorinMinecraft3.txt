@summary
dig a hole, two blocks down and two blocks wide.

@summary
create containers for the lava and water, but don't place them just yet.

@summary
next, we'll set up a redstone contraption to detect when a block of cobblestone is formed.

@summary
now, to get the piston to push.

@summary
now place the water first, then the lava.

@summary
add a repeater to the block on the lava container that's right next to the first redstone wire we put down.

@summary
now, to stop keep it from doing this, add a detector that tells when the piston that is pushing sideways can't push any more blocks.

@summary
finally, adding an on/off switch.

@summary
mine to your heart's content.

Place a sticky piston with a glass on top of it in the hole.



The lava goes on the side closer to the piston and glass, and the water goes on the other side. the hole allows the water to flow horizontally at the flowing lava, creating cobblestone.



Add a redstone torch and a repeater to one side and throw some redstone dust on the ground on the other. Don't actually place the cobblestone, it was just for demonstration purposes.



Where the redstone wire is, dig down one block towards the water, then down away from the pistons, and then to the side one towards the lava.



The generator will work, but just push the blocks up. Then, add another piston to push them sideways to make them easier to mine, or even to add another row of pistons to make a self-repairing wall!

The repeater has to be on the first tick setting. Then, add the two blocks as seen in the picture and wire them up and throw the piston on there.



From the block that has the redstone torch on it, place 9 redstone on the ground going away from the lava. then place a block and put redstone on it. Put another redstone torch on the ground next to that block underneath where the cobblestone is pushed. This will turn off our first redstone torch and stop the generator. Also, if you do this you don't have to reset it. When neither of the pistons can push the new cobblestone, it is left there and the circuit stays on until you break the block next to the lava. With this you can just mine the cobblestone and it keeps going.



Go to the block that our first redstone torch is on, and put a switch on the back of it. When the switch is off, the generator will run, and when you turn the switch on, the generator will stop.
