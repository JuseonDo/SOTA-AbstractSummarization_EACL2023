 Recovering comes second to mastering the backbend itself. Once you have that down, you'll be ready to work on coming up from it.
 There are different ways to recover from a backbend:


Rock yourself back and forth until you stand
Get your weight into your legs and push yourself up
Use your waist to thrust yourself up

, When you recover your legs should almost be in the same position as they were when you were in the backbend so you can get back into the backbend easily.
