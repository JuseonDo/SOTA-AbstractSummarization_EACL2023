look at these similar triangles, and therefore the proportion {dg}/{dh}={de}/{df}.

@summary
to multiply x times y, make horizontal line dh of length 1, extend df of length x from dh and raise dg of length y at an angle above horizontal df.

@summary
to divide y by x, make dh of length 1, df of length x and de of length y.

@summary
suppose one stem or leaf underlying another, in its shadow.

@summary
suppose crossing roots (which they do) and suppose some sensitivity to one another -- could this be a way plants perform math and send vital nutrients on a timely basis up the plants?,

@summary
suppose neurons branching at various angles in the brain (which they do) -- could this be a way of computation of p/n = a.e.n.descartes also used the next proposition, vi.13, to take square roots geometrically.

@summary
if it can be done geometrically, then can mother nature perform it within reasonable tolerances?,

You can use it to perform multiplication and division. Open a new workbook in Excel and copy the drawing.;
,  Draw HG and construct a line through F parallel to HG.  Let it intersect DG at E. Then DE will have length xy.,  Draw EF and construct a line through H parallel to EF.  Let it intersect DE at G. Then DG will have length y/x., Would this possibly be a way of keeping time and "knowing when to move aside" to attain better light, directly, for the lower leaf or stem?, After all, the roots are in darkness, how do they know what time it is or calculate the proportion of a given chemical admixture to send?, (Almost Any Number)? That is, almost any number may be expressed as a quotient of two other numbers, e.g. 36/2 = 18 and 625/256 = 2.44140625, or 5^4 / 4^4 or 5/4^(1/(5/4 - 1)). See the articles Work with Continued Fractions in Microsoft Excel and Solve aB=a^B in Neutral Operations Using Algebra where it discusses E = mc^n as n approaches 2. Is it possible to "see yesterday" in the memory by seeing slower than stopped Time at light speed squared? Is the "Past" on the opposite side of all electrons facing me, and the "Future" spinning around from that opposed position to greet me too? That would make the immediate Past very much like the immediate Future, resulting in a fairly stable Present. And geometrically, all the rays from all the particles coming through in vibrations would be fairly constantly multiplied and divided as well, so long as one is fairly still, or in a relatively stable environment. Call this "The Supposition About Neurons and Neutrons" if you like.,, That is, can She get reasonable estimates of the square root or of any root of a number? One surmises "any root" from supposing an iterative process (that did not occur to Euclid, Descartes or Newton-Raphson apparently).,,
