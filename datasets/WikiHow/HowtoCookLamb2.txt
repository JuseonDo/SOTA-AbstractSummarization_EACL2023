 Add in the garlic cloves and rosemary, and then let the meat marinate for 2-3 hours.
 Heat the olive oil in a large, thick-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook until browned on each side (about 10 minutes total), adding salt as it cooks.


Cook the meat in a single layer, doing one batch at a time.
 Add the onions to the pan and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and golden brown. Mix in the garlic and cook for an additional minute.


Scrape the bottom of the pan occasionally with a wooden spoon.
 Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes.
 Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.


Meat should be very tender when finished.
