just go somewhere.

@summary
keep on visiting different nature areas that you know of locally.

@summary
after a few days kids, being kids, will get fed up of the beautiful fresh air and forest views so you can try something a little more suited to them, but remembering that you need fun too.

@summary
you can arrange a bbq with all your closest friends that have kids, and party with some karaoke maybe?,

@summary
as a special treat towards the end of summer you can arrange a day trip with your kids friends and their moms to a theme park.

 At the start of the holidays the kids won't really mind where they go. Maybe you can call up a few of the moms or dads that you know from school and invite everyone to a local park or inexpensive country park with play areas.;
, Maybe there are some forest trails in the areas. Take along a bike, scooter, skateboard, whatever pleases the kids really, or enjoy a nice walk along the trails, maybe listen to the forest awaken between 6am and 8am, or if the kids want a nice lie in then any time will do, after all, it's the cheap day out that counts!

, There is a perfect theory to this: Hit the beach with buckets, spades, nets and swimsuits for them and a book and towel for you, you can even bring a sun lounger and try to tan!

, The kids will be occupied with their friends, it's the perfect cocktail!

, There's plenty of good ones in Britain, like Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Pleasure Beach, Oakwood, Drayton Manor, Chessington World of Adventures and West Midlands Safari Park. Check the locations and find your closest one.
