 WD-40 is effective in removing grease from some surfaces, as are some lighter fluids.








Perform a spot test on an inconspicuous area of your clothing before attacking the stain with the WD-40 or lighter fluid. It's better to be safe than sorry.
,, Follow washing instructions on clothing label exactly.









When ready to dry, allow the clothing to air-dry. Drying in the extremely hot mechanical dryer may cause any lingering oil or grease to set into the clothing.
