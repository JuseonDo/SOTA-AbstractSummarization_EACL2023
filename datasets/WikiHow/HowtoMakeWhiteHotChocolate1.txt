 You can use any type of milk you'd like. If you want something richer, you could even try heavy cream of half-and-half., You can use solid white chocolate, chopped into pieces, or white chocolate chips. For best results, use good-quality white chocolate.
 Stir the mixture often to prevent scorching and do not let it come to a boil, or the chocolate will burn., This will help give the white hot chocolate a more complex flavor.
 If you'd like, you can make it extra special by garnishing it with some whipped cream or mini marshmallows.
