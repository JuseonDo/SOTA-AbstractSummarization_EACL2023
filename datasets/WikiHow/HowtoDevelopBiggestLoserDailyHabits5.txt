 Sometimes, we avoid going to the gym because we worry about how others will judge us. Don’t allow that fear to keep you from your exercise commitment.
 The carbs will give you extra energy to push through your workout.
 Having a partner will motivate you because someone else will be counting on you. You can also use exercise time to reconnect with someone you love.
 Cross training will keep your mind engaged and will help your body to work through weight-loss plateaus.
