 A list of the following things to put in it are:


Your club name, of course! Think of a fun name for your club. You probably want to think of something that is fun, creative, and personal. You could come up with a name using the first letter of each member's name, or you could each come up with a word and put the words together to form a name.
The friends you would like to have in your club - not ones that can join for sure, just ones that you wouldn't mind joining your club.
General information about your club, including things such as meeting times, plans, and policies.;
,, Also ask them if they will be able to attend meetings and parties.
 Don't make too many rules, so that your friends do not come to think of it like school!

, This can be a tree house, clubhouse or even your bedroom!

, This is the fun, crafty bit! Make/design/paint some posters for your bedroom door. Or if you want new members, and if you`re allowed, give out some fliers in school or advertise your club by stapling the posters to trees or bulletin boards around your community. You can also make a box that you can place the rules, agreements, photos so absolutely anything and you can alternate it between the leader and her assistant if you have an assistant leader.
 These can include a photo of themselves, full name and other simple things. ID cards are used to enter somewhere, for instance, of you want to enter a hideout, you would need an id to let the owner know it's you not someone in disguise. It is bad if you lose an id because you will not be able to enter the club. If you don't want to make ID cards you can make a piece of paper and when one member (or more) does something wrong put an x and kick him/her out of the club without any fighting.
, You don't want to tell them secrets and let them give them away to everyone.
