@summary
figure out what kind of guitar you have.

@summary
if you have an electric guitar, the industry standard is nickel wound.

@summary
if you have an acoustic guitar, determine if it requires steel strings or nylon strings.

@summary
nylon strings have a soft, mellow tone and are easy on the fingers.

@summary
pick ball-end nylon strings, frequently called "folk nylon," if you want to become a folk guitar player.

@summary
get monel strings if your fingers are strong enough to handle the metal strings.

@summary
select silk and steel for finger-style playing.

@summary
pick bronze strings for finger picking on a folk guitar.

@summary
buy a set of brass strings if you want your tone to be sharp and harsh.

@summary
get flat-polished strings if you desire ease of playing.

@summary
select flat-wound strings for any electric guitar.

@summary
make sure to get the correct type of strings for your guitar.

@summary
if you are playing using alternate tunings, you may wish to get a set that will retain the same tension in that particular tuning as a set tuned to standard.

 This will dictate whether you need electric guitar strings, acoustic steel strings, or nylon strings.;
, The most common gauge is 10-46. See Ernie Ball Regular Slinky or D'Addario EXL110. These are the most popular electric sets and provide a great starting point.
 Your guitar is built for one or the other. String gauge. If you want a thicker tone, choose a heavier (thicker) string gauge. If you want easier string to play, choose a lighter gauge.
 You will stay with them if you decide to play classical guitar.
 They are a little heavier than regular nylon and take vigorous strumming.
 They have a much sharper and louder tone than nylon. thickness varies according to the type of set purchased; medium-light gauge is recommended for beginners. Do not use them on classical or electric guitars!

, They are much easier on the fingers than the regular metal strings. Do not use them on electric guitars because they will not pick up electricity.
 They provide brilliance in sound. Select light gauge for finger-style playing, heavy gauge for strumming.
 They are usually more brittle than bronze.
 They are easier on your fingers than standard metal strings. These strings come for both acoustic and electric guitar.
 They are comfortable to the left hand and give a smooth tone when amplified. This string is preferred by many jazz guitarists. Flat-wound strings will provide a more mellow tone than a similar round-wound string, however will be harder to grip with your fingers during bends and fretting due to the smoother surface of the flat wrap wire., Acoustic steel strings( phosphor bronze, 80/20, etc...) have too high a string tension for a classical guitar and can damage it. Nylon strings won't vibrate the top of a steel string guitar enough to produce much sound. Electric guitar strings have a different composition than acoustic guitar strings to help the pickups function properly; specifically they have steel wrapping instead of bronze.
 For example a lot of metal bands use drop D/C/B/A tunings or D/C#/B standard tunings. For very low tunings choose a heavy set of guitar strings such as a 11. or 12. gauge set. Similarly if you play slide guitar in drop G tuning you would be better off choosing a set of strings which will have a high enough tension for you to play comfortably using a slide.
