 Use your computer or iPhone's web browser to open the web calendar that you want to add to your iPhone. You'll need to do this for any calendar service that is not listed in the Add Account menu on your iPhone.
 The process for this varies depending on the service you are using, but generally you'll find the Settings option in the upper-right corner.
 This may be listed in a section called "Calendar Address" or "Share Calendar." Clicking the iCal option will display the address for your calendar.


If you're having difficulty finding the iCal address for your calendar, check the Help and Support pages.
 You'll be entering his address into your iPhone's Settings menu. If you're already using your iPhone, select and copy the address. If you're using a different device, write the address down or leave it open so that you can type it on your iPhone.


iCal addresses end with the ".ics" extension.
 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens, and it may be in a folder labeled "Utilities."
