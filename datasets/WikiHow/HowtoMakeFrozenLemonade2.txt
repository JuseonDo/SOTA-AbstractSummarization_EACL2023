 You will be freezing the lemonade in this. Putting the pan in the freezer will make it extra cold by the time you are ready to add the lemonade. The result will be a somewhat smooth—not quite like a slushy, but not quite like a smoothie either.
 Save the remaining 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water for later. If you'd like, you can also add ¼ teaspoon of lemon zest for extra flavor and texture. Make sure that everything is evenly mixed together and the sugar is dissolved.
 During this time, the lemonade will start to freeze and turn to slush. Every 30 minutes, open the freezer, and stir the lemonade with a whisk. This will break up any large, icy chunks, and give you a smoother drink in the end., After the 90 minutes are up, take the pan out of the freezer and mix in the remaining cup of water. Give it a taste. If it is too strong, add a little bit more water. If it is too sour, add some more sugar. If it is too sweet, add a little bit more lemon juice., Pulse it on low for 20 seconds, then on high for 20 more seconds. Make sure that there are no large, icy chunks remaining., This makes either 4 small servings, or 2 large servings. For a fancier drink, garnish it with a sprinkle of lemon zest, a slice of lemon, or a mint leaf.
