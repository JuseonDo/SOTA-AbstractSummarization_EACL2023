, Add the sugar, garlic and shallot slices, fresh chive slices, salt and pepper. Add the tapioca and stir again until blended. This forms the filling or batter.
 Take two teaspoons of the filling. Place the filling on a piece of banana leaf, forming it into an elongated shape. Roll the banana leaf over the filling to encase it, then hold both ends of the banana leaf together with a toothpick or skewer. Repeat for the remaining filling and banana leaves.
 Occasionally turn the otak-otak parcels over, to help them all to cook evenly––and to dry the leaves.
