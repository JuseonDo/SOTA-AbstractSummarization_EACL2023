, Put a half cup or so in an old, clean sock (a good use for those lonely ones), tie off, and toss into the dryer with laundry to freshen. This can be used through several loads and enhanced with 5 to 7 drops of essential oils of lemon, lavender (especially good for bed linens), sweet orange, or pine (for household goods like washable rugs). When used up, the sock can be opened, emptied into the compost, and refilled several times.
 The ball can be used over and over.
 This is especially useful for natural fibers. Diluted vinegar is slightly acidic, which closes the cuticle of the fiber, making it smoother.
