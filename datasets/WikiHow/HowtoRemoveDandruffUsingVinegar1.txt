 Don't use a heavy shampoo and conditioner; Try to use a citrus-based or tea-tree oil-based product that doesn't strip your scalp of essential oils.;
, Pouring it slowly over your head, make sure to avoid your eyes. You may want to take a few breaks to work the mixture into your scalp with your hands.
 Give the wash some time to get into your scalp. There will be a strong smell of vinegar when you apply the wash but ignore that, as it will wash out.
 You can shampoo and condition again or you could simply rinse your hair with warm water. However, if you just rinse your hair with water, you may not get rid of all of the vinegar smell.
 It may take a few days for the dandruff to noticeably decrease but keep up the routine and it should. You may get sick of the smell of vinegar but the improved health of your scalp should be worth it.
