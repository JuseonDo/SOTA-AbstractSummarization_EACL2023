 Have everything cut and ready before putting the bow together.
 You will be using this piece to wrap nearly the entire clip with ribbon before adding your bow. Seal ribbon ends with a little heat (match or lighter).


Cut three pieces of ribbon, four inches long. Seal ribbon ends with a little heat (match or lighter).






Cut the felt and rubber shelf liner the same size-- 1 ¼ by 1/3 of an inch.
 Most of the ribbon will still be hanging off the clip.
, The top part of the clip and side should now be completely covered with ribbon.
 Be sure the knot is in the middle of the strip and can lay flat.


Create a circle shape with each remaining ribbon. Make a loop and add a small dab of glue to the ends. Hold in place until dry and flatten.






Pinch the circle right in the center and add a dot of hot glue to the inside center.






Make an “X” with the two circle pieces of ribbon and glue together in the middle of the ribbon “X.”






Lay the ribbon with the knot in the middle across the top of the ribbon “X.” Wrap the knot piece ends around the “X” and secure with hot glue.
 Press layers together and wait until fully cooled before using your fingers to press together. Scrap any glue that escapes from the sides of the pieces. Trim edges if necessary.
 This is the element that will hold the bow in place.
 Hold in place until completely dry/cool.
