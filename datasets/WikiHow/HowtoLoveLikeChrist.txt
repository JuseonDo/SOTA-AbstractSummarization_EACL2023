 Learn all about the good news of Jesus Christ gift of his life for all the people of the world to be saved:You are saved by grace , through faith, and that is not of yourselves; 'it is the gift of God': 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast... we are his work, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, (Ephesians 2:8-10).;
, Each one must repent: turn around, change your mind. You can't give people what you don't have. The Bible tells us we experience God's love when we receive the Holy Spirit ....the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit . (Romans5:5) , When you're sitting at your lunch table, and people are saying bad or less than nice things about other people -- then perhaps you could say something like, "Have you seen yourself? Do we have any place to judge?" Or simply change the subject.
 Be a peacemakers: Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. (1 Corinthians 13:4).
,,,, Telling them about Jesus' love is the best thing that you can do for them. Ask, "What have you done with Jesus".
