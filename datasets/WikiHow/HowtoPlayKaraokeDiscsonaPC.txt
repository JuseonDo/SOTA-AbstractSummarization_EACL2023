 Because you will be purchasing and using karaoke software and karaoke CD + G ("CD with graphics") discs, you will need a computer that has a Windows XP or Vista operating system, a processor of at least 800 MHz, at least 256 MB Ram and a 32-bit display.;
, If you don't have this on your computer, you could add one to your computer tower relatively inexpensively if you have the room for an additional drive.
 This is what the karaoke software will play through. This also enables you to have sound when you play the songs.
 If you already have decent speakers, this will probably be good enough for you. However, if you plan to use your PC to play karaoke in a large room or with a good amount of people, you may want to upgrade your speakers. The microphone you choose should sound loud enough for people to be able to hear you. In general, if you buy a decent microphone--one that isn't just made for play or for children--it should work for your needs

, If you don't need the words, you can just put in any karaoke CD and play it through Windows Media Player. One CD + G karaoke karaoke software available on the Internet is Siglos.,, Put in a karaoke CD, and you are ready to go! You can follow the simple instructions on the karaoke software and your computer to start playing the CD and start singing along with the words and music!
