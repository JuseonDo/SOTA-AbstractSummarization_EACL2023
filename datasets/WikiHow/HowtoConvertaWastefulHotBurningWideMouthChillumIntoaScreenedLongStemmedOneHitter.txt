select a socket-wrench piece fat enough to exactly match the inner diameter of the chillum bowl if cylindrical, otherwise drill a cylindrical opening matching the exterior diameter of the fat part of the socket wrench piece you have selected.

preshape the screen: with a 3/16"-diam.

position a metal-ring screen-support (or failing that, a hand-made ring of tinfoil) in quarter-inch hole (crater) of socket wrench piece, leaving 3/16" (5-mm.),

@summary
tap socket wrench piece carefully down into the mouth of the chillum so that the fat part fits tightly, about flush with the top of the chillum, and the narrow part, containing the screened crater, juts out about a centimeter (7/16 inch).

two methods of adding a long drawtube are shown in the diagram: a.

semi-vaporizer technique: the object is to insert 25-mg. (1/40 gram) of pre-sifted herb or shredded tobacco product, etc. into the crater-- rather than light up a whole 700-mg conventional cigarette, which instead breaks down into 28 separate pinch-servings, usable any time and place.

@summary
don't be in too great a hurry to get it started burning; desired ingredient (the nicotine, cannabinol, thymol or whatever) will vaporize out at temperatures just under 400 f.; once any part of the herb is dry enough to start burning, its function is to heat neighboring particles of the herb from which the ingredient is still vaporizing.

as few smokers appear to be aware, herbal ashes, even those of tobacco, are non-toxic to eat and contain a minor amount of nourishing minerals which are readily digestible.

, flat-ended stick or metal tube, drive a 7/16" square of Mesh #40 screen carefully down into the 1/4-inch square crater as far as it goes (about 3/16" or 5-mm. deep). Then with a flat-ended narrower stick or nail, push it out from the other end of the piece. With shears, trim away four sharp tufts of wire so that the side-legs or walls of the screen stick up uniformly 1/8" (3-mm.) (or to about 1/16" from top opening of the crater when in place). This cup-shaped screen is ready to install permanently, again with the 3/16" flat-ended stick you used before. For more details on screen-manufacturing see article, "How to Make 1/4-inch Screens for a Single-Toke Utensil"., distance to top. (An equivalent to this ring piece can also be made by cutting, and bending around, a small segment of Mesh #40 screen as mentioned below.) Then install screen (see above) so it will rest on this support ring and not sink further into the crater., (Tape or rubber-glue can be used to narrow the crater diameter slightly for tighter fit.), If the channel of the chillum at that end is wide enough (1/4" i.d.) you can cram into it tightly up to a half-inch of 1/4" o.d. flexible drawtube (plastic p.v.c. is considered safe at these exposure temperatures; use about 20 inches). b. If the channel is narrower, cram in a short length of metal tube, leaving a length of about 1/2" sticking out, over which the flexible drawtube fits tightly., If using a flame lighter, hold the flame far enough BELOW the opening to only heat the herb at first, drawing air steadily through the long tube, and when it starts burning, continue slow at low temperature to obtain most vapor value and least carbon monoxide. Properly sized "heat wands" are being developed which will make this vape lighting easier than with a flame lighter.,, Suck them out routinely as a prelude to cleaning the screen in readiness for next use. If you then grind them between tongue tip and palate you will find the taste interesting. (Just another example of knowledge that the hot-burning-overdose cigarette companies have used schlock advertising to keep everyone from learning.)
