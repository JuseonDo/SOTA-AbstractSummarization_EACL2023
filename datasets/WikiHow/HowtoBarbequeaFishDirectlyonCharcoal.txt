@summary
choose what to cook.

@summary
without scaling, skinning or gutting the fish, put it directly on the charcoal.

@summary
do not overcook, fish cook fast and even faster directly on charcoal.

@summary
peel the meat off of the centre bones and separate it from the charred exterior.

@summary
enjoy the fish with whatever seasoning or condiment packages available or use partially dried salt from a salt water pool.

@article
 Use branches from trees that are used for firewood. Do not use lumber because they might be chemically treated.;
,, Save your prized catch for home cooking and pick a fish that is average to good in taste because there will be some wastage. Do not pick a fish with thin skin and small scales like a mackerel. An average tasting fish will taste good when cooked on charcoal and outdoors.
 The scale or thick skin will protect the meat from burning. After a while, the aroma of wood burning and fish cooking will be quite appealing.
 After turning the fish over, do not cook it too long. Like cooking in a pan, the first side takes longer to cook. Poke at the fish with a fork to test if it its cooked, if the fork does not go in - let it cook longer.
 Discard the charred exterior.
