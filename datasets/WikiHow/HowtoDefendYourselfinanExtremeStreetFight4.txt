 Use these advanced tactics as a last resort.
 It will hurt the attacker a lot and disable them long enough for you to get away.


If you're training in martial arts, then use the techniques you've been taught, as this is a commonplace martial arts move (Judo, Jiu Jitsu, wrestling, etc)., Try to move around the attacker initially. Try to go behind the attacker. When you get a chance, wrap your left or right arm around the mid-point (about near the nose) of the head.









Hold on for a while, and then release them. Be mindful that they could still attack you once you break the headlock.
 If someone tries to do this to you, jump slightly backwards while still having them in a headlock. Knowing how to do this successfully though takes some practice.
