 You will need buttons, trap doors, some colored wool, etc.;
, But, gather four cobblestone. After that, head back to your furnace and place the cobblestone in and decide what are you going to use to start the fire, wood, or coal (coal is the best choice). Next, wait for the cobblestone to finish cooking. You should see stone. After obtaining the stone, head to the crafting table, and put the one stone in the bottom right corner and the other Stone on top. A button should appear. Take the button. (You need at least three buttons)

, Then craft the wood into wooden planks and start by placing three wooden planks on all of the slots of the bottom row of the crafting table. Next, place another set of three above the placed wooden planks. You should be able to see trapdoors. Obtain them. (You need at least three trapdoors)

, The sheep can be white, black, or gray. You should take plenty of the white, black, and gray, wool you see. If you can't find black, or gray sheep, first, find squid. Squid live in water. Kill the squid and see if the squid dropped some ink. If the squid did release ink, head back to the crafting table, put one white wool in the middle slot of the bottom row, then place the ink on top of it. If you can't get gray wool, put the black wool in the same bottom spot, and put bonemeal on top.
 Then, place a button so the button looks like the handle of the stove.
 Then put a button on the top white wool so it looks like the handle of the fridge.


Or, make a fridge by putting an iron block, and a dispenser loaded with food, then put a button on the iron block and an iron door.
 (Sandstone recommended) Place the counters anywhere you want.
,, It looks more kitchen-like.
 Furnaces can cook pork, fish, etc.
 Make the table by putting one fence post on the ground and then a pressure plate on top. Make the chairs by putting one step down and putting two signs beside the steps.
