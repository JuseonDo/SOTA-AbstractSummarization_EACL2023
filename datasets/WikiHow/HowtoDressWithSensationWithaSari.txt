 Buy a ready made sari, with the pleats at the skirt done. Also, the, "pallu", or the part which goes above the breast should be silken and decorated so that extra pleats won't be needed.;
, When the ends meet, the skirt waist should have two strings. Tie them together to secure the skirt on. The pleated part should be in the front center.
 The, "pallu", a decorated part should appear above your breasts. Since this is a ready made sari it should be decorated enough and not in need of pleats.
 Alternately, wear black boots or other fancy footwear. Try to have it gleaming, especially if your sari is gleaming.
 Fasten them on like a necklace is fastened on. You can buy these at Indian stores.
 Try to use shining ones which match with your outfit. Generally, anywhere from five to ten bracelets per wrist is good.
 This necklace should be large and gleaming. Fasten it so it does not dangle much.

 Straighten it and brush it back. Wear a bindi, also found in an Indian store, on your forehead. Make it match with your outfit.
 Also wear some perfume to add femininity.

 If it gets onto the skin, wipe it off with lotion. This will make your eyes look prettier.
