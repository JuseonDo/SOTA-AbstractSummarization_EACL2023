 Making vegan eggnog with cashews requires one cup of raw, unsalted cashews, pitted medjool dates, nutmeg, salt, and a can of coconut milk.You’ll also need two cups of water and can, if you choose, add one tablespoon of maple syrup.


Be sure to get unsalted cashews or your eggnog will have a salty taste.
This recipe will make about two cups of nog.;
, Put your cashews in a bowl or cup and cover them with water. Many people find it convenient to soak the cashews in the fridge overnight. This helps soften them so they are ready for processing later.


Some recipes recommend rinsing the cashews after soaking and discarding the water, but it is not necessary to rinse them.
 You might notice the water start to darken or see the dates plump up. This is normal and indicates the dates are absorbing water and releasing their sugar.
 Blend until the mixture is uniformly smooth.


Do not use the same water you used to soak the cashews.
 Blend everything for several minutes until the mixture is smooth.
 Pour yourself or your friends a glass when it is ready. If you wish, add ice to the cup. Top with cinnamon or nutmeg.


Store eggnog you don’t drink in the fridge, covered, and drink within three days.
