 Cut the portobello mushrooms from one 8 oz. package into pieces that are 1/2 to 2 inches (1.2 to 5 cm) long., You don't have to chop it into perfectly-sized pieces -- just cut it enough so the chard can fit into the pan, with leaves that are no more than 5 inches (12 cm) long., olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat., crushed red pepper and 1 clove crushed garlic into the oil., Stir the mushrooms until they have softened and have begun to release their liquid. This should take 3-5 minutes., Cook for 5 more minutes, until the leek has softened., Cover the mixture and simmer it until the chard leaves wilted. This should take about 10 minutes., Keep cooking the chard until it's tender and most of the liquid has evaporated. Make sure not to burn the chard if the liquid has evaporated too early. This should take about five minutes., Let the chard stand until the cheese is melted., Serve the chard and portobellos as a side dish, or even as a main course. You can top some quinoa or whole wheat pasta with the chard for a delicious meal.
