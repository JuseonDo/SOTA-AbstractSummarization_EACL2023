 This method is best used for shoes that are a little tight in the toe area.;
, Tuck them down towards the toe area. If you are worried about the bags leaking, place them into another bag before putting them inside the shoe.
 If you are disgusted by the idea of sticking your shoes into the freezer, stick your shoes into plastic bags first.
 As the water freezes, it will expand and stretch your shoes.
 If the bags are difficult to take out, let the ice melt a little. You can also try breaking the ice with a hammer.
 This will help them retain their shape, and ensure that they don't shrink while they warm back up.
