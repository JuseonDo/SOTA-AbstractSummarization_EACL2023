 Most will provide drop-off locations where you can donate glasses. They may provide links to state, regional or national centers.
 Donating eyeglasses can be easier if you can find a drop-off box close to your work or home.


Examples of places with drop-off boxes include local non-profit organizations, volunteer organizations, libraries, churches, community centers, schools, doctors' offices and even coffee shops.
 Simply place non prescription or outdated prescription eyeglasses into the designated box.
