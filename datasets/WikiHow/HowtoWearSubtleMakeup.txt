 Apply cleanser to a wet face. Use clean hands or a washcloth and rub the cleanser gently in repetitive circles. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry with a fresh washcloth. Don't rub--this could irritate your skin!;
, An overload of liquid makeup can be very noticeable and you could get caught! Apply thinly and evenly. Avoid putting a lot of makeup in the center of the face.
, Use your forefinger (if your hands are washed) to apply. If you have darker skin, use a bronze color.
 This makes your skin look more even and covers up the blemishes even more.
 DO NOT layer this on---MINERAL MAKEUP CAN LOOK VERY NOTICEABLE IN THE LIGHT.
 Find a color of blush that suits your skin tone and apply to the apples of your cheeks. Smile while doing so. Take a kabuki brush with no makeup on it and blend in the makeup. This spreads the blush and makes you look more natural.
 If you have pinkish/salmon colored skin, use beige or a light brown color with a bit of sparkle!

, Open your eyes slightly while doing this. Make sure the line isn't too thick or people will notice! Make sure the line is thin. Using a smudge brush, "smudge" the eyeliner to make it more natural and blended in.
 Make sure the line is thin! To make the eyeliner not as dark, apply a silver green or silver over the brown. This color mixture is flattering to most any color eye without being to harsh.
 Don't use too much or your parents or friends will certainly notice. However, don't apply too little. Be bold.
 You can use black if you prefer, but to avoid be noticed, softer colors are better.
 Take a neutral lipstick and apply to upper and lower lips. Avoid smacking your lips together, as this can mess up the lipstick before it dries.
