 You can use any mix of deliciousness that may appeal to you. Red potatoes, carrots, rutabaga, onions, and beef hamburger make a great mix.


Other options may be; the breakfast pasty with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and hamburger; the pizza pasty with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, and pizza sauce.;
, The rutabaga will be difficult to cut if you don't use a heavy knife with a sturdy blade. You may peel the potatoes if you prefer, but it doesn't hurt to leave them unpeeled.
 You may prefer your pasties unseasoned, but salt, pepper, hot sauce, garlic, or almost any other seasoning is an option.


Quantities kind of matter at this point, but everything depends on what you have available, and what you like. Generally, this recipe will make more than enough filling for 6 medium pasties.
 Mix it with your hands, kind of like playing with play-dough. Only it is meat. And vegetables.
, You will need 3 cups of white flour, 1 cup of lard or shortening, and water. Mix the lard with the flour until it reaches a crumbly consistency. Add water until the dough is workable, but doesn't stick to your hands. Add flour as necessary to achieve this state.
 It's time to put these puppies together!

, You'll want to have a relatively circular formation about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and about the thickness of a thin pizza crust, or the fabric of a standard t-shirt.
 Place it in the middle of your dough, more or less in the shape of a ball.
 Squeeze/crimp them together at the top and along the sides.


If you have excess dough, be sure to cut it off and reuse it. If you didn't use enough to enclose your filling...well that's ok, just use a little more next time.
 This will prevent even distribution of your precious pasties on the inner surface of your oven.
,, Keep your eye on them, and when they are golden brown, select one to slice in half to check the doneness of the meat.
