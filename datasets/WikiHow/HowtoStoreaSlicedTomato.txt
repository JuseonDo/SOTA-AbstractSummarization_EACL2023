 Do not cover the entire tomato. Use a just enough to cover from a sheet of kitchen foil, or some plastic food wrap.;
,, Although you may be tempted to place it in the refrigerator, doing so will destroy the flavour enzymes and cause the tomato to break down and become mealy in texture.
 If your kitchen is exceptionally hot, it would be best to consume the tomato at the next meal. You may need to cover the tomato to keep flies or other insects off as well.
