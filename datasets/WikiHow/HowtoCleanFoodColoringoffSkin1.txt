 Be sure to rub the area with soap to get a good lather. Sometimes, this is all you need in order to get the dye off.Keep your skin damp, and don't dry it off yet.






;
, If you can, try getting some toothpaste that has baking soda in it. It will be even more effective., Put a on a thin layer of toothpaste on the stain. Gently rub it in using circular motions. If you got the food coloring on your hands, rub your hands together like you would with soap. The toothpaste will help scrub the stain away.









You can also apply the toothpaste with a washcloth instead.
 After a while, the dye should start to fade.
 If your skin feels a sticky from the toothpaste, wash it using some soap and water. The food coloring should be barely visible by now.
 If the stain is still there, try washing it again with some more toothpaste and water. Deep-set stains may require a few treatments. If your skin starts to feel raw at any point, take a break and try again after a few hours.
