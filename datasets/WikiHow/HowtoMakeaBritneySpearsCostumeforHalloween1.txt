, Use superglue to embellish it with beads and rhinestones in the center of the bra as well as where the straps meet the cups.
 Sling several heavily embellished belts around your waist, using safety pins to clasp them unevenly around yourself. Alternatively, use fashion glue to adhere rhinestone designs all over your swimsuit bottom, as Brittany does.
 Use a safety pin to attach one end to the sides of your swimsuit bottom, and tie a knot there. Let the other end flow to the ground.


Alternatively, if you can attach rings to your swimsuit bottom, you can simply tie the scarves on. This closely matches what Britney does on Glee.
Use at least four scarves for the best effect.
These scarves should be by your hips or slightly behind you, not in front of your body.
, Line your eyes with black or brown eyeliner and then apply a matte blue color. Blend a shimmer green eyeshadow in.


You may vary the colors based on what you know looks good with your skin tone and eye color, but make sure that the colors match your costume.
 Embellish with rhinestones you can stick onto your body.


Drawing a design around your belly button is important. If you are comfortable doing so, buy a clip-on belly button ring and wear that as well.
 This is the distinctive part of Britney's costume.
