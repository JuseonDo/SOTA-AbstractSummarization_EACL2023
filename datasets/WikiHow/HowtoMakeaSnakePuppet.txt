@summary
lay out the materials.

@summary
drill a hole into the tip of each egg half, excluding one "long" egg half.

@summary
drill two holes as shown in the "long" half set aside for the head.

@summary
cut a string at least 5 feet (1.5m) long (this is the spinal string).snake puppet step 5.jpg|center]],

@summary
string together the rest of the snake body:

@summary
use one bead before each "short" half, and two beads before each "long" half.

@summary
complete the body after you have reached a desirable length:

@summary
string a few extra beads after the last egg half.

@summary
make the control rods.

@summary
lay out the snake body and both rods, as shown.

@summary
cut a string at least 3' (.9m) long.

@summary
connect the body to the control rod a by threading it through the hole.

@summary
connect the next 3 body strings:

@summary
line up the next control hole with the body, and tie a string as before to the body itself.

@summary
spread hot glue onto the back of one googly eye using a hot glue gun.

@summary
cut a string at least 6' (1.8m) long.

@summary
tie each end of the string to the outermost hole of control rod b, so that the head hangs in the center of a triangle.

@summary
dab hot glue over the holes in the head to secure the head string.

@summary
finished!

, This is set aside for the head of the snake.
 The holes should make an axis horizontally. Paint the eggs halves with spray or acrylic paint at this time, if desired.
 Tie a loop around a bead with the spinal string. Thread the string through the bead and tie it off.
,







Alternate "short" and "long" egg halves







Here is the final body:







,







Tie off the last bead by tying the string to itself. Loop the string through the last bead once more for strength, and tie if off again. Trim the remaining string.



To create rod A, drill a hole 1" (2.5cm) from each end of the dowel.







To create rod B, drill a hole 1" (2.5cm) from each end as well as a third hole 1/2" (1.2cm) from one end.







Sand the splinters off with sandpaper, if necessary.
 Make sure to position control rod B near the head, with the end with 2 holes nearest the head.
 Tie one end to the spinal string where the first hole in rod A lines up.
 Tie the first body string off.








Before tying off the 2nd string, hold up the control and puppet to make sure that the 2nd string is the same length as the first. Tie the 2nd string to the control.







Repeat the process for the next two body strings and control rod B. Hold up the puppet every time to test the string length.







Be sure to connect the front-most body string to the inner hole of the front of rod B.
 Stick the eye onto the front of the head. Repeat for the other eye.



Make sure the eyes are between the holes drilled in step 3.
 Thread it through the head holes drilled in step 3. Snap the front of the head to the back to make a whole egg.
 Adjust the length so that the head hangs as desired.
 Make sure that the head is level while holding the control rod.
