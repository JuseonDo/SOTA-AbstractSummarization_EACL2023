 This is particularly true if you haven't had the ring fitted properly, and it either keeps sliding off your finger or it cuts off your circulation; if that is the case, find a jeweler or a jewelry-loving friend who can recommend someone to fix it as soon as possible.

 Another tactic to employ if you're self-conscious of your hands is to get a tan--just be careful not to turn yourself orange and you should be perfectly fine.
