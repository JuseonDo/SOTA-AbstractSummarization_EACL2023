, Form it into a ponytail right on the crown of your head., Once you have tied your ponytail with a hair elastic (or 2 or 3), use your comb and a small amount of gel to straighten and fix any messy or bumpy parts., Then use it to cover your ponytail so it will be easier to form it into a bun shape.,

If your hair is thick, split your ponytail in two, then wrap the first strand in a bun shape. Wrap the second strand in the opposite way you did the first strand.
If you have thin hair, you don't have to split it into two sections. Simply make the bun.
 Tie in place with hair elastics or pin in place with bobby pins. Or you can do both!, This will ensure your bun won't fall out.,
