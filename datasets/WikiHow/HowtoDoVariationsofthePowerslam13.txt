 This name is an incorrect Americanization of the name for ura-nage, which, translated directly from the Japanese, means, literally, "throw to behind". It has erroneously been translated as "reverse side throw", which is incorrect; the word "ura" means "behind".

This move is very closely associated with The Rock who popularized the move as the Rock Bottom.
Booker T is also a practitioner of this move. His variation is called the Book End.



Matt Hardy uses a variation in which he locks both hands together behind the opponent's back, lifts them up, and swings forward into a sitout position while slamming the opponent down, calling it the Side Effect.
Takeshi Rikio has innovated a high lifting variation where he wraps one of his arms around one thigh and one arm around the waist of the opponent, lifts him up, and them slams him down.
