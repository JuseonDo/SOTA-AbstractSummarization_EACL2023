 You can do this with a fork in a small bowl or in a blender. Avocados have lots of vitamins and essential fatty acids, which will help strengthen and restore your hair., Honey is a humectant, so it will help draw and seal moisture into your hair; hydration is a big part of caring for damaged or brittle hair. The olive oil will help further penetrate and moisturize your hair.
 If the ingredients are not mixing together evenly, pause the blender, and scrape any lumps or clumps down towards the bottom of the blender.
 Dampen your hair first, then spread the deep conditioner throughout it. If you have long or thick hair, you might want to divide your hair into smaller sections first. If you have any leftover conditioner, throw it out; it won't last long.
 To get even more out of this mask, wrap a warm towel around your head. The plastic shower cap will help trap heat and moisture, and make this mask more effective.
 If you need to, apply some regular conditioner afterwards. Once your hair is clean, style is as your normally would.
