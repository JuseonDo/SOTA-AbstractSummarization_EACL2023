,,, You will be brought to a menu.
 The Project Directory is where your game and its assets will be saved. Give your project an appropriate name then click Create.


You'll be directed to branching paths on the left side.
 Right-click it. Click Create Sprite. GameMaker will direct you to a box for this individual asset known as the sprite. Sprites serve as the objects on the level.


Name the sprite something appropriate, such as Player. Click on Edit Sprite.
 These represent the length of the pixels of both the vertical and horizontal size of the Sprite. For tutorial purposes, the recommended size is the default 32 x 32 Pixels. Click Okay.
 The new palette that opened up allows zooming in for more precise detail. Click the box to open the editing tools. For tutorial purposes, the sprite will be represented as a filled in box. Create a sprite of whatever you wish. Click on the green arrow.


You have successfully created your sprite. Now repeat the process. Create a sprite and fill it up with a color. This sprite will act as the wall of your level.
 Go to the folder labeled Objects. Right-click Objects. Click Create Object.
 Note the Events Window and the Actions Window. This entails what the Object will do. For now, name the Object something appropriate.
 Any existing sprites will show up in the menu. Left click it. Find the sprite you created in the previous part. Select it. This attaches the Sprite to the Object. Press Okay.
, Find the folder called Rooms. RIght-click and press Create Room.
 Focus first on naming it something appropriate.
 For height, set it 360. These numbers are for the basic 16:9 ratios. They are not the resolutions you have to pick but they are universal across most modern widescreen monitors.
, Click on the wall object.
 As the wall object serves as what will stop the player from moving, you will establish a wall around the edges of the grid. Feel free to vary with design.
, You have created a game level. Proceed onto basic coding.
