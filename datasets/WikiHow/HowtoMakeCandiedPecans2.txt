 Toasting will make the nuts more fragrant and flavorful.Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Toast until they release a strong nutty aroma, then remove from the pan and set aside., Stir to combine. Do not worry if all the sugar and salt don’t dissolve.You can also add additional ingredients to spice up the recipe:


Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon for delicious cinnamon-sugar nuts.Add ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper for spicier nuts.For really flavor-packed nuts, add ¼ teaspoon cumin, ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon dried ground orange peel., Cook until the sugar dissolves and is bubbling – approximately 5 minutes., This should take only 15 seconds or so., Either separate them immediately with forks, or wait until they have cooled and break the nuts apart.
