 Building the foundation of the zigalo is perhaps the most important step in the entire building process. A strong foundation is helpful; a correctly-built foundation is vital.;
,,, Each should have a diameter of approximately one centimeter.
 Each should be between four and six feet in height and no more than one centimeter in diameter.
 If the pole has extra space to move around in the hole, use cement filler to surround the pole, fill in the hole, and restrict all movement of the pole.
 These five sheets will make up the five faces of the tent (not the bottom). These fiberglass sheets should measure the width of the plywood side and the height of the metal poles.
 This step is difficult and may require the assistance of a professional. Next, create a small doorway in one of the sides of the zigalo. Again, your best bet is to leave this to a professional.
 This is very important, as it will allow ample air to enter and exit the zigalo.
 The overall structure of the zigalo is, at this point, complete. Design the zigalo in any way you choose.
