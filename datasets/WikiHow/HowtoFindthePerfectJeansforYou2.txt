Wide leg or baggy jeans will look too loose.
High rises may make your backside look flat., Men with a slim waist, muscular legs, and a muscular backside look best in any of these styles with a low rise.

Baggy jeans will hide your muscular legs.
Relaxed fit jeans will make your lower half look bigger than your upper half., Stocky men who frequent the gym fit relaxed fit with large deep pockets best. This jean style is just the right amount of snug, and does a good job of accentuating muscular legs without looking too tight.

Bootcut jeans will make you look wider than you actually are.
Skinny jeans will be extremely tight on your legs and backside., If you’re a little wider around your hips or your midsection, loose or relaxed fit jeans will create balance by adding some volume to the lower half of your body.

Avoid skinny jeans and low rise jeans.
