 Choose a plastic bottle with a flat bottom, not a rounded one.;
, This will help balance the bottle right as you spin it, and it will help it land straight.
 This will help the bottle land on the surface and not fall over.
 Grasp it gently at the neck or cap area of the bottle.
 Launch it into a small spin by applying a downward force to make it do a big turn onto the surface.
 The only way to master in this game is to practice it.
