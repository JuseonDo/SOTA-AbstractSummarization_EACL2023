Set the microwave to medium power.
As microwaves vary, check at 60 seconds and stir the chocolate.
As the chocolate melts reduce the time of intervals, for example start checking every 30 seconds.
Do not overheat the chocolate. It will continue to melt when you remove the container and continue to stir. Note for future reference the amount of time required for the amount of chocolate you used and the microwave settings you set.
