 You'll need a desk. Look for something that's strong enough to hold a few computers. Cable management systems are a plus! Also, you'll need a comfortable chair.;
, Get a good desktop computer- not a store brand machine, and possibly a laptop or a netbook, too.
 Speakers, wireless mice, keyboards, external hard drives, or anything that you see important.
 Put the monitor(s) at eye level and make sure that the keyboard is within easy reach.
 Make sure that everything runs smoothly and that all electronics are working properly.
 If something doesn't work as planned while testing, fix it!
