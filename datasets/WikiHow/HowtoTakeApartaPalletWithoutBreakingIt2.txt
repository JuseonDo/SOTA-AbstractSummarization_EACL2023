 Always ask before you take them, unless they are near a garbage can.
 This is the place you will start.
 This method is far more labor intensive than the saw method.
, You will usually loop the pry bar underneath the 2 x 4s, where it meets the frame.
 Donâ€™t try to lift the board all the way up, just loosen the nail. Move a few inches away and repeat to loosen the nail further.


Doing too much too soon with your pry bar will split the wood. You must move slowly and rock the pry bar around the nail, rather than trying to lift it up forcefully.
 Hit the top of the crowbar with a hammer to help wedge it under tightly nailed sections of board.
 Once all three nailed sections of the slat are loosened, work the pry bar underneath as far as you can and pull up the slat.
 Dispose of the nails, rather than keeping them on the ground.
 The whole process can take 30 minutes or more and requires physical strength.
