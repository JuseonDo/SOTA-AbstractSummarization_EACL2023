 You will need:


Wool (any colour)
Ladders
Coal block
Block of your choice for the apron
Another block of your choice for the ring mat;
, Choose how big you want your ring to be and make your apron (outline of the ring) with your block of choice.


About 10-5 on each side is good. Keep it 1 block high.
 A good choice might be quartz, but it's up to you.


If you have room you can put in a letter like R for Raw

, If you used coal block for the apron or ring mat, change the post colour for a better look.



This makes the ropes for your ring

, Do this on every corner, inside and out. This gives access to the ring and the top rope

, You might like to add an entrance with fireworks or an announcers table with some commentators.
