as party favors you could give away clip on pets, (if you did the clothesline thing or hung them another way and you wouldn't mind giving them away but it's your choice and make sure no one fights over stuff.)

 For decorations if you have neopets stuffed animals you can scatter them around. For a creative idea if you have lots of clip on pets and petpets you can hang them on a clothesline or individually.You can also put up posters or pictures of Neopets. There are Colouring Pages and 'How To Draw' pages on Neopets -including Faerieland.;
, You can also ask guest to bring over their Neopets stuff to play with. If you have interactive plushies, they can talk to each other! You can also film a show or movie with some pets and pet pets. You can also play classic party games but turn the into Neopet themed games. Like pin the tail on kacheek, Musical Neopia and any other games you can think of.
 Things like cookies shaped like pets or petpets or pet or petpet shaped cakes, sandwiches, ice cream sandwiches, and whatever you can think of because it's your party, your decision!

, If you have a small amount of guests or don't mind spending the money you can give your guests ZAZZLE Neopets shirts on the spot or let them go on your computer and personalize them. ( With parental permission) and once again you can also give away classic favors, too.
