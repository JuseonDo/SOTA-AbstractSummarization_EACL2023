wipe up the red wine spill if it hasn't fully dried, using a wet paper towel or wet absorbent cloth.

@summary
if the wine has begun setting in to the wood, the first step is to try to clean the stained area with a strong bleach.

@summary
next, try oil soap.

@summary
if the oil soap doesn't work, try a soda paste.

@summary
as a last resort, you can try using rottenstone.

@summary
if the stain is still there, contact a wood care professional.

 Blot up the wine rather than rubbing it in.;
, Pour undiluted bleach on the area and let it soak for at least 45 minutes before wiping it up. Use latex gloves to wipe it up, as bleach can be caustic. (NOTE: The bleach may very well take off the existing surface coat, possibly requiring you to resurface the entire table. Test where you can't see it before applying bleach to the surface of a finished table.)

, Mix oil soap and hot water, according to package directions, then dip a soft cloth into the mixture, and scrub the wood. Hopefully, the stain disappears.
 Mix baking soda with enough mineral oil, lemon oil, or linseed oil to form a paste, and then lightly rub it over the stain with a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. Leave the paste on for 30 minutes, and remove it with a clean dry cloth.
 Make a paste from rottenstone, a very finely ground rock that woodworkers use as a polishing abrasive. You also can use pumice, although keep in mind that this is slightly more abrasive. Mix with mineral oil, lemon oil, or linseed oil, and lightly rub it onto the stain in the direction of the wood grain. Remove with a clean dry cloth.
