 You will be given 275 gold charms and experience in Summoning.
 You will need to invest a huge chunk of change to achieve 99 in this skill.


Levels 4-16 For these levels you should focus mainly on making Dreadfowl Pouches. You will need to make 270 pouches to get to the next level.






Levels 16-52 For these levels you should make Granite Crab Pouches the entire way. You will need to make 5,600 pouches to move on to the next step.






Levels 52-66 Now you will want to make 5,500 Spirit Terrorbird Pouches. These are very good experience and only take 11 Spirit Shards per Pouch.






Levels 66-74 Stranger plants. These use crimson charms, and take around 2,000 pouches to get there.
Levels 74-85 Granite lobsters. These again use crimson charms, taking around 6,500 pouches to create.
Levels 85-89 Lava titans. These take blue charms to create, and will take around 2,100 to create. If you wish to save your blue charms, you can create barker toads, although these will take a lot longer.
Levels 89-99 Geyser titans. These take blue charms, and will take about 10k blue charms. Alternatively, use swamp titans with crimson charms.
 You are now a proud owner of one of the rarest skillcapes in runescape, the Summoning Cape Congrats!
