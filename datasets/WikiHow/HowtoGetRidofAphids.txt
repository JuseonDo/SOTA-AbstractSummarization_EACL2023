 This will sometimes look black because a fungus or mold forms.;
,,, You may see these tiny insects.
,, Concentrate on younger plants, which aphids prefer. Do this every couple of days.



Use a solution of:

8 cups of warm water
1/2 cup of vegetable oil
6-8 drops of dish soap (Do not use too much soap, as it can burn the leaves.)
A pinch of cayenne pepper.


Shake well and use this weekly on infected plants.
 One example is 1/4 cup of chopped ginger with 1 cup of warm water. Let it soak for 2 hours, shake well and spray all over the plants.
 These will appear naturally during heavy aphid infestations and will help to control the aphid population, but will likely not eliminate the aphids.Alternatively you can purchase these natural controls online to supplement the naturally occurring aphids predators. Note that it is important to not use a broad spectrum insecticide on aphids for it will kill the beneficial insects in your garden (including pollinators).
 These include alyssum, nasturtiums, carrots, marigolds, dill, cilantro, mustard, and chives.
, Use care with this, as it can be toxic to you, children, and animals.
 Ants can kill insects that feed on aphids, so using an ant killer around your plants may help. Ants also herd (farm) aphids. Meaning that the ants will keep the aphids alive and protect them as an available food source.
