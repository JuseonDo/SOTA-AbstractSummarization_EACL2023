 The tools required are very simple – you probably already have everything you need at home. The items required are crayons/markers, a paper plate, a sharpened pencil, pushpins, a ruler and a straight plastic straw.


Start preparing the plate at around 11:30 a.m on a sunny, cloudless day., Use a crayon or marker for this. Take the sharpened pencil and push it through the center of the paper plate. Remove the pencil so that you’re left with a hole in the center.
 Draw it from the 12 to the hole you made in the center of the plate. This number represents 12 o’clock noon.
 Your straw, or gnomon, should point towards the closest celestial pole, which is parallel with the Earth's axis. That's the North Pole for those living in the Northern Hemisphere. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the South Pole., Stick the straw through the hole in the center of the plate.
 Do this so that it slants in the direction of the closest celestial pole.
 Rotate it so that the straw’s shadow is aligned with the line you drew. Since you are only measuring the hours of daylight, the plate will end up looking kind of like a clock, showing only 12 hours.
 Poke a few pushpins through the plate so that it will stay fixed in the same place on the ground.
 Write the number 1 at the very edge of the plate, where you see the shadow falling.
 Continue marking the shadow’s position on the edge of the plate. You will observe that the shadow is moving in a clockwise direction., Ask them why they think the shadow is moving. Explain what is happening as the shadow moves around the dial.
 At this point, the sundial will be complete.
 Have your child return to the plate on the next sunny day and tell you the time based on the shadow’s position. This simple device can be used to tell the time on any sunny day.
