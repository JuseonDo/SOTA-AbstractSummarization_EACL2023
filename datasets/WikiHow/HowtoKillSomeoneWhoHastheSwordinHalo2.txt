@summary
throw a grenade while backpedaling, the sword guys only move is to come straight at you so you can just shoot him while his shields are down, if he does lunge at you, throw a sticky or melee!
@article
 It's one of the only weapons that can beat the sword in close quarters.;
, When they start to move towards you really quickly, pull the trigger and kill them with the shotgun. Then take the sword because it has a higher kill range and it also lowers morale if they know you have it.
 You don't need to do noob combo, you just need the plasma pistol and a quick thumb.
 Then, when the sword-holder lunges, release the trigger and press down on the B button quickly. There's a certain amount of luck involved, but if you get the timing right, it will kill them, earn you a Beat Down medal, and you'll LOVE the surprised expression on their face.
, if his shields are down you might get him or at least take out both of you.
