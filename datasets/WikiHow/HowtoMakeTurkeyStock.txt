 Roasting the turkey will bring out a richer flavor in the stock; however, you can skip this step if you are short on time and are using a leftover carcass.;
, Arrange it on a large rimmed baking sheet. Alternatively, arrange your turkey wings on the baking sheet.
 Roast the turkey wings for 45 minutes. Turn the wings halfway through the time.
 Transfer the wings or the carcass to your large stock pot with tongs. Discard any fat from the baking sheet.
 Scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon. Pour the liquid into the stockpot.
 Arrange them on the baking sheet and roast for 15 to 25 minutes. If you want a more fragrant vegetable flavor, double or triple the amount of vegetables you use.You can also forego this step if you have limited time for prep.
 Transfer them to the stockpot.
,, Reduce the heat to low.
 Ensure the stock is reduced by at least one-third before you remove it from the stove.
 Allow it to cool slightly so its easier to handle.
 Discard the solid foods.
 Once skin forms on the top, use a spoon to skim off the layer of fat. Discard it.
 To remove additional fat, keep it in the refrigerator overnight and allow the fat to rise to the surface. Skim the layer of fat off the top before storing., Place the containers in the refrigerator or freezer. Refrigerated stock is good for three days, while frozen stock is good for three months.
