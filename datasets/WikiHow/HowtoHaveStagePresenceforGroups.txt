 Know everybody else's lyrics, so that you can fill in and define parts of the song to get or keep the crowd hyped. Rehearsal is important in order to show that your a professional or on the brink of becoming a pro, you’d got to know where the other person should be onstage.;
, Always, go center stage when your verse starts this brings the attention to you, especially if you have multiple people on stage.
 This shows the crowd you're into it, and pulls them into your world.
 Talk to them, tell them a short story about yourself that leads up to a song. Either, the story can be funny or serious, as long as it leads into a song that emphasizes the feelings of the story, your audience will be able to connect with you.
 Being able to perform in front of people should get you amp’d anyway. But most importantly have fun, show the crowd that your enjoying yourself, and they will enjoy right along with you.
