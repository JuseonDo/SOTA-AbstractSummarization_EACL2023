 Different airlines have different policies, so be sure to read up before you go.;
, You'll either be crowded by it under the seat or annoyed when you have to be opening the overhead compartment. Just pack a backpack or medium-sized bag especially to carry on with all the stuff you need on the flight.
 If you bring something battery run, bring extra batteries. If it requires charging, fully charge it before the trip. Some airlines will offer USB ports to charge devices (as well normal home plug-ins if possible), but you will have to see if your seat has it. The top essentials for a carry on bag are a tablet with a few movies on it, headphones, a few snacks, a charger, your phone, and gum to help your ears when you land.
 They don't have the stellar views of window seats, but you can get in and out a lot easier (especially when people on the plane start falling asleep). If you still really want a window seat, you'll have to be aware that its complicated getting past the sleeping passengers next to you, so you'll want to use the restroom right before you get on the plane.
, Make sure you drink lots of fluids, especially water

, Even in summertime, the planes are cold.
 This will also help you prevent your ears getting plugged when you're so high up in the air.But don't forget it on the plane!

, If you're comfortable with it, use the eye mask or earplugs, but most people find them uncomfortable.
 Be social! There are sure to be other kids like you who are bored.
,, Have you ever heard the phrase "A watched pot never boils?" That's what this phrase is referring to! If you watch the clock, it will seem to not move at all.
