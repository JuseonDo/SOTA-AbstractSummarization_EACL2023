 Don't let your unprotected hands near anything involved.;
, Alternating current will flow through a capacitor until the source of the current is removed. That current can add to the shock you'll get if you mishandle the capacitor, and may keep recharging it.
 Most capacitors are constructed of 2 conductive plates separated by an insulating plate; more complex capacitors feature multiple layers of metalized plastic. Big capacitors, the kind most likely to be dangerous, are usually cylindrical and look roughly like battery cells.
 This may prevent damage to the circuitry the capacitor was connected to when you discharge it.


If it is removable, it is probably very large and potentially very dangerous.
 Doing this will provide a path for the electricity to go and discharge the capacitor. You can use a 5- to 10-watt resistor, voltmeter, test light or ordinary light bulb.

Using a meter or light will show the progress of the discharging, either with a digital display or a progressively dimming bulb.
