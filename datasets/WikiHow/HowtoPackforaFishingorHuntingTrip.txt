 You should also take into account the season planned for your trip.


Know if your destination is prone to sudden weather changes, such as in the mountains. You may have to pack extra clothing and gear in these instances.;
, A few items of warm clothing and rain gear should be packed, even if it is supposed to be warm.


If it is a day trip, you will only need spare clothing for that day. If you are planning a 2- or 3-day trip, you will need at least two days of clothing.
 Remember to do this early, because licenses can be in high demand.
 If you will be fishing from a boat, check local laws for boat safety equipment you may need.


Check with an experienced hunter for the correct firearms and ammunition for the type of game you will be hunting. You can also bring call whistles or other hunting aids.
 You should also include an emergency weather radio and a first aid kit.
