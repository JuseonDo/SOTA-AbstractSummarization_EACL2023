@article
 Take an interest in your partner's life and feelings. Ask them how their day was or how they feel. Share your thoughts and feelings with them as well. Be sure they never feel abandoned and always talk to each other.;
, Your relationship will teach you your limitations, so accept them with open arms.
You will both eventually be wrong on something, regardless of your perceptions. Take responsibility for doing something wrong. Show that you regret your mistake and apologise if necessary.
Always apologise for mistakes or wrongdoings. However, a simple "I'm sorry" is not enough. Make an effort to avoid making the same mistake in the future.
 Think back to this time before confronting your partner.
Different perspectives are important as they allow for multiple sides to a decision or story. Listen to the position of your partner and share yours as well. Don't try to make yours seem more important than the other, as this is generally not true.
 Though shared interests are important, be sure to develop some of your own as well. You can learn from your experiences in ways that will help you with your relationship and future decisions.
 Responsibilities should never fall to a single person nor should one need to be asked to carry them out if they are known.
 Nobody is perfect. Laugh whenever you can.
Laugh with each other, not at each other. Mistakes are generally mutual, especially with joint decisions.
 If both share the goal of: making a happy marriage, you'll keep the love!
