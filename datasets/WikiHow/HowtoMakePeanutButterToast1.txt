 Toast to your preferred level of toasting. While you are waiting for the bread to toast, get ready a plate, butter knife, and the peanut butter.;
, Place them on the plate.
 Spread it on the toast as thickly or as thinly as you like.
 This step is optional but if you like it sweet, spread on a little honey or maple syrup. If you do add either sweetener, spread it on all over the toast to improve the flavor.
 Share with someone else if you like.


You can cut the toast into halves or quarters, as preferred, or leave whole.
