Place the connecting strip so that it holds the backing board and the lens holder at the correct focusing distance of the lenses. This is known as the â€œfocal length".
Put the separator between the lenses. This is to stop your eyes from looking at the photo on the other side.
 Use lenses with no more than a 2X magnification for normal-sized photographs. You can use greater magnifications for smaller pictures. You can even dismantle a cheap pair of reading glasses for the lenses if you cannot find any other source.
