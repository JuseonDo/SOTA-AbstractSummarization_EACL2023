 This should be the most overriding factor in your decision-making process. Not every region has a good school or region for every subject, but you should be willing to make sacrifices to attain your educational goals.;
, This can be difficult since China is a huge and diverse country. Do you like huge cities or small towns? Do you like coastal areas or mountain regions? What kind of climate do you prefer? Also keep in mind the linguistic differences that exist in different parts of China.
 If you already speak Chinese or are willing to spend a year or more improving your language skills, you can enroll in a program taught in Chinese. There are also some programs taught in English which require no Chinese ability whatsoever, but these are much fewer.
 Different programs have different requirements. Some programs will have practically no requirements while others can be quite stringent. Make sure you understand exactly what the requirements are before you apply to avoid wasting time and energy applying for something you don't qualify for.
 If you are applying directly to a Chinese institution however, you might encounter difficulties involving language, timely completion of paperwork and differing expectations of behavior between you and the Chinese institution you're applying for. It is strongly recommended that you use a third party admission service to expedite the application process.
 Depending on how long you'll be away, this could be as simple as arranging to have your lawn mowed while you're gone. For long-term stays, this could mean selling your car, saying farewell to friends and family and preparing for a new stage in life.
