 Don't punch any holes in the can, but remove the label.
 Shorter time = lighter/softer doce. Longer time = darker/firmer doce.
 While the cooker is pressurized by the steam, its pressure will counterbalance the pressure build up inside the can, and prevent it from exploding. Let everything cool down before opening the pressure cooker. If you attempt to open a hot, or even warm can, an extremely hot jet of doce may explode out and result in severe burns. Wait until it is cool; then it will be perfectly safe to open the can and enjoy this great dessert.
