@summary
figure out who is "it" and sit in a circle.

@summary
have the "king caller" (you'll need to decide who the king caller is too) say a random phrase.

@summary
,

@summary
as the person who is "it" lands on someone, he or she says a number and then counts to it.

@summary
the one who is "it" hides.

@summary
everyone looks for the person who is "it.",

@summary
make sure everyone runs to the designated "base"; they can make a chain if they'd like to.

@summary
if everyone makes it, the person who was "it" is "it" again.
@article
 Everyone should put his or her foot in.;
,, Whoever it lands on is "it."

, Then everyone counts "1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock rock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock rock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock rock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, LUNCHTIME! 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock rock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock rock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock rock, 10 o'clock 11 o'clock, 12 o clock MIDNIGHT!"

, Then, when someone sees him or her, the person who is "it" can't move and the person who is not "it" can't move until the person who is not "it" yells "BLOODY MURDER!"

, If you touch base, you can come off of it.
 If multiple people are tagged, the first person tagged is "it." If one person is tagged, then he or she is "it."
