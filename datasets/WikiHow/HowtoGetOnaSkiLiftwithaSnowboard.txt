 Unfasten or step out of your rear binding before you get on the chairlift. It must be your rear! Again, make sure your front binding is fastened tightly as well as making sure the leash is attached. Also, be sure to fold down the back part of the rear binding. This is to prevent it being broken by the weight of the chair when you sit down.






;
, Put the released foot to either side of the snowboard and push. This is called skating. It's like being on a skateboard. You push your rear foot to move and balance on your lead foot.
 Then move up to the gate and stop. There will be a red line indicating to you where to stop.
 Make sure the nose of your board is pointed "uphill". Then place your "free foot (back foot)" on the snow on the heel side of the board and stand in the most natural position you can.
 Bend your knees slightly, so that when the chair comes around it won’t knock you over. When it is right behind you, sit down on it and have the nose of your board still pointed "uphill".
,,, Make sure you don't hit anyone in the head when you do this. If the safety bar has footrests, you can rest your board on them.
 Lift up the safety bar. Point the nose of the board up so it doesn't accidentally get planted on the ground.
 At the exit point put your back foot on the stomp pad on your board which is right in front of your rear binding. Stand up and go straight. After you slow down skate out of the way of the lift and strap your rear foot back onto the board.









Don't attempt to turn while you are coming off the chairlift as it will risk the odds you fall down. Just go straight till you slow down naturally.
