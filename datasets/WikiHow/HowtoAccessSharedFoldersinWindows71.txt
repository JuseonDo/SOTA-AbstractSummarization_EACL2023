The system will create a homegroup password, which is a series of random letters and numbers. Click in the password field and create your own password.
Write down your password and keep it in a secure place.

Although the Homegroup will automatically share certain files, you can turn sharing on or off on specific folders.
 Select "Share With," and click "Homegroup." Do this with every folder you wish to share.
