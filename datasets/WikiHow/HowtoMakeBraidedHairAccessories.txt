 Remember that when you make a braid, each length of yarn will shorten considerably, so double the length at a minimum.;
, The three colors should complement or match each other and it's ideal if they are intended for certain color schemes within your own wardrobe.
 Place them side by side with care, so that they meet up together.
 This will keep the three lengths together evenly while braiding.
 Braid from the knot down the length of the yarn.
 This length can be ascertained from the length of the clip, barrette or other hair accessory you're going to be adding the design to.
 This will prevent the braid from unraveling. The braid piece is now ready to be attached to the hair accessory.
 If it isn't clean, remove any dust or grime first, and allow to fully dry before proceeding.
 Add glue to the accessory's surface first, then align the piece of braid to the surface. In some cases, you may find that it also helps to add the glue to the braid as well as to the surface of the hair accessory.


Be sure to use glue that is suitable for both the yarn (fabric) and for the hair accessory.
, This might be a spray-on varnish or a brush of Mod Podge. This is to protect the surface from wear and tear.
