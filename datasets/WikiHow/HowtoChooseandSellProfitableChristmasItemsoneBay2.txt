Check the classified ads in your local papers and online sites regularly, watching for profitable Christmas merchandise.
 Clean or wash your inventory. Test anything that is supposed to "work" by plugging it in and, if applicable, using it. If an item does not work, make the necessary repairs.

Keep your inventory list near your computer and keep it current as your inventory grows.
