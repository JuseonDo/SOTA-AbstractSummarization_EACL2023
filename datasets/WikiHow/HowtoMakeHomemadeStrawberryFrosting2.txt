 Add 1¼ cups (250 grams) of fresh, chopped strawberries and 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of granulated white sugar into a blender or food processor. Purée until smooth, about 10 seconds. From time to time, pause the blender/food processor, and scrape any large clumps down towards the bottom with a rubber spatula.
 Discard anything that gets caught in the sieve. You will end up with about ½ cup (120 milliliters) of strawberry purée., Bring the strawberry purée to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low. Let the purée simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it thickens. You will end up with about 3 to 4 tablespoons (50 to 60 milliliters) of strawberry purée., Pour the strawberry purée into a bowl, and let it reach room temperature before chilling it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Once the purée has chilled, measure out 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters). If you have any left over, you can store them in the fridge in a small bottle or jar.
 You can do this in a bowl using a handheld mixer. You can also use a stand mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks.
 You will end up using 3 to 4 cups (375 to 400 grams) of powdered sugar. The more sugar you add, the stiffer your frosting will be.
 This will take about 3 to 5 minutes. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, especially if you are using a handheld mixer.
 Vanilla extract can change the color of frosting. If this is an issue for you, use clear vanilla extract instead.
 If the frosting is too soft for you, cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap, and stick it in the fridge until it reaches the consistency you need. Check on it every 15 minutes.Store any unused frosting in the fridge, covered, for up to 1 week. Let it sit at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before you use it.
