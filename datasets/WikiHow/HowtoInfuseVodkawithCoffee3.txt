@summary
place the jar of coffee, vodka and syrup in a cool, dark place.

@summary
check the vodka daily to see if air has formed in the top of the jar.

after 5 days, taste the infusion.
@article
 Allow the jar to sit for at least 5 days.
 If it has, then top off the jar with more simple syrup.
 If the taste is strong enough, then you are ready to filter the vodka. If not, then infuse it for another couple of days.
