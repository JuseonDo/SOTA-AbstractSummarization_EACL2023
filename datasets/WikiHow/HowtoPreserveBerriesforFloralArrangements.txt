 The stem is essential for allowing the berries to be included in any floral arrangement.;
, This allows for maximum surface to uptake water.
 Let stand for several hours.
 The box will prevent the spray going over other surfaces.
 Be sure to get all of the berries and coat all surfaces evenly.
 This also gives additional preservation to the berries. Spray two layers, allowing for drying in between.
