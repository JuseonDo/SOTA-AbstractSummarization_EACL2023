it has been said, "pack a handgun for the unexpected, but if you know you'll be in a gunfight, always grab a bigger gun!",

the main advantages of long guns are power and accuracy.
@article
 Handguns lack power. A high-end .44 Magnum pistol will produce about 1,000 ft/lb of muzzle energy; a traditional "varmint" caliber, the .223, will produce about 50% more energy, and high-end rifles produce over 10,000 ft/lb!

, With a bit of practice, a decent shooter can hit a man sized target at greater than 300 yards (274.3Â m) with the proper rifle, due to the more powerful round, longer barrel and the longer sight-base (the distance between the front and rear sights).
