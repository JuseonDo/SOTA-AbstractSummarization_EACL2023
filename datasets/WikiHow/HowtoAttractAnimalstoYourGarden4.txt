 Keep your cats in at night and prevent dogs from chasing or attacking visiting animals. Not only is this important for the safety of the wildlife but the cats and dogs will be protected from getting such things as bites, scratches, intestinal worms, germ transference, etc.

 Grow plants that shelter and feed them.
