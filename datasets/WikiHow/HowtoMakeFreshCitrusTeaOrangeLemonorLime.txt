 There should be two for each glass. You can mix flavours if wished but it is a good idea to start with one flavour until you know which flavours that you prefer.;
, Allow to sit for a minute or two to allow the citrus oils to release and infuse the water.
 The tea should be weak to normal, not strong-tasting.
, Add a slice or two to the side of the glass and enjoy.
