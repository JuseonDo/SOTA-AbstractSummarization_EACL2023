 Even excursions as a class can form part of a SOLE investigation, such as museum or gallery visits.
 Help them to explore learning beyond the classroom and as part of their everyday lives.


You could even consider holding a SOLE information session for parents one evening. Show them how the SOLE works and give them some ideas for running SOLE activities in the home environment.






Encourage after-school programs within your school environment to follow SOLE activities as one of the options for children to pursue after class.
