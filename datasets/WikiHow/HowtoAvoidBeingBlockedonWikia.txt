;
, It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the wiki by reading a few of its articles before you begin editing. If you are aware of what the rest of the community want and don't want on the wiki, you are less likely to inadvertently upset the owner, admins or other users.
 If you are asked to stop by an admin, do not continue to do it. Wiki owners have the right to do what they want with the pages and it's policies.
, Do not presume that they are out to prevent you from editing. They are there to facilitate your experience.


Stay calm. Do not chat back or be rude. That soon turns into trolling and will get you blocked. It also resolves nothing.
If there is a misunderstanding, ask calmly for a link to the edit in question and then clarify why you made it. An owner or other admins can judge on the edits you've made to a page.
Remain civil, polite and do not use profanity.
