Change the border. You can change the look of the page by altering the width and the color of the border. You want to be sure that you find something that complements your work. You are not limited to the 40 colors that are displayed. To select another color, simply click on 'More Colors'.

Use a filter. You can change the coloring of your photos or add a vignette affect. Those are always nice.
