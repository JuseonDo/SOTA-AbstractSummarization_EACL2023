 Usually, teachers give a special topic to each student, or lets them pick.;
, You'll also need paint, glue, extra cardboard, cotton balls, an index card or two, pencil or pen, and tape.
 Remember that some teachers will request a specific position.
 If the scene is outdoors, remember to find the time of day and try to work with it.


To make trees, cut out the trunk from the extra cardboard, paint it brown. Then paint a cotton ball green and glue it to the top of the tree trunk.






To make boulders, either use cardboard to make it flat, or a painted cotton ball to it three dimensional.






To add a hill, find cardstock of the right size, bend the edges to be glued and press them to either the bottom of the box or the wall and glue them. Paint them from there.
, Once you're happy with their positions, glue them in.
