 Tinder pulls profile information from your Facebook account, so in order to change your age on Tinder, you'll need to change it on your Facebook profile.


You can only change your birthday on Facebook every so often, so if you've recently changed it you may not be able to.;
,, Double-check that your birthday updates to the new date. If you are unable to update your birthday, you likely updated it recently and Facebook is preventing you from changing it for a while.


Some users have reported being able to use this Facebook Help page to get their birthdays changed.
Make sure that your age is visible to your Facebook friends by clicking the privacy drop-down menu.
, This will open the Settings menu.
 You will be deleting your Tinder account, so you'll lose any matches and conversations you have.
