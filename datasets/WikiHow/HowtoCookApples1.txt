, Use a melon scoop or metal spoon to carve out the core; the hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Be sure to leave the bottom ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of the apples intact.Choose good baking apples, such as: Golden Delicious, Jonagold, or Rome Beauty., Use a sharp knife to draw a line around the apples, widthwise. Do this several times: near the top, around the middle, and towards the bottom. This will prevent the skin from breaking while the apple is baking., For fancier apples, you can also add some chopped pecans and/or chopped raisins.
 Each apple should get about 1 tablespoon of the mixture.
 Cut the butter into four, equal-sized cubes, then drop each cube on top of each apple. When the butter melts, it will mix with the sugar, and give you a delicious sauce.
 The hot water will help keep the bottom of the apples from burning. It will also mix with the juices released by the apples, and give you a sort of sauce.
 They are ready when the flesh turns tender, and is easily pierced with a fork.
 Take the apples out of the baking dish, and transfer them to a serving platter using a spatula. If you'd like, you can baste them with the juice collected at the bottom of the baking dish.
