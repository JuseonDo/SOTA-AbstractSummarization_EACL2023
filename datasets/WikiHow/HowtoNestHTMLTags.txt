@summary
understand what an html "tag" is.

@summary
nest the html tags.

@summary
if you want a font in two different sections of your webpage, and they are adjacent, just enclose both sections in the font tag.

@summary
get into this habit early when learning to properly code pages.

 An HTML tag or element is something that changes the formatting of an HTML webpage.

They are enclosed in triangular brackets: <> and </>.
They do everything from creating a marquee style scroll, to changing font size and color.;
, To properly nest the tags, you must properly close the tags. If you open a "head" tag and open a "title" tag, then before you can move on to the "body" tag", you must close the "title" tag.


An HTML element will not work if the tags are incorrectly nested. There are no exceptions.
 If they aren't adjacent, then you'll just have to use the tag twice.

For example: <TAG1><TAG2><TAG3></TAG3></TAG2></TAG1>

, If you do so, soon it will become second nature to you.
