 This dungeon is for level 60 and up.;
, Go in with some friends because the waterworks is really hard.
 The first two are mob floors. The next one is the hardest, but it isn't a battle. Open up the clams, but only the blue ones. Don't open up the yellow clams.
 Do not add any traps on him unless it's the storm trap like windstorm. You must use anÂ all enemy attack if you want to single attack.
 He is balance, but the last person is never inked. Let the life wizard go last if he/she's is good at healing if you're last and not life. Do not use traps.
 This floor contains 2 death mobs and 2 fire mobs.
 There is no timer, just follow the eel. If you activate the wrong lever, you're gonna have to fight 4 storm mobs with cheating skills.
 There are 2 fire mobs and 2 lives. Take them out easily. Don't get confused by the moon icon; they're still fire.
 After this floor, go to the start and activate the valve.
 You should now get the cape and boots.
