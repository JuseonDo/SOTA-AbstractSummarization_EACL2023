 Viruses do not respond to antibiotics, which are only effective against bacterial infections. If the person concerned has not been vaccinated or presents secondary symptoms as described above, treat them as though you were treating a person with a life-and-death syndrome of influenza. Hydration and providing the person with basic nutrients are best in the case of any major viral illness, with hydration being the top priority.
, Although most occurrences of this viral disease are generally spread throughout the continents of South America and sub-Saharan Africa, measures below should be taken to ensure that any person traveling to these areas be immunized via vaccination from this preventable, potentially lethal disease prior to traveling.
 The required documentation, provided at the time of vaccination, is called the International Certificate for Vaccination and Prophylaxis against Yellow Fever. See the table below to find out if you are traveling to a country that requires vaccination prior to entry.


Access to the the countries listed in the table below will likely be denied to travelers without this certificate.
 State health departments are responsible for designating non-federal yellow fever vaccination centers and issuing Uniform Stamps to health-care providers.


Information about the location and hours of yellow fever vaccination centers may be obtained by contacting local or state health departments or visiting CDC’s Travelers’ Health website.
