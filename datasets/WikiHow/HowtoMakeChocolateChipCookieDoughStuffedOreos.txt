 Using an electric mixer or spoon, combine the butter and brown sugar in a small bowl.;

 The cookie dough will become dry and crumbly; this is normal. Mix until there are no "clumps" of flour in the bowl.
 The dough should stick together once the milk is mixed in, and resemble cookie dough.
, Something like a clean, flat countertop or a chopping board is best.
 Separate the cookie dough into small pieces and use your hands to roll it into small balls. It's also possible to use a melon baller or mini ice cream scoop to scoop out small balls of cookie dough.


You may want to place the cookie dough balls into a bowl to ensure that they don't roll away.

,, Flatten it down with the cookie, but be careful not to press too hard.
, Place the cookie-dough-stuffed Oreos on a plate. Serve with a glass of milk, if desired.
