,,,, CardDAV is an address book communication standardthat Google recommends using to sync Apple contacts.
 Enter google.com in the Server field. If you have 2 Step verification enabled (meaning you require a special code that is sent to your phone to log in), you will need to generate and enter an application specific password.,, The switch next to the Contacts option should be green.
