 Find space on the putting green around a hole.


Set up four golf balls around the hole. The balls should be equal distance from the hole. Your goal is to get them all into the hole.
Each time you make them all into the hole, move them a foot further from the hole. If you mess up, you have to start all over. , Set up a coin about a foot in front of the ball and putt over the coin. Try to get the ball to go right over the coin. You can use a flat stick to guide your path to the coin if you need to. This drill will help improve your accuracy when putting. , The goal of this drill is to put the ball in a three-foot range of the hole to be able to make a two putt. If you make a two putt, then give yourself three points. If you make it within the three-foot circle give yourself one point. This way you will be able to track your progress. , This will help you relieve your mind and not worry about the ball or the hole or your putt. Putting with your eyes closed works best for short putts.
