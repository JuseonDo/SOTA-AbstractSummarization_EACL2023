, Nippers will provide a much safer and cleaner cut for your tile. If using a hammer, always wear safety glasses and use a towel or other cloth to cover the plate or tile while breaking it.
 Never use an older, dirty one even if you have cleaned it, since there will continue to be both dirt residue and moisture in the terra cotta which will affect the curing of the adhesive.
 This will keep moisture from being drawn out of the adhesive during the curing process.
 Mortar is the most reliable adhesive to use for outdoor areas or areas that are in contact with moisture. Mastic is not a good adhesive for this purpose as it does not adhere well over the long term. Never use any "pre-mixed" thin set product. It has a curing retardant in it in order to keep it from curing on the shelf and this means your mosaic will not cure properly in a decent amount of time.
 Only work in areas you can finish at one time. Alternately you can place a small amount of mortar on the back of each piece as you set it. Make sure you are using enough mortar to hold the piece down but not so much that it squishes up into the spaces between the tiles where the grout will go.
 You may draw the pattern onto the pot ahead of time with a pencil and follow the lines.
 This usually is after 72 hours.
, Otherwise, sealant is unnecessary.
