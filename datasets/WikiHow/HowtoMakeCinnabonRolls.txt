 Stir and combine the ingredients until the sugar has dissolved. Set the bowl aside for now.;
, Read and follow the directions on the package. Mix the salt, margarine, and eggs in the pudding mix. Add the yeast mixture last and blend everything well together.
 It's highly recommended to add one cup of flour, mix, and then put in another cup. It's easier to mix all of the flour in with this method rather than dumping the entire 6 cups of flour at once.
, Let the dough rise until it doubles in size. Gently deflate the dough down by kneading it again once or twice, then allow it to rise again. (Gently deflating the dough will yield a better texture in the final product than harsher handling does.) 

, Use the cup of softened butter and spread it (either with your hand or a knife) on the dough. 

,,,, Go back and cut the dough in pieces, using your indentations as "markers". 

, Lightly press down on each piece with your hand. Let the pieces rise one more time. 

, Remove from the oven when they are a golden brown color.
 To make the frosting:


Combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl. 
Mix until you get a smooth consistency.
 They are best eaten on the day of baking.
