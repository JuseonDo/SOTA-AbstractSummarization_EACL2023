 For example, if you are taking a Regents in Biology, find your biology notebook. Clean it out; remove work from other classes, doodles, and other, unimportant things.;
, Include answer keys or Scantron sheets. Place these in a folder or a separate section of your binder.
 The company Barron's makes them in almost every subject. They are about $15 each, so talk to an older friend or family member who might already have a book in the subject you are looking for.
 The first things you study should be the things you learned in the beginning of school, since that's what you have most likely forgotten.
, Just make sure you know how to read every single thing on the reference tables. Many of your answers will come right off the tables.
