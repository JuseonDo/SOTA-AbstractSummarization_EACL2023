sit in a comfortable position, preferably with both feet planted on the ground (though this is not required).

@summary
visualize.

@summary
pull on the tube and discover that one end is securely tied to the center of the earth.

@summary
examine the connection closely, make sure there are no leaks and that the tube is securely fastened.

@summary
once connected, imagine that all foreign energy (belonging to other sources, people, thoughts) or negative feelings/thoughts are personified in your body by a color.

@summary
imagine all energy in your body of this color being sucked down the tube connected to you and into the center of the earth where it is cleansed by the heat and plasma.

@summary
next, destroy your tube and watch it disappear.

@summary
imagine that you have a magnet that attracts only your energy.

@summary
write your name under the magnet to claim this as yours and only yours.

@summary
,

@summary
now watch as the magnet attracts your energy.

@summary
imagine poking a hole in the top of your head, and then poking a hole in the enlarged sun.
@article
 Take several deep breaths and turn inward.;
, With eyes closed imagine that under your chair is a rope that is hollow in the middle. Visualize (and act out if needed), reaching under your chair to grab one end of the rope. Imagine looking through the hollow center. Focus on colors, the texture and how the image of this "tube" makes you feel.


If you get any negative feelings when viewing this tube, or find it hard to concentrate, imagine/visualize the tube being destroyed by any means that come to you. (i.e. turning into sand and blowing away, blowing up, expanding and exploding) Now see that a newer, cleaner tube is created with this action.
 Take the other end and attach it to your base chakra (an energy center), located at the base of your spine.
 If you can't, again destroy the tube and try again.
 Use whatever color comes naturally.
 Watch as it is released and returned to it's natural source.
 Imagine a bright and hot sun approaching you at eye level. Feel the heat and brightness from this object.
 Your energy has been dispersed throughout the Universe and this magnet is going to help you call it back. Stick this magnet to the sun in front of you.
, Take note of the color with which it appears. Watch as the sun fills with this energy and grows until you think it may explode.
 Tip the sun so that your clean energy spills through the hole. Watch as it fills your feet, legs, midsection, neck and head. Feel it flow out your hands like fountains. Watch the energy spill out the top of your head and fill your aura surrounding your body.


You have successfully grounded yourself of negative energy and called back your energy! Notice how you feel...are you feeling more centered and focused?
