@summary
get through almost the entire level but don't go into the room that finishes the level or else you won't be able to do this glitch.

@summary
where the big hole is in the wall that ends the mission, stand directly in front of it and walk backwards and look to your left side.

You should be in a cave like mining place with a lot of wood everywhere supporting it.



If you did it correctly, you should see what looks like some wooden boards nailed to the sides of a pathway. Take a grenade (it doesn't matter what kind) and throw it as close as possible to the boards and it should blow up.
 Keep going in.

You should see a bunch of people including Tanya, the Australian guy and some Germans break dancing.






Where the music equipment is playing at, there should be an M1919A6 Browning.30 on the ground.
