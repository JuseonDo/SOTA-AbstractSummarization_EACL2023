, You will need either 3 A levels and 5 GCSE's at grade A-C including maths, science and english, or an access to HE course if you are a mature student with no recent qualifications. Access to health course is the same as having just over 3 A levels.
 Universities like their students to have a little work experience.
 This is what will make you stand out from the rest of the applicants. Tell them why you want to be a midwife, what you have to offer, and any work experience you might have. Try to make your personal statement worth reading. But don't ramble on about your favourite TV show or your favourite food as they will not want to know.
 It will be a 3 year degree course as the diploma has been phased out. It is going to be a lot of hard work, but if it what you want then go for it.
