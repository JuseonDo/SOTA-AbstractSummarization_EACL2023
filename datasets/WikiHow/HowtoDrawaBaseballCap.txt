 This will be the part of the hat that will rest on your head.
 To do so, first draw a rectangle, then add a small triangle beneath it. Also draw a small half-oval on top of the semicircle you drew in step one.
 This includes the curve of the visors and the division of the base (see image).
 Erase the sketch.
 You're done!
