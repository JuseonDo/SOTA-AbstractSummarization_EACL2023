 For this example, a letter for John Smith is being sent to his workplace, wikiHow. Because wikiHow is responsible for passing the letter on to John, it is in their care. The c/o goes before "wikiHow," and not John's name, as follows:


John Smith
C/O wikiHow
250 EMERSON ST.
PALO ALTO, CA 94301

, If John Smith is staying with his cousin Jane Doe, then it is her responsibility to make sure the mail gets to him. The care of symbol (c/o) will go before her name.


John Smith
C/O Jane Doe
543 MAIN ST
APT. 12
CHICAGO, IL 60601

, Postcards, letters, and packages all require different stamps, and the cost of international mail can vary. If you are unsure how much it will cost to send your letter or package, bring it to the post office and they will make sure you get the right stamps.


A standard letter is under 13 oz. in the United States and requires one $.49 stamp., If, for some reason, the letter is undeliverable, it will be sent to the return address listed.
