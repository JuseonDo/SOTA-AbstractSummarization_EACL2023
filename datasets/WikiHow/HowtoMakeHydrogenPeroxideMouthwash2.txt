 Use only filtered or distilled water.You can also use peppermint or spearmint hydrosol instead for a minty flavor.Avoid using plastic bottles, as the essential oils can cause the plastic to degrade over time.
 It is very important that you use 3% hydrogen peroxide; anything higher could damage your teeth. Most grocery stores sell 3% hydrogen peroxide, however., Peppermint or spearmint would work the best for mouthwash.You can try another type, such as: clove, grapefruit, lemon, rosemary, or sweet orange.Mixing 1 tablespoon (22.5 grams) of honey into the essential oil will help emulsify it.Skip this step if a child will be using the mouthwash., Keep in mind that you will need to shake the bottle each time before you use the mouthwash., Give the mouthwash a shake, then swish and gargle a capful in your mouth for 2 minutes. Spit the mouthwash out, then rinse your mouth with water.Do not swallow the mouthwash.
Store the mouthwash in a cool, dark place.
