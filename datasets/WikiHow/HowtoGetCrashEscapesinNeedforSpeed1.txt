 You can launch the game from the Start menu (Start button >> All Programs >> Electronic Arts >> Need for Speed Most Wanted) or from the desktop by double-clicking its icon.


When the game finishes loading, it will launch directly into the game world, into the streets of a fictional city named Fairhaven.;
, Use the Up Arrow key to accelerate, and the Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left and right, respectively.
 Use the Down Arrow key to brake and stop your current car.
, This will display the EasyDrive menu.


The Easy Drive menu is a feature in modern NFS games that allows you to easily find racing locations and apply upgrades to your car.
 A list of available races will be displayed.
, This will highlight the route to the race’s location on the your mini map.


The minimap is a compressed version of the city’s map that is displayed on the left bottom of your screen.
 Use the highlighted route on the minimap as a guide.
 The marker would be a glowing icon on the road.
 Now the race will begin.
 This is the only way to get Crash Escapes in NFS: MW (2012)—you have to drive past not just any car, but one that has crashed.


There is a section of the race where you will go offroad and speedily go up a hill before jumping over a highway. It is especially important that you have two opponents ahead of you by the time you get to this section.
 Do this by pressing the Shift keywhile still accelerating (Up Arrow key). Your opponents will Crash down onto the highway, enabling you to register two Crash Escapes as you jump over them and reconnect with the road.


Nitro is a racing tool in the game that gives you an instantaneous boost of acceleration.
You may need to repeat the race a few times in order to be ready for the offroad hill part. If you fail to get your Crash Escapes after the first trial, press Num 6 to bring up the EasyDrive menu again, and select the race.
