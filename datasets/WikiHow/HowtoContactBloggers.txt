 It's a pretty simple thing to do, given that you don't even need any kind of account to do so. You have the option of appearing as anonymous, or using a variety of different accounts that you may already have. It takes all of two seconds to do, it's convenient and a great starting point.;
, Most blogs will display a series of pages at the top of the home page. Often you can find one which will say "Contact Me" or something similar, or perhaps even an "About" page.
 Most bloggers have an account on Twitter which is a good way to get in contact, especially to start with.
 All you have to do is enter their URL with /ask at the end- simple!

, You can try entering their blog's title into Twitter if they don't link to it; or if you have their name, you could also try searching it on Twitter or Facebook. Be warned, however, that this won't necessarily work.
 You could try going onto their profile and checking for an email address, or an account on another site. You can easily find it on their home page, typically in a sidebar, and any information they've made available to the general public is easy to find.
