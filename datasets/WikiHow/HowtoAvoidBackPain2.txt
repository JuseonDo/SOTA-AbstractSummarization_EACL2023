 Will you need help lifting it? If so, get the help you need. Is there a hand jack or other tool you might use to move it and save yourself from lifting it? If so, take advantage of it and avoid potential strain.


Know your limits and strength level before attempting to lift something that could be too heavy.
If you can push or pull a given object, push it. Pulling objects can strain your back.
 Place one leg slightly ahead of you. Lower yourself, bending at the knees, and keep your back straight up and down. Tighten your stomach muscles.
 Push off the ground with your feet and rise slowly, keeping your back straight.Keep the load close to your waist. If possible, keep the object lengthwise across your waist or in a vertical position rather than extending out from your waist. Try to keep the weight even.


Do not twist, lean, or turn your hips or back while holding a heavy object.
