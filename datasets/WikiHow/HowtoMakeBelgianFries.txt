,, This way the most of the starch will be removed and it makes the fries more crispy and delicious.
, Pour the oil in a deep fryer and set at a temperature from 160°C (320°F). Do not overload the deep fryer otherwise, your fries will stick together and they will be not that tasty. Fry the fries for about 8 minutes (depending on how thick they are).
 The kitchen paper will absorb the excess oil. Leave the fries alone for about 20 minutes.
 Set the temperature from the deep fryer at a temperature from 190°C (375°F), and fry them for about 2-4 minutes till they are crispy and golden brown. And lay them into the bowl with a new piece of kitchen paper, so that it can absorb the excess oil again.
