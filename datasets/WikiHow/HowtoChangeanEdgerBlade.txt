 This step will ensure safety during this installation.
 The blade has a free rotation, and you must lock the spindle in order to remove the bolt. You can do this by locating the hole in the spindle which will lock the rotation., Check to make sure the spindle is locked and there is no rotation., To determine the direction to loosen the spindle nut, the spindle washer, located underneath the nut, will indicate the tightening direction. In this case, the direction to tighten is counter clock wise, so to loosen we will go clockwise., This is done by the control lever on the head of the ratchet.

Switch ratchet to opposite mode (counter clockwise) to tighten the nut.
 Lift the old blade off the spindle. The blade is normally dull, but do not take any chances and proceed with caution. The blade can be thrown away or recycled. Save the spindle nut and washer and keep in a safe place as we will use these with the new blade., The blades normally come in a pack of two. Use the box cutter to slice the packaging material. Carefully remove the blade you can save the label. This will help you identify for the blade next year., Make sure there is no dirt or other debris that will prevent the new blade from seating properly over the hub., Make sure the whole blade seats properly on spindle. As long as the blade is over the hub, and centered, it is properly placed., Reminder: the direction to tighten spindle nut is on your spindle washer. Please note this direction for the next step., Hand tighten until the nut is set and accurately secured. Finish tightening nut with ratchet., Test your edger in a safe area while wearing protective eye wear and closed toed shoes. After each use of your edger check the blade to ensure that the spindle nut is tight, and that there is no sever damage to your blade.
