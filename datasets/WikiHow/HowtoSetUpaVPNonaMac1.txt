 Once you enter the VPN settings into the Network panel of System Preferences, it’ll be easy to connect to the VPN. These settings are provided by your admin or service provider.


As of macOS Sierra, the native VPN app no longer supports PPTP VPN.If you have Sierra and your service requires PPTP, see Using Shimo on macOS Sierra.;
,,,, The button is blue and has two arrows, and will expand a brief menu.
,, Your VPN provider should specify this in their instructions.If you haven’t yet signed up for VPN service, see Getting a VPN for tips on selecting a provider.
 Type it into the “Service Name” field. This will be the nickname for this connection.
 Now you’ll see the VPN settings for this new connection in the right panel.
 Type this into the “Server Address” field.
 This goes into the “Account Name” field.
,, Use the instructions from your VPN provider to determine the correct choice.If you connect with a regular username and password, try selecting “Password” and then enter your password into the blank.
,,,, Now you should see a new icon in the menu bar at the top of the screen (near the clock). This is the VPN status icon, and you can use it to connect and disconnect from the VPN.
, The system will now connect and authenticate to the VPN server.
