 There are several ways to achieve a delicious result from a pork roast recipe, so choose what is preferable for your meal.


Cook the pork roast in the oven on 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). Cooking time will be 35 minutes per lb. (0.45kg) of meat. A pork roast with the bone in will cook faster than a boneless roast. It will result in a crispier surface texture with less moisture. This is an ideal method if you want to make gravy.
Cook the pork roast in a slow cooker, for the most tender roast. Place the brown roast in the slow cooker for approximately 6 hours on low. If your roast is extremely large, you may want to cut it into a few pieces. Always reduce the amount of liquid you add to the slow cooker, unless the recipe is intended for crock pot use.
Cook the pork roast in a Dutch oven on your stove top. You will want to bring all the ingredients, including the added liquid, to a boil. Then, turn down the temperature and cook covered on low for 2.5 to 3 hours.
