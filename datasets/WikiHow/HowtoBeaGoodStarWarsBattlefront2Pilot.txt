,, If they are go to step 4, if not go to step 5.
 Once you are in range hit it with your full load of bombs, this will destroy it and you will have just saved your hangar from invasion. If the dropship gets into your hangar look at the tips for info on how to deal with it.
 Do your best not to die while attacking, since once you destroy two frigates you will get the War Hero award which will increase the damage you do.
 If they are outside of their capital ship go to step 7, if not go to step 8.
 Once you exit your ship, destroy it. You can grab one of their ships, and leaving your ship will only alert your foes. Once inside, refill you ammo supplies and destroy their shields, then target their engines, and life support. Once you finish with them, destroy their auto-turret controls. (Note: If you are playing with cheats such as invincibility and unlimited ammo, you can leave your ship intact. This will attract enemies to the open hangar, where you can easily slaughter them).
, I prefer the Republic Starfighter and the TIE Intercepter, but any will do.
