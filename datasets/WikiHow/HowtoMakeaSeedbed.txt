 If you have a short vegetable growing season, you should make your seedbed inside a greenhouse. You may need to bring in soil and compost from outside into your greenhouse.;
, Seeds require plenty of light, so the seedbed should be placed in an area with the most consistent light and the fewest shadows.
 If these are big risks in your yard, consider purchasing or making a small plastic hoop house in which the seeds can be protected.
 The tuber roots and the weeds can crowd out the seedlings.
 Break up the soil with a rake. Allow sticky, soaked soil to dry out before.
 Add compost, if it is sandy or it has low nutrient value. Add store-bought sandy soil if there is so much organic matter in your soil that it sticks together.


Aim for a consistency of breadcrumbs in your final soil mix., Pick out weeds and debris. Pace the soil mix in a garden sieve with one-quarter inch (0.6cm) holes through which you can shake the soil., Spread it onto the area until it is level. Use the back of a garden rake to level and pat it down lightly.
 Try sprinkling it first to break the surface tension. Then, water more deeply.
 Flies are attracted to fresh soil and they will disappear during this time. Weed the area if weeds germinate during this process.


The plastic sheet will serve to warm up the soil for better germination.
 Fill with beer. Slugs will be attracted to the yeast and will drown in the beer.Check it regularly if you have problems with slugs.
 These are small “v” shaped lines in your seedbed, which you can use to separate seedlings.


Using drills allows you to recognize the plants amidst weeds and other plants.
 Seeds need moist soil to germinate.
 Plant them according to the seed package directions for starting seeds.
 Pat it down with the other side of your rake.
, This will keep your seedbed from overcrowding before you transplant. Compost the unwanted seedlings.
