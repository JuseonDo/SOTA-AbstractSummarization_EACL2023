 You should search for large stencils, rather than smaller ones, in order to create a noticeable design that stands out as soon as you enter the room. It may be easiest to use stencils specifically made for use with wall paint, since they usually come in finished designs.
 Painters tape is strong enough to hold the stencil in place but will not ruin the paint already on the wall.
 You may use standard wall paint, but acrylic craft paint will likely be more cost-effective, especially if you plan on using multiple colors.
 Coat the roller in your paint and roll the paint over the entire stencil until the entire design has been filled in.
 A stubby stenciling brush works best and creates an "orange peel" finish, a slightly bumpy texture that mimics the texture of an orange peel.
, Opt for a satin finish over a glossy one. Allow the sealer to dry, and air the room out before moving your child's belongings back into the room.
