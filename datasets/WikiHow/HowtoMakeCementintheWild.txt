 You can use many different items to make cement, such as:

A soft rock named limestone.
Many easy to recognize and find items such as sea shells including oyster, sea stars, reef corals and mollusks, crab shells.
Bones of animals, fish, birds, etc.
Chalk.;
,

Make a strong fire.
 Stack rocks on top of each other around the fire with an opening on the front and top (make it look like a fireplace),

Be sure that the metal container is not your food container. You can't reuse this container for anything else. It will only serve as a trash bid after this process.
If you don't have any metal containers, place your items on a large flat rock.
 To help make your shells or other cement into a more consistent sand, stir it every 30 minutes by mixing the shells (just like cooking).


Important: If some of your shells or other raw materials do not break down to the size of sand or smaller, remove them before sealing the cement inside an airtight container.
You can reheat them in the next batch.


Hide the cement in a dry airtight bucket with a lid. Store at room temperature in a dry location.
