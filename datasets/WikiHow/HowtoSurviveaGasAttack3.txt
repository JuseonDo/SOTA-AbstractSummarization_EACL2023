@summary
be aware of a usually colorless gas that smells like mustard, garlic, or onions--but note it doesn't always have an odor.

@summary
move from the area from where it was released onto higher ground, as mustard gas is heavier than air.

@summary
remove all clothing that may have been exposed to the gas, being sure not to let the clothes touch your face or head.

@summary
rinse any exposed parts of your body with plain water.

@summary
call emergency services and wait for help to arrive.

@article
 If you are exposed to mustard gas, you may notice the following symptoms but they may not appear until 2 to 24 hours after exposure:redness and itching of skin, eventually changes to yellow blistering
irritation of eyes; if exposure is severe, there may be light sensitivity, severe pain, or temporary blindness
irritation of respiratory tract (runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough)

,, Cut the clothes off so that they don't need to make additional contact with your skin as they're peeled off. Seal the clothes in plastic bags., Eyes should be flushed for 10-15 minutes. Don't cover them with bandages; however, sunglasses or goggles are fine.,
