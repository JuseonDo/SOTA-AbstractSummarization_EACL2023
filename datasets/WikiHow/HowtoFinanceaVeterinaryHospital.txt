 Don't empty out your emergency fund and retirement savings, however. If you have a cash flow that goes above and beyond your retirement and emergency funds, then consider using this amount to get your business up and running.;
, Meet with your financial institute and discuss your options. You can get an equity line of credit or a loan. The former will allow you the flexibility of having access to cash only when it is needed, whereas the latter is like a traditional loan that requires repayment on a monthly schedule. The benefit of tapping into your equity in these ways is that you will be borrowing at a lower interest rate. Just remember that a home equity loan does put your home at risk if your business does not do well.
 You will likely have to put something up as collateral. Many banks are reluctant to lend to small businesses, so put together a business plan in order to convince the bank that your business is worth the investment.
 Microloans typically exist for borrowers who cannot get a conventional loan.
 These loans can be made for high loan amounts. Find out if you are eligible for SBA financing for a veterinary hospital.
 Credit cards are a convenient way of making and managing your purchases. Understand the small print when it comes to interest, finance charges and annual fees. Choose a credit card with air miles, bonus points or cash back benefits. Note that the interest for credit cards is higher than an equity loan, so be prudent when making purchases.
