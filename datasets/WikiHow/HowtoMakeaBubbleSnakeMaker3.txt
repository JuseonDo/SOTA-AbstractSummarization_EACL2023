 Allow the fabric to absorb the soap and water without over-soaking the fabric (or it will become heavy and too soggy to create bubbles).



Instruct children to gently blow in a steady stream to achieve a constant, consistent flow of bubbles.
If the fabric becomes too saturated with bubble mixture, remove it, wring out and replace.
 Blow as many bubbles as you wish, adding more bubble mixture if needed.
