get denied!,

@summary
new or transfer students: if you apply to umd as an engineering major and you meet the requirements for new or transfer students to get into umd but you don’t meet the requirements for the engineering lep, you’ll get a nice acceptance letter.

@summary
current umd students: after you become a maryland student you can only apply to the engineering lep one (more) time.

@summary
apply: submit an online application to the clark school.

@summary
appeal!,

@summary
consider the following tactics for putting your appeal together:

@summary
,

@summary
write a simple, clear letter in business format (to be emailed).

@summary
if you have any related work experience, draft a current resume with the clark school of engineering in mind.

@summary
,

@summary
schedule an appointment at the umd writing center and have someone there proofread your letter and resume.

@summary
,

@summary
gather two or three letters of recommendation from professors, employers, or graduate students.

@summary
compile your documents and submit them exactly as instructed by the denial email you received.

@summary
be persistent: if enough effort is made on your behalf by other students and faculty to persuade the associate dean to let you in, they just might get fed up and give you a shot.

 Before appealing the Engineering LEP decision, you have to get them to make a decision. The decision of whether or not to admit a student into the Engineering LEP is based on a few simple criteria. If you fall on the borderline of meeting the requirements you will be very likely denied on your first try, so go ahead and get started on Step 2. If you are already a student at UMD, skip to step 3.;
, Before you get excited and tell all your friends, check what major your nice acceptance letter says you have. If it says “LTSC Undecided,” then you didn’t meet the requirements for the Engineering LEP, but you still got into the University. Follow the instructions from the LTSC advising department, and sign up for as many classes as you can that will be useful towards the engineering major you so desperately want. After your first semester at UMD, go to step 3.
 The soonest you can apply is after one semester at Maryland, and you may not hear back before the next semester starts. Before you apply to the Clark School (again), try to predict whether or not your only remaining application will be denied. The Engineering LEP’s Transfer Coordinator should be able to help you guess what your final admission decision will be. The Transfer Coordinator is especially helpful if you have repeated any classes, which can cause you to be denied in certain cases. The Coordinator cannot, however, compute your official GPA. Your official GPA from any courses outside Maryland is computed by the Office Undergraduate Admissions. The Office of the Registrar then combines that with any courses you take at Maryland for your overall GPA. After checking your official GPA, if it looks you’re going to be denied because of your classes or grades at another school, you might want to check that they’re correct (see the Tips section).
 The deadlines are given here for Spring and Fall. Be sure to take the opportunity to practice your professional writing skills by including a resume and personal statement with your application. Your written statements will probably not carry as much weight as your grades, but take your time and use every opportunity to demonstrate your abilities. Now, sit back and hope for denial so you can begin the magical appeal process!

, Find out exactly why you were denied: You should receive an email within two weeks of the application deadline. The email will give detailed reasons for your denial and a link to the online appeal form. You must follow any instructions in this email exactly.
, Argue why you should be allowed to enter the Engineering LEP. Carefully address each reason that was listed in the email you received.
,, The letters should be from people you have known for at least two years. Proofread the letters of recommendation to make sure no-one is playing a nasty trick on you.
 Print everything out, take it to the Post Office, and send it Certified Mail to the Associate Dean of the engineering department as a backup.
 Students in the past have reported actual success with this somewhat underhanded tactic of constant badgering (see Figure 1).
