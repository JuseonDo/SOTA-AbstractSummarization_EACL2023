 The top layer is often made of vinyl and should pull off easily. Once the top layer is off, the backing paper remains. If the sheet tears, find a new corner and start over.
 Apply warm water with a rag, sponge, or paint roller (for hard-to-reach places).
 Use a plastic putty knife to scrape the sticker areas.
 Clean with soap and hot water, rinse, and then dry with a clean towel or rag.
