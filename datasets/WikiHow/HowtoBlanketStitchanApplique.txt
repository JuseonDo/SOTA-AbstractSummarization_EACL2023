 Cut the piece to the size and shape you want. You can leave the edges raw if the fabric doesn't fray too much (or if you want that look), or you can turn them.You can also press the fabric to fusible web and cut both together. Fusible web will make the piece a bit easier to handle and it will make it more likely to lie flat.
 You will work the stitch from the front of the piece., Work this part a short distance from the edge of the applique.
 Try to get it at the edge of the applique piece or just slightly underneath.
, If you caught the thread from the previous stitch correctly, this stitch should hold a bit of thread along the edge of the applique.
