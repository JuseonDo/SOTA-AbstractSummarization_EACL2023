 Fill a pot with water and place it on your stovetop. Turn the heat on high until the water comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer., Grip your garment firmly, so you donâ€™t drop it in the water. Waft the area with the water stain through the steam created by the boiling water. It is not necessary to continue steaming your garment for more than a minute.Be careful not to burn yourself or the garment with the steam. Moving the fabric back and forth through the steam will help you avoid burns.
 Place a clean, white towel on a flat surface. Arrange your steamed silk garment into its designed shape and lie it on the towel. Allow it to dry thoroughly.If the stain does not go away, reheat your water until it is creating steam and repeat the process.
