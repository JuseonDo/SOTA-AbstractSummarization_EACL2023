These are the options that you will see on your own images. What you will see on images that aren't yours will vary.
 This will catch visitor's eyes and interest.
 This increases the odds of them coming up in searches.
 If you have flowers, there are many flower groups, or macros, DIY, etc.
 Sets are usually images that follow a common theme and then they will be found by others with that interest.
 This gets your name out there and encourages networking.
