 They should be appropriately sized so that two can fit in one hand. Bean bags, hacky-sacks, baseballs, or rocks all work fine.;
, Juggling over a bed or couch works well because you don't have to keep picking them up off the ground.
 One ball should be on the palm; the other on the fingers. You will throw the ball on the fingers first.
 Angle it a bit to the outside in a plane parallel to the front of your body.

Each ball should travel in an arc, rising near the center of your body, and falling near the outside by your dominant hand. They follow each other and, as you develop consistency, they will track the same trajectory. Strive to keep the balls the same distance from your body, the heights consistent, and the trajectories very close to the same.
 The release will be farther away from your body and the catch closer. Use your fingers to toss the forward ball backwards slightly, and simultaneously, with the palm of your hand, push the ball in your palm forward into your fingers, and catch the ball in the air with your palm., For this, toss the ball in your palm up and slightly forward and, simultaneously, with your fingers, push the ball in your fingers back into your palm, then catch the ball in the air with your fingers.
