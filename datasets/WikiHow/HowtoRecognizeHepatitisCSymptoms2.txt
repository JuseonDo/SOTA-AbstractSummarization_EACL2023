@summary
have a hepatitis c antibody test.

@summary
take an rna test.

@summary
use genotype testing to look to test for hepatitis c. these tests look at the actual genetic structure of hepatitis c so that you can best understand exactly what type of the disease you have, which can affect the treatments you need to undergo.
@article
 This test screens for infection by testing for the presence of antibodies of the disease, indicating your body is trying to fight the virus. This test is useful because it can tell whether you have an active bout of the infection your body is dealing with, or whether you previously had the disease.There is recent evidence that a weak positive may set off a false positive of the test. So depending on the level of the antibodies, you may want to be retested.Most patient that contract hepatitis C develop antibodies two to six months after exposure to the virus.
 This is a test that looks at genetic material (RNA) of the virus. This is used to measure the viral load in your body. This is a very accurate test and is typically only done if the Hepatitis C antibody test is positive, unless acute infection or recent exposure is suspected.


Other types of viral load tests include: TMA (transcription mediated amplification), PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and bDNA (branched DNA), with the latter being the least sensitive., There are seven different genotypes of the Hepatitis C virus. The genotype is important because it will dictate the type and length of treatment, as well as the likelihood of a cure.
