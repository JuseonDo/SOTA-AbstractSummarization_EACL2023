@summary
for this method, if you're using multiple cuts of meat (or ground meat) in the package, you'll need to take care to keep the paper pressed tight against all sides of the meat.

@summary
set the meat in the upper right corner of the paper.

@summary
fold the end of the corner over the meat and flip the meat over towards the center.

@summary
along one side of the meat, fold the paper over itself just a bit.

@summary
fold the same side of paper over the meat.

@summary
flip the meat again, keeping the paper going lengthwise with the meat very tight.

@summary
do the same thing with the paper on the other side of the meat as you did with the first side.

@summary
flip the meat towards the far end of the paper until the paper's nearly all used.

@summary
tape the package.

@summary
label the package with its contents!

 This method is a little more complex than the previous method and may take some practice to perfect.
 It doesn't have to be that corner, but if you're right-handed having it there will usually make it easiest.


If you're doing steaks (or similar cuts of meat), remember how many pieces are in each package. This'll come into play later on when you're labeling the package for freezing.
 The meat should lay perpendicular to the opposite corner of paper.
 This'll come in handy during the next step, so when you fold that same paper side over the meat, the corner will be nice and tight.



Try to keep the fold very tight against the side of the meat.
 Flip the meat towards the far end of the paper as you did the first time.
 Start by folding the edge of the paper a little over itself, then fold the entirety of that side of paper over the meat.


If the corner of the side of paper sticks out beyond the meat, you can either fold it back upon itself, or tuck the tail into the crease of the first side you folded over.
 Keep the meat inside the paper very tightly as you do this. It takes practice, but you'll improve with time.
 Usually two 2" pieces of freezer tape will suffice.
 You'll want to include the type of meat (beef, chicken, etc.), the cut of meat, and the date. If you're doing steaks (or similar cuts of meat), include how many steaks are in each package.


If you're freezing meat of several animals (such as several deer, or several cows), you may want to label each package for each animal. This way, if you find later that one of the animals has really bad meat, you don't have to dispose of all the frozen meat. One way to label the meat for this would be to label it as 'Cow #1, Cow #2', etc.
