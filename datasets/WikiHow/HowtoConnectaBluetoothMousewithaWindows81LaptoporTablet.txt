 The Bluetooth mouse should come with a manual and some alkaline batteries to assist you with the installation process. Purchase the batteries if your Bluetooth mouse did not come equipped with batteries.


Alkaline batteries will give the longest lifespan for your Bluetooth mouse.;
, This will enable the mouse to work.
 Do so by touching the power button on the computer.
 Connecting to the Internet will allow your operating system to locate the proper drivers for the device, if needed. Either plug an Ethernet cable into your laptop/computer, or go to the wireless preference settings and connect to a Wi-Fi network.
 The power button is usually found underneath the device. When the mouse is powered on, your operating system will not instantly recognize it.
,


After clicking on the Bluetooth option, your Windows 8.1 operating system will display the device after a brief period.
After being detected, the laptop or tablet will display a notification detailing that the mouse is ready to pair.
 During the pairing process, there are two things that can happen:


If the Windows 8.1 operating system has the drivers for your Bluetooth mouse, then these drivers will be installed automatically.
If the drivers are not available, the operating system will access the Internet to download them.
After the process has been completed and the drivers have been installed successfully, Windows 8.1 will display the product name of your Bluetooth mouse, indicating that the mouse has been connected.
 When you no longer need to use the Bluetooth mouse, just switch off the power using the power switch underneath the device.


Switching off the mouse when not in use will help conserve its batteries.
