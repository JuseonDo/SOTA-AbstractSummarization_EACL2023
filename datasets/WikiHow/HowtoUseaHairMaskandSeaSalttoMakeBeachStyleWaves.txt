,, Use only sea salt, not table salt. Add one to two teaspoons of salt to a spray bottle filled with water. Shake to combine.


A little sunscreen can be added the the salt spray if wished. This is optional.
 Dampen your hair. Then spread the mask through your hair.
 Watch a video, text a friend or read a book while waiting.
 Even with a hair mask, you should use conditioner as well.


Wash the mask out well by scrubbing gently under running water.
 When you get out of the shower spray your hair well with sea salt and water from a spray bottle.
 Leave in until the next morning. It must be a French braid because this is strong enough to produce the beach type waves.
 Enjoy your waves.
