 Teddys who have been stuck on a shelf in a store or are fresh from a huge toy factory or even abandoned in a charity or good will store, will need to know you, as their new owner, can be trusted. Explain to your Teddy you will never ever hurt them, you will always love them and that they will be loved and cared for in their new home.;
, All bears are called Teddy, some bears have a special name like Steiff Bears who have names like Elmar, Fynn and Lotte, Russ bears who are called things like Geoffrey or Timber and Gund bears who have names like Philbin. You can use the name of your bear that the company who made it gave it, or make up a new name or nickname for your bear. Any bear will be proud to have the same surname as you, if you want to give him or her a surname too.
 Introducing teddy to everyone at the same but might be a bit overwhelming, so if you have a lot of other plush toys, soft toys, dolls etc, don't introduce everyone immediately. If it's late when you get your new Teddy home, you could just tuck him into bed and do all the introductions the next day.
 Let them see life with you will be one long play time. Build a fort, play schools, have a tea party, go out doors, do anything you like with your bed that is fun.
 Teddy will enjoy sitting quietly next to you, or on your lap, to watch a movie. A family movie with a happy ending might be better than a scary film for Teddy's first night, but it's up to you. Teddy might like to know you trust him to protect you from scary movie monsters on his very first night, this couple be a real confidence booster.
 Make your Teddy bear your best friend and help him get along with all the rest of your toys and family.
