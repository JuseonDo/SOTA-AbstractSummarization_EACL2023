 A corner of a room, a nice yard, wherever you might want to be shooting the portraits.;
, You don't have to have expensive equipment to get a professional level shot.
 Get them comfortable with you and you comfortable with them. If someone is stiff and uncomfortable, it shows.
 Be able to reflect their personality with the photograph. You might have to surprise them with a photograph to do that, so be prepared.
 Try natural lighting or strobes and reflectors.
 A hair light is a supplemental light that you use to give the hair texture with light shot from behind the subject.This can make a huge difference in the shot.
 You want it to add to the image and not distract from the subject matter. Don't try for a solid white background because you will have some very severe blowout in the photo. If you do have something other than a plain background, like shooting outside, be sure that it complements your subject.
 Running around getting things at the last minute will break the continuity of what you are doing, cause your subject to be impatient, and can, very possibly, ruin the photoshoot.
