 Clean the glass as you normally would, such as by glass cleaner or a dampened microfiber cloth. Make sure all debris is removed from the glass surface, then allow the glass to dry., Only use a bottle of clear nail polish for scratch treatment. Dip the applicator that comes with the bottle into the nail polish. Youâ€™ll have a small coating of polish to apply to the scratch.
 Rub the applicator over the scratch. Minimize contact with the surrounding glass as much as possible. When the polish comes off the brush, it will go down into the scratch and remove visible flaws., Leave the polish alone so it has a chance to seep down into the scratch. Come back in an hour prepared to remove the polish.
 Tip a bottle of nail polish remover gently against a clean cloth until you have a small spot of polish on the cloth. You only need enough to counteract the polish., Using the cloth, spread the polish remover over the scratch. Once you are sure all the nail polish is removed, you can admire your freshened glass.
