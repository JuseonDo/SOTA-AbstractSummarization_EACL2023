 If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it. For dusty or lightly soiled fabrics that cannot be washed, use a vacuum or a brush. For heavily soiled fabrics that cannot be washed, use a specially-formulated fabric cleaner.
 You want the container to be large enough so that you can submerge all of your fabric in the detergent mixture.
 If parts of the fabric keep floating to the top, you can weigh them down with a glass jar or bottle., Do not fold it over a hanger, or the two sides will stick to each other. Instead, clip the top of the fabric piece to a hanger. If the fabric is too big for a hanger, then stretch a long piece of string between two poles or trees, and clip the fabric to that. You want the fabric to hang freely, in a single layer.
 Stir the solution to help the alum powder dissolve. You can buy alum powder at a grocery store., If it floats to the top, then weigh it down with a glass jar or bottle.
 Once again, make sure that the fabric is hanging freely. Clip it to a hanger, or to a piece of string.
