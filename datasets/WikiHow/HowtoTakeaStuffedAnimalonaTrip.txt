 Pick a stuffed animal that you are willing to spend your time with, not to just bring it for no reason, or use it as a pillow.
 This might be a bag, a suitcase, a school bag or a beach bag. Choose any bag that is small, light and strong. Ask your parents if the bag size is okay for the trip, as there will probably be many other things to take too.;
, Pick some pajamas, everyday clothes, party dresses, swimsuits, etc.
 Pick accessories that match your stuffed animal's clothes.
 Choose some shoes that fits with the clothes.
 You can choose anything in this step, such as blankets and pillows (big enough for your stuffed animal).,, Does it need a clean, perhaps a spot clean or a whole wash and dry? Are its arms, legs and eyes all stitched on well or is some mending needed? Fix anything before the trip, to ensure that your stuffed animal is in good shape when you actually travel., Take the stuffed animal on short car rides to get him/her used to being out of the house and tell him/her about all the fun stuff they are going to do on the trip.
,,, If you are stopping at a restaurant or gift shop, then let them have a bit of your meal so that they aren't hungry. You could also buy them a small gift to reward them for being good during the long car trip (if they are good).
 If they are bored, let them play with the toys and games you packed.
