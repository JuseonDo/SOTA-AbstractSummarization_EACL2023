double consonants are actually pronounced twice in italian.

@summary
silent consonant is the letter 'h' which has no role in pronunciation, but as a hint.

 For example,


capello (using what we learned /ka-pel-lo/) means hair.
cappello (using what we learned /kap-pεl-lo/) means hat.
 For example,


h comes between c and e as che to keep it a hard c. Otherwise c would be pronounced as t∫.
h also shows history of a word as a help to the speakers of the language. For example, ho (I have) pronounced as o is from the root avere (to have) pronounced as a-ve-re. Think of it that it actually has been (h)avere very near to English "have."
