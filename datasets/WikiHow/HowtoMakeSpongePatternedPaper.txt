 The colors should be complementary, using two alternative colors for each piece of paper you are using. One color must be considerably lighter than the first color.;
, Add a dash of water to weaken the color slightly.
, Squeeze out any excess water; it should be damp, not soaking.
 Press the sponge gently on the kitchen paper towel. This removes the heavier layer of paint.
 Start from one corner of the paper and press lightly in several spots.
,, The sheet of paper may even be interesting enough for you to stop here; that's completely up to you.
, Dilute slightly, then add to its own dish or tray.
 Overprint the paper by dabbing as before. However, this time be sparing in how and where you dab, and don't overdo the printing or you'll spoil the effect.
 When it is absolutely dry, it can be used to wrap your gifts.
