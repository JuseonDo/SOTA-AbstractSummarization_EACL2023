 You can always try to convince your parents, but maybe they divorced for a good reason; try finding out the reason why.
 You've heard this probably many times, but it's important. Yes, it helps to talk to someone, or to tell them both privately that you don't like them fighting. Try to get them to make up.
 Identify the types of abuse and take action against them. Here they are:


Physical abuse. Physical abuse is usually hitting, punching, kicking or really just anything that involves beating up.
Sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is usually rape, meaning unwanted sex or molesting, meaning touching someone.
Verbal abuse. Verbal abuse is with words, like really harsh words, not light words, but usually you will be called rude words, or sometimes it's threats. 
Neglect. Neglect is pretty common, but it means being uncared for, so if your parents aren't feeding you or caring for you, then it's neglect, and it's pretty serious.
