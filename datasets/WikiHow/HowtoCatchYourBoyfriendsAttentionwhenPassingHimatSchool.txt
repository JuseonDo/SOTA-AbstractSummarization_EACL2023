where do you usually pass each other in a hallway?,

@summary
be sure to make eye contact so he knows you are talking to him.

@summary
,

@summary
use his name.

@summary
write a note during your class and drop it on top of his books.

@summary
talk about something that just happened in class.

@summary
remember: if you feel awkward being around him, consider your relationship.

@summary
if you are in the same class as him try to sit next to him, then make a joke about something in the room, the posters, the students, or the teacher.

 Is it during the bustling time when people are pushing each other around or starting a mosh pit? Make sure your timing is good so that chances are he will hear you.;
,, Instead of saying "Hey!" which could be meant for anyone in the hall at the moment, say "Hey Ryan!" (or whatever his name is)

, Passing notes in the hall can't get you a detention and it shows him that you are interested in talking to him. In the note, write him your new number, a place to meet after school, or just tell him you are so happy to be with him.
 You may just want to say hi, but he may think you want to strike up a conversation (albeit a very short one).
 Do you guys talk enough? Do you go on dates? Give your relationship sometime but if these feelings continue, it may mean that you should think about breaking up. A relationship is about two people who feel a great bond between each other that is more than "buddies". In some cases this may get confusing but "just friends" may be better than dating.
 He will probably laugh, and chances are that he will make an even funnier joke as a response. Soon you'll be having one of the best ever conversations with your bf.
