@article
 You will need to set up the jump A) Along the fence. Or B) In the middle. However if you have an outdoor arena make sure your jump is smaller than the arena fence. If it is bigger, the horse might get confused and jump out of the arena!;
, The blocks mean your horse has a better chance of jumping the fence straight.
 This pole is used both as a guide and warm up jump. You can place wings on either side of your jump, but make sure any wings you use do not have cups attached. (These are a safety hazard)

, Your horse should be groomed, as if you are going to ride, but should not be tacked up. You can either exercise your horse in a headcollar or an in-hand bridle (A bridle with the reins taken off)

, Lunging the horse allows you to warm them up safely as when you remove the lunge line your control is limited.
 Take your horse/pony by the halter/bridle up to the pole. A few feet away let go of your horse/pony. Urge your pony over the pole with hands, voice and only if needed a whip. You may want to lead them over first, if your horse is young or nervous.
 Remember to start with a cross pole and gradually work upward.
,,, This is done completely off body language.
