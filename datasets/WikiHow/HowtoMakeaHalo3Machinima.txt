 They cost from 70-100 dollars. Video capture cards usually have Red White Yellow and S-Video, and have a USB cord coming out the other end.;
, Do some research before you buy.
 The high-standard Halo 3 Machinima directors need the same knowledge as someone shooting a live-action movie. Make use of over-the-shoulder, close up camera angles, etc.
 Is it going to be a lengthy movie or a series of short films? Is it a comedy, parody, or instructional movie? The point is, think of a script and write it down. Be original. No one likes copycats.
 Act everything out. Halo 3 Theater mode doesn't record voice, so just record multiple takes of everything, you can sync it later.
, Dazzle comes with a video capture program. Record all your saved clips from theater. You may want to get Red/White/Yellow splitters so you can view it on your TV and computer, because the dazzle screen is tiny and lags a little bit.
 Make sure there is no interference or background noise.
 Make sure you're familiar with your editing software, and watch it come together.
 Many Machinima directors upload their work to YouTube or Machinima.com.
