 Soft and medium tofu has more of a flavor, and you do not want to taste it.;
, It should be mostly smooth but still a little chunky.
, Present it as a new dessert. Act confident, taste it in front of the kids and enjoy it! They will likely follow suit.
 Soft tofu loses its taste when cooked.
 The tofu will be added to this recipe in place of some of the fat.


Cookies may turn out a little weird with this method, but will still work.
 This will reduce the fat greatly and sneak tofu into your kid's dessert.



Do not use firm or even medium tofu in a recipe. Your recipe will turn out with strange white chunks floating around in it and won't look or taste good.
 The soft tofu will disintegrate into the recipe and be disguised.
 And know that your kids are eating tofu and being healthy, without even knowing it!

, When your child has been weaned, start introducing them to new foods. Make tofu one of them!

Most meat recipes can be transferred to tofu. Fish and beef recipes usually work the best.
