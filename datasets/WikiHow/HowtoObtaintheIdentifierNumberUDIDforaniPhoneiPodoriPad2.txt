 If you don't see the Go menu in the menu bar, click the desktop first.
 You'll see additional menu options appear.
 This only appears if you are holding ⌥ Opt.
,,, iTunes labels your device backups with the device's UDID. The first backup of the device will have just the UDID as the folder name, while subsequent backups will have the UDID followed by a date.


If you have backed up multiple devices, click the "List View" button and use the "Date Modified" column to help determine which device the folder belongs to.
 If you have a single-button mouse, hold Ctrl and click the folder.


Right-click the first backup folder without the date at the end.
 This will allow you to paste it anywhere. Make sure not to rename the folder after copying the UDID, or the backup may not restore properly.
