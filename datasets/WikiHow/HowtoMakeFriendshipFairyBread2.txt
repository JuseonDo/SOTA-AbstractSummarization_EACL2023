 You could keep the bread as it is, in squares, but for a more impressive looking snack, slice the bread into triangles. Set aside.
 To the side, have your butter, jam and 100s and 1000s ready as well. Don't forget to include two knives - one for the butter and one for the jam.
 Take one slice of bread, and spread either butter or jam on the top. Then, spread a bit of jam onto the plate; it will help to stick the first slice of bread. 'Glue' your first triangle of bread onto the spot where you smeared on the jam.


To make your snack more impressive (as mentioned earlier), smear the jam in two areas. This way, you will have two triangular stacks that when pressed together, form a square.
 Repeat with every slice of bread - spread some jam onto a slice and stick it on. Spread some butter on a slice and stick it on. Continue this, remembering not to put any 100s and 1000s just yet, until there is one last piece of bread for each stack (you will have two pieces of bread).
 Stick them on, and sprinkle on the 100s and 1000s. Now, your two triangular fairy bread stacks should form a square. Go ahead and press them together to form a square, if you haven't already.
 Do not coat thickly - only a small amount will do. Pour a handful of 100s and 1000s into your hand and press onto the sides of the stack, coating it with a 100s and 1000s shell.
 Then, stand back and enjoy your marvelous creation!
