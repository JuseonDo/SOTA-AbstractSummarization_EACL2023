 Create the presentation that you want to embed on your Blogger account. Save it to an easily accessible location, such as "My Desktop" or "My Documents.";
, Find the "Sign Up" button in the upper right hand corner. You will need an email address, username and password.


A Scribd account allows you to make friends and host or publish documents online. The Scribd account will host your PowerPoint presentation. You can also sign up for a Scribd account through a Facebook account.
 Click on the "Upload" button at the top of the page. Choose to upload a single file, instead of a group of files.
 Click "Upload" in order to save the presentation to your Scribd account.


Type in your email address, when you see the screen that says "Wait! Your document isn't published yet." The email address is required for legal reasons. Click "Send" to publish your document.
Type in a description of your PowerPoint at the bottom of the Publishing page, if you want to. This is not required, but you can create tags and categories, if you want to share it on Scribd.
 Find the "Embed Code" near the bottom of the page. Uncheck the box that says to include a link to the file at the top of the code and press the "Copy" button to copy the code.


There are 2 elements to this code. The first "Object" tag tells an independent webpage how to post a presentation. The second "Embed" tag tells how the presentation should be embedded in another program, such as Blogger.
 Sign into your Blogger account.
 Type the title of your PowerPoint post.
 If you are using an Apple computer, press the "Command" and "V" keys to paste the code. If you are using a PC, press the "Control" and "V" keys to paste the code.


You should now only have the "Embed" element. It should begin and end with angular brackets around the word "embed."

, Return to your Blogger site to the PowerPoint posted to your homepage.
