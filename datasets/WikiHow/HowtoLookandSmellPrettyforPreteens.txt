 You want your teeth to smell fresh and look white! Floss and use mouth wash if needed.;
, Apply some light colored, shiny lip gloss to your lips.
 It will moisturize them and they will smell nice. Don't use a strong scent.
 A nice flowery scent is good. Or you could try layering scents with the lotion to make the scent stronger.
 Anything with flowers or hearts looks nice. You could try wearing are skirt that is not too short. Maybe about knee length. Or a dress could look good too. A cute top good work too. Do not wear high heels. Some sparkly flats would look nice.
 Make sure your teeth look nice and clean. Read step #1. Smiling makes you look nice!

, Walk with your head held high and your back straight! You will look confident.
 Some bracelets, a necklace, and a ring, and some earrings should be okay.
 If you need to, wash it with a nice smelling shampoo. Wash your hair with warm water and rinse with cold water to make it look shiny! When your hair is dry, curl it with a curling iron! Some pretty curls are always nice! Put on a hairband to push your hair back.
