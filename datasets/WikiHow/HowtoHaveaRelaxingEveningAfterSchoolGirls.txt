 It doesn't technically have to be your pajamas right away, just any loungewear or regular clothing that you feel comfortable in.;
, This way, you will get it done and over with and it won't be on your mind at all for the rest of the evening when you're supposed to be relaxing.
 Whether it be clean your room, or sign a birthday card for your Aunt, this way, it'll be out of the way as well.
 What better way to relax then doing something that you enjoy doing most?

, Even if your parents are cooking and you absolutely dislike what is being served, make sure that you still eat anyway, to prevent you getting extremely hungry before you go to bed.
 Once the bathtub is filled, get in there, sit, and just simply relax. Feel free to close your eyes, or do whatever you want to help you relax in the best way possible.
 Even if you were wearing pajamas earlier, it is still a good idea to pick out a new pair, so that way you have fresh ones on.
 Whether it's simply take a shower, brush your teeth, and hop into bed, or you watch tv or read, do that now.


If it's still early, then do the favorite activity that you were doing before dinner until you need to go to bed.
 Getting at least 8-10 hours of sleep will help you wake up, feeling nice and refreshed when morning rolls around once again.
