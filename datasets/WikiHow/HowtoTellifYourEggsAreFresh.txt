 Check the eggs by opening the carton. If some are broken, do not buy the carton.;
, Store them in the grocery carton in the coldest part of the refrigerator and not in the door.
 Break them into a clean container, cover tightly, and keep refrigerated for use within 2 days.
 Hard-cooked eggs will keep refrigerated for 1 week. Use leftover yolks and whites within 4 days. Don't keep eggs, including Easter eggs out of the refrigerator more than 2 hours.
 Heat the egg-milk mixture gently. Use a food thermometer to check the temperature or use a metal spoon (the mixture should coat the spoon). If in-shell pasteurized eggs are available, they can be used safely in recipes that won’t be cooked.
 AA eggs have a higher quality and longer shelf life. Make sure they've been refrigerated in the store. Any bacteria present in an egg can multiply quickly at room temperature.
 Use within 3 to 4 days. Cook egg dishes such as quiche and casseroles to 160 °F (71 °C) as measured with a food thermometer.
 If the egg sinks to the bottom and lays down, it is fresh. If it sinks and stands up on the bottom of the pan, it is not very fresh, but still safe to eat. If the egg floats on the surface, it should be thrown out.
