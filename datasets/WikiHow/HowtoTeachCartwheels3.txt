 Make sure it is long enough for the person to cartwheel across it.You can also use a carpeted area, as long as there are no breakable objects or obstacles around.
 Place it on the mat or carpet so it forms a straight vertical line.
 Make sure her leading foot is in front and her other foot is in line behind her in the lunge position.
 Her hands should be sideways, perpendicular to her body.
 Make sure she is placing weight into her hands as she rotates over. The line should help her stay straight as she cartwheels.
 Her leading foot should now be her back foot.
