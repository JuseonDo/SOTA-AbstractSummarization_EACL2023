 This works especially well for cast iron. The effervescence of the soda reacts with the iron, making the sides slick and difficult to stick to.
 Do not dump the soda out of the pot. Instead, submerge the sponge beneath the club soda and scrub the pot while the soda is still inside.
 Wipe out any remaining flakes of caramel with a dry paper towel.
