 Choose either bone-in or boneless pork chops. The boneless chops tend to have less fat, but they aren't quite as flavorful. Bone-in chops are less expensive and release a lot of delicious flavor as they cook.;
,, Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Add other seasonings like garlic powder or paprika if you'd like.
 Let the butter melt completely before proceeding. The pan should be nice and hot.
 Make sure none of them are overlapping. If you need to fry the pork chops two at a time because your pan isn't large enough for four, that's fine.
 If the pork chops are thicker than an inch, give them a bit longer.
