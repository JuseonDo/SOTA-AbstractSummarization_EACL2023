 Fold the easy items that are on display, such as towels and wash cloths. Put them in a small pile and keep them straight. This will make it look like you're organized. All of the other clothes can go inside baskets or boxes. Then put them into another room or out of sight. If you can't do this, place them in a straight line or stack.
 These will be the most obvious, and the rest can be ignored., Unplug and put away unused cords to give the impression of neatness., If you have time, wash the easy items first, such as plates, glasses, and silverware. Stacking dishes from the largest to smallest may make you appear more organized. You can also hide a fair few dishes inside the dishwasher.

Clean up any food you may have lying around.
 Make sure nothing is "peeping" or hanging out of your closets.

Put together papers that you can organize and file at a later date and tuck them away.
 It is better to do this than to give the impression of mess but do remember to unpack the junk boxes when the guests leave.
