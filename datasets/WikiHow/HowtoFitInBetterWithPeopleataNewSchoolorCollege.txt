 Be ready to face them. After all experience is the best teacher. And truly you will find new experiences teaching you a lot helping you in the future.;
, Adapt to your surroundings and each new change will help you deal different situations in different ways. "Fitting in" might seem a good option, but in the end we all want to make a place we are proud of. "Fitting in" may not only lead you to go on the wrong way but it will cause you to remain like a frog in a well.
 A simple "hello" or "hi" can create a difference instead of sitting all by yourself and mourning over having no one to talk to.
 Make sure you know what you want from your life not what others think life should be lived like.
 Because your gut feelings may give you the right sign in case you do something wrong. You can lie to others but not your conscience.
 Remember, Actions speak louder than words.
 Communication is key. If you don't talk to others they might end up not liking your company and start acting funny. And may even be rude and ignore you.
 You are unique. You don't need people to tell you what you are. You are special.
 Keep in touch with your besties too! You don't know when you'll be needing their love and advice. And their constant support!

, The more you mingle with people, the more you'll feel belonged and loved!

, Crying in the corner always won't help you. It's time you face your troubles and find solutions to it! In hard times, remember that after a gloomy day comes sunshine! So be positive and be happy!
