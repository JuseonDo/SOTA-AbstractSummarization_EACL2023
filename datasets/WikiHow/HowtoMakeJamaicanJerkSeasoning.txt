 You may use whole allspice berries, if available, but use enough to give the equivalent of half a cup ground. (Allspice berries and scotch bonnets are key ingredients.) Keep this sauce refrigerated and it will keep for just about forever.;
, If using a pork shoulder, score the fat and rub in. With chicken, be sure to rub under skin and in the cavities. This seasoning can also be used with fish, but use a firm-fleshed fish like tuna or salmon.
