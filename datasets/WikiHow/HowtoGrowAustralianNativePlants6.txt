 In paved areas water must be allowed to percolate downwards, therefore no mortared joints.,,, Three things you should be doing: reducing the amount of plants (native and introduced) with berries as this is a major source of food for them; stop artificial feeding; and plant dense and spiky shrubs to provide safe nesting and hiding spots for smaller birds which the Currawongs prey on.
 Mine are growing in very dry situations and only get a burst of mid day sun the rest of the day they receive dappled light. Talking to some “gardening industry” people the only maintenance appears to be lifting them every five years and dividing them up and starting again.
