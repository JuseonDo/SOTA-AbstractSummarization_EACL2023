 You are looking for something that looks like flour.For extra nutrients, add 1½ teaspoons (7.5 grams) of dried chia seeds. If you don't like chia seeds, consider a protein powder instead. You can use all sorts of varieties of protein powders, from hemp-based to brown rice.;
, Use a long-handled spoon or spatula to mix in some milk, juice, or a combination of the two. You can use any type of milk, including non-dairy milk, such as almond or soy. Great juice options include orange juice.


Be sure to scrape the bottom of your blender. This will help "lift" any oats or chia seeds that may have settled, and help your smoothie blend better., You can use plain yogurt, Greek, or even flavored yogurt. Plain, unflavored yogurt will give you the greatest control over the final flavor of the smoothie, however.
 You can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit; if the fruit is frozen, however, you might want to thaw it first. Small fruits, such as berries, can go right into the blender and don't need to be cut. Larger fruits, such as strawberries or bananas, should be sliced.


Fruits that work well in smoothies include: bananas, berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries), peaches, and mangos.
Remember to cut off any stems, and to cut out any seeds or pits.
 At this point, your smoothie is almost ready. You can enhance it further, however, by adding in some optional ingredients, such as cooking spices or sweeteners. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Spices and flavors, such as cocoa powder, ground cinnamon, or vanilla extract.
Add-ins, such as shredded coconut, chopped nuts, jams, or preserves.
Sweeteners, such as chocolate syrup, honey, maple syrup, or agrave nectar

, From time to time, you may want to open up the blender, and use a spatula to push the smoothie down the walls of the blender. This will help the ingredients mix in more evenly.
 If the smoothie is too thick, add some more of your liquid ingredient; if it is too thin, add some more ice or yogurt. If the smoothie is too sweet, you can add some more yogurt or oatmeal; if it is not sweet enough, simply add more of your sweetener. Be sure to blend your smoothie one more time if you do add anything to it.
 You can serve the smoothie as is, or let them chill for 4 to 8 hours. This will give the oats enough time to soak up the liquids and expand, resulting in a thicker, creamier smoothie.,
