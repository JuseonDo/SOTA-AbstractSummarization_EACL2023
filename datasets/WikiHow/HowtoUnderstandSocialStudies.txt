 When you do your homework while the things that are taught are fresh in your mind, it stays there longer, its like a revision.;
, It feels really good when you fully pay attention in a class. You understand the concepts and later on when you study you don't have to waste time on learning and understanding the topics instead you will be revising, going through the chapters. And this means great scores.
 The more you participate, the more you understand and remember. This also prevents you from getting bored and it keeps drowsiness away. And it also helps in impressing your teacher.(Since, it shows what you know)

, You teacher will always be ready to help you. If you think your teacher is strict and you aren't brave enough to approach her, then ask your friends or your siblings or anyone who you think is capable of helping.
 You will know what your mistakes are and you will be able to work on them.
 Just go through these before the exams or else you will have to study from the textbook which is time consuming as well as boring.
 An important question or an important topic.
 Also watch news, as this subject is about society (mainly). It'll help you in writing good answers.
 Learn social science slowly from the very beginning and revise it once a week. This will reduce your burden.
