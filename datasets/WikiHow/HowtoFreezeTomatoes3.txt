 Place the cookie sheet in the freezer. Placing the tomatoes on cookie sheets will preserve their shapes. Whole tomatoes donâ€™t need to be blanched before cooking., Place them into plastic bags with seals. Make sure that all of the air is squeezed out of the bags.
 When they have been run under warm water for a minute or so, their skins should loosen and slip off easily.
