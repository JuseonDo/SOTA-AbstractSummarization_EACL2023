@summary
get behind your opponent and bring him to the ground.

@summary
wrap your legs around him, to where your insteps are roughly on the inside of his thighs or knees (this is commonly known as "getting your hooks in", the legs/feet being the hooks).

@summary
releasing the seat belt, loop one arm around your opponent's neck: this will typically be the top-most arm in the seat-belt position, just for convenience, but it doesn't really matter.

@summary
using your main-hand, grab the bicep of the other arm.

@summary
making sure to keep the figure-four grip intact, place your unoccupied off-hand against the back of your opponent's neck, to where it's roughly aligned with the arm that's looped around his neck.

@summary

 The rear naked choke, as the name implies, requires that you are behind your opponent. While the hold can be performed from the standing position, it is advisable to bring your opponent to the ground for maximum control.;
, Simultaneously, reach one arm over his neck and toward the center of his chest, while reaching your other arm in from under his arm. Clasp your hands together in a tight grip over his chest. This is commonly known as the seat belt, and will ensure that you stay on your opponent's back even if he starts trying to buck you off.
 Try to get your elbow aligned with his chin, so that his throat is basically caught in the crook of your elbow. For clarity, the arm looped around your opponent's neck will henceforth be referred to as your "main-hand", whereas your unoccupied arm is your "off-hand".
 Usually, this will result in your hand gripping the crook of your elbow, which is perfectly fine, as long as you maintain the grip. The grip is often called a "figure-four", due to the way your arms form the number four when performing it, and this can serve as a guide-line if you're unsure how you should be gripping.
 For reasons that will be discussed below, it is advisable that you make a fist with this hand, as it will not be grabbing anything for the remainder of the hold.
 More specifically, flex the choking arm as much as you can muster, while pushing your off-hand into his neck from behind. If done right, this will cut off the blood flow to his brain, resulting in unconsciousness in approximately five seconds. To reiterate, this move is NOT supposed to put pressure on your opponent's throat or trachea.
