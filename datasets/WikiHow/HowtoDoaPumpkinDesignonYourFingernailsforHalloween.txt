 Paint each fingernail a different color. Here's the order: Orange (thumb) Black (pointer finger) orange (middle finger) black (ring finger) orange (pinky) on both hands.;
, Choose a black nail pen from your nearest store. Regular black nail polish could work, but it will be harder. A black nail art pen has a sharper point, so it's easier.
 Start with your orange thumb. Draw two triangles at the top and shade them in.
 Do a squiggle line or any pumpkin mouth. Shade it in.
 For these, just do a French tip. (go here to learn how to do a French tip: https://www.wikihow.com/Give-Yourself-a-French-Manicure ).
 Paint the nails the same way with your other hand.
 Go over them with the pen one more time and a clear nail polish (you can find these at your nearest store as well).
