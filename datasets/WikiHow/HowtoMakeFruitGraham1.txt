 Keep mixing them until they are evenly combined. There should be no streaks or swirls of condensed milk visible.


The all-purpose cream must be chilled so that it is thick. If it is too warm, it will be too oozy and not allow the fruit cocktail to "float.";
, The entire bottom of the pan should be covered. Save the remaining graham crackers for further layers.
 Take a graham cracker, and crumble it until it resembles a coarse grain—sort of like sand or coffee grounds. Use this to fill in any cracks between the larger graham crackers., The cream should be thick, sort of like custard or pudding. If it is too thin and oozy, put it into the fridge for about 15 minutes.
 If you are using a clear pan, be sure to push some of the fruits right up against the sides. This will give you a nicer look and presentation.
 Remember to fill in the spaces between the graham crackers with more crushed graham crackers. If you still have lots of ingredients left over, you can repeat the layers in your pan until you have none left. You can also fill up a second pan.
 A popular garnish is to crush graham crackers into a fine crumble (like coarse sand or coffee grounds), and them spread them across the top of the cake in a grid-like fashion. Each "grid" equals on serving, and gets topped with a piece of fruit cocktail.,, Slice the fruit graham with a sharp knife, and serve it with a spatula. Immediately refrigerate any leftovers.
