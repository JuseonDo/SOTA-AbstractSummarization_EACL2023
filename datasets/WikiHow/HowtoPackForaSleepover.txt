 Take a sleeping bag and pillow if you aren't going to have an available bed to sleep in. If you don't have a sleeping bag, you can just use pillows and blankets. And make sure to bring all of the necessities, like your toothbrush, PJ's, hairbrush and any other personal items you know you'll need.;
, Make sure to not just ask about you, but also ask if they need anything, like snacks, party favors or something .
 Bring a medium-sized (not huge) bag that can hold everything you'll need. Don't cram your stuff into a small bag, as it will likely spill out. An overnight bag or tote bag is perfect for a sleepover. You could also bring a small purse or makeup bag for the small stuff, such as makeup.
 This will help you remember the things you need. You can add check boxes to check off the stuff to keep it all organized. Tape it to the inside of one of your bags, a little journal or on the fridge.
 If you are bringing them make sure they are in a safe place.)
