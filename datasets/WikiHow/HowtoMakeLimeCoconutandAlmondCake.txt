 Line the baking pan or grease it.;
, Put the yolks in one large mixing bowl and the whites in the other.
 Make sure the lime has been well washed first.
 Stir evenly with a fork.
 If using an electric beater, use the medium setting. If doing by hand, whisk methodically. Turn the electric beater to high (or whisk faster by hand) until the mixture doubles in volume. This will take about 3 minutes with the electric beater and about twice that time by hand.
, Beat the egg whites on high speed or quickly until stiff peaks form. Stir a third of this mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Once mixed in, gently stir in the remainder. Do not mix too much, mix only until the white streaks disappear.
,, Squeeze two tablespoons (30ml) of lime juice from the limes into a bowl. Add the icing sugar and the remaining grated lime peel. Mix to form icing.
 Run a knife tip around the edge of the cake to separate from the pan and release the hinge of the pan.
 It is fine to let it run down the sides of the cake; this adds to the effect.
