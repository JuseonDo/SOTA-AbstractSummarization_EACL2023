 Place the blade of the shovel from 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2Â cm) from the show with the back of the shovel toward the surf. The handle of your shovel should be pointing landward.;
, Position your body weight over the shovel and push straight down while dropping to one knee. While keeping the blade as vertical as possible gently rock the shovel from side to side to make it easier to push into the hard sand. It is very important to keep the shovel as vertical as possible to avoid breaking the clam.
 Cracks will appear in the sand.
 Pulling the sand out of the hole, be very careful to avoid breaking the clam.
 Reaching into the hole you made with your hand, you should feel the clam. You may need to scoop out a little more sand by hand. Retrieve your razor clam.
