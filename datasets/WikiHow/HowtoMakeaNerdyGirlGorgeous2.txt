if you`re on a larger budget- go to a make-up counter (mac, clinique, chanel, lancome, est√©e lauder, etc.),

if you`re on a lower budget - get a cousin, parent, or friend who's good at make-up to go with you to the drugstore and pick out some good make-up for you.

 and have them do your make-up and suggest products for you., They can also help to show you the techniques. Some good drugstore brands are L'Oreal, Prestige, Almay, and Revlon. Be cautious with lower-quality brands such as Cover Girl, N.Y.C, and Maybelline; although the prices may be somewhat lower, the ingredients are often inferior, and can result in a less-natural look.
