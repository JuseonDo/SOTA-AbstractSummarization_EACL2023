 You can use black wool for a bridle with white circles for the bit. Get a piece of coloured material in the shape of a square for a saddle cloth. You can use a piece of circular black material for a saddle, with a strip of the same material for the girth. Also use wool for a halter and lead rope.Use yarn to make a harness for your horse so you can have her/him pull a sled.
 Rip up bits of yellow, brown, white and pale brown/yellow paper for a coarse mix. You can make containers of different 'feed' types, aka colours. If you want, you can label the containers.
 Make a wheelbarrow with some cardboard and an old milk carton lid for a wheel. Make a pitchfork and shovel by getting a long strip of cardboard and attach a square of cardboard on one end for a spade and four short strips for a pitchfork. Do the same thing for the broom except use wool for hairs.
 For jumps use strips of cardboard against a base on either side. For dressage markers stick masking tape on pieces of cardboard around the arena with the appropriate letters marked on each one.
, to make a brush, cut out an oval of cardboard and glue short strips of wool underneath it. For sponges you can use cotton balls or cut up an old sponge. Make a hoof pick by getting a strip of cardboard with a curved tip that is painted silver or covered with aluminum foil. Find a small bag to put all your grooming supplies in.
 Curl the rectangle into a cylinder shape and glue/tape/staple the two ends together. Attach the circle to the bottom and you have a bucket!

, Measure your horse's body and make rugs suitable. You can also make neck rugs and hoods. Use Velcro, buttons, clips or buckles to fasten.
