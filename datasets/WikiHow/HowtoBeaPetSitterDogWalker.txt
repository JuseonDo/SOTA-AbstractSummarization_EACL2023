@summary
first of all, think of a name for your pet sitting/dog walking business.

@summary
decide how much you're going to charge for what service.

@summary
put yourself out there to the world!,

@summary
once you've made up your posters, put them around in as many places as possible.

@summary
if you want to attract even more business, make business cards and hand them out to friends/family/neighbors.

@summary
once you get your first customer, be friendly to them and do a good job with their pets.

@summary
after doing all of these steps, your pet sitting/dog walking business should really get off of the ground!
@article
 If you're making an amateur business, something like "Sarah's Dog Walking" would suffice, but if you actually want to make this a small business and copyright the name, it will have to be more creative.;
, Will you charge for how long you walk/look after the dog? Will you charge more if the dog is badly behaved and you have to control it more? Think about these things. If you just want to walk/look after dogs for fun, you can offer your services for free!

, Nobody is going to know about you if you don't advertise. You need to make posters advertising your dog walking service. Your poster should have the following on it:


the name of your dog walking/pet sitting business
the services you provide
when you're available (weekdays, weekends, after school?)
how much you charge
means of contacting you (phone number and/or email address)
a little bit about you (are you a student? Do you have previous pet ownership experiences?)

, Tape them to streetlamps, post them at community centers, schools, and supermarket bulletin boards. If you don't attract the attention of other people, your business will never get off the ground!

, This will make you look very professional.
 Show them that you're a trustworthy person. People love their dogs, and if you do a good job of taking care of them, your customers will talk to their friends and recommend you to them. Word will get around and will earn you even more customers. All you have to do is be trustworthy, polite, and professional.
 You may have to be patient, but the results will eventually come, and you might end up making a fair bit of money! Good luck!
