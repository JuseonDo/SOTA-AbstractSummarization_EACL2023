 Over the top of the fillets, spread the butter evenly using a butter knife. Then, sprinkle the fillets with the cinnamon and the basil.
 For a well done fillet, cook the salmon 10 minutes for every inch of thickness. If you like your fillet less well done, then simply shorten the cooking time.


Test your salmon for doneness by using a fork to see if the flesh flakes slightly.
