 Put on something you know you wouldn't normally wear. Ask your girlfriend over to your house. If she acts differently, then ask what's wrong. This works best on the weekends, in case your other friends might get the wrong message.;
, When you go to pay for the two of you, reach into your pocket and say you don't have any money. If she offers to pay for the two of you, then she's okay. Try doing something cheap like the movies, so you don't get into trouble.
 See her reaction when you two meet and you have nothing to give her.
 If you would normally give her an expensive gift, size down to a card from a gift shop. Say you didn't have enough money for a big gift, and this was the only way to show your true feelings.
 Be serious too. If she jokes around then she probably isn't serious about your relationship.
 Stay calm, but speak firmly. Don't blow up on her and just speak your mind. If she really likes you, she'll explain that you have just been acting not yourself and she worries about you.
