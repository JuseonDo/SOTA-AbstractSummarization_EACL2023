Use very sturdy cardboard for this tray.
You can also use several thick sheets of cardboard for a stronger base.
 Cover the portion of the bottle above the support with aluminum foil.
 You want the kind that sprays with a foam and hardens.

 Once your basic shape is formed, allow it to dry.
, Place a small piece of paper atop it.
 Drop 4 Mentos into the cylinder.
 Quickly remove the paper that is lying flat over the top of the soda bottle. The 4 Mentos should pour into the bottle starting the explosion. The porous surface of the Mentos causes the rapid formation of carbon dioxide. This chemical reaction produces foam. Remove your 2 l bottle of soda from the bottom of the cardboard. Insert another bottle and do it again.
