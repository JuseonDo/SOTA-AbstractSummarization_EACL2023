 Simply bend the bottom, sides, and top until you get a circle. It doesn't have to be perfect. Don't cut the hanger part off; you can use this later on to hang your finished wreath!If you can't find a wire coat hanger, you can also use a metal ring instead.;
, You will be using these to tie your candy to the coat hanger base. The measurements don't have to be exact, so you could even wrap the string several times around a DVD case, then cut it to create many short pieces of string.

You will be eventually trimming the string down. If you'd like a more decorative wreath, however, you could leave the string uncut. In this case, consider using curling ribbon instead.
 Try to get the string right between the twisted part of the wrapper and the candy itself. You only have to tie the string to one side of the candy, and you not need to create a double knot.Do this step for all of the candy that you have.

You can use any type of twist-wrapped candy, such as peppermints, Jolly Ranchers, taffy, and butterscotch.
 Take one of your tied candies, and use the tail ends of the string to tie it to the hanger. Tie the string in a tight, double knot.For a neater finish, snip the loose ends of the string off. For a more decorative finish, leave the string uncut; it will become part of the wreath's design., Gently push down on the candy as you tie it so that it squishes together and gives you a fuller wreath., Cut the tail ends of the bow at into angles or into V-shaped notches. The ribbon can be simple satin or velvet, or it could be one of those fancier ribbons with glitter or printed designs., If you'd like the hook to be less visible, you can paint it to match your wall or door. Ordinary acrylic paint will do, but enamel/model paint will also work. Nail polish will also do in a pinch.
