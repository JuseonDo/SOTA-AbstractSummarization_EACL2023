 This will make it easier to assemble the sandwich properly. Then place one slice of cheese on each slice of bread. Be sure that there is no cheese hanging over the side of the bread, or it will melt into a gooey mess.
 Close the door and push the button. Cook for about 1-3 minutes. Wait for the sound that signals the completion of the cooking stage.
 Carefully pick up one piece of bread and quickly put it on your plate. Repeat with the other piece of bread, but this time place it on top of the first piece with the cheesy side face down. The edges of the bread slices should match up. Press your sandwich together until you feel that the cheese has bonded the two pieces of bread together.Another good tip is to add some pepper to add a little flavor.
