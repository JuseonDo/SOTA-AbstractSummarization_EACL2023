 The type of peeps is entirely up to your preferences.;
,, Use tongs or wear disposable gloves to hold the peeps. You might find it helps to also use a spoon to spoon over melted chocolate, as well as the simple dip. This is helpful because the sugary texture of the peep can cause the chocolate to drip off in parts, so you'll need to keep spooning the chocolate back in place.



If you have a marble slab, the peeps can set on this; cover with wax paper first.
 Either sprinkle over or roll quickly in a saucer or wide bowl of sprinkles.
 An array of chicks or bunnies can look very cute when packaged in this way.
 If placing in an Easter basket, wrap in clear cellophane first, either individually or in a line.
 Use such items as chopped jelly beans, small pieces of shoestring licorice, carefully chopped M&Ms, etc. These items must be stuck on the peep while the chocolate is still wet; be aware that if the candy item is too heavy, it risks sliding down the face of the peep and making a mess.


Cake frosting or icing in a tube can be more effective and less heavy than adding candies if you want to decorate further.
For bunny peeps, the addition of just one thing can be very effective––namely, a tail. To make this, use small marshmallows cut in half. Stick onto the base of the back of the wet chocolate coated bunny and dry facing downward, with the tail sticking up. These are very cute.
