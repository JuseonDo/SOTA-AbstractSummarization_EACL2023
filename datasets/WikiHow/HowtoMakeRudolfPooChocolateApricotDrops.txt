 Crush with your fingers or a heavy utensil such as a meat mallet. You can use a plastic bag on a counter top if preferred; just place biscuits in the bag and crush using a rolling pin.;
, This is best done on a wooden cutting board. Wash hands to remove stickiness before proceeding.
 You can use either dark, milk, or white chocolate. Stir in the four dessert spoons of golden syrup.
, Put the balls on a baking tray or plate covered in baking paper. Place in the fridge to harden for about an hour.
 Serve and enjoy!
