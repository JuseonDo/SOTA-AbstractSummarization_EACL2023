 The skillet should be about 12 inches (30 1/2 centimeters) in diameter. Select a skillet with deep sides and heat the oil over medium-high heat. Turn the skillet to coat the entire bottom with the oil.
 Sauté  the garlic until it begins to brown. This should only take a minute or less. Do not allow the garlic to cook much longer, since it will burn if allowed to cook alone for too long.
 If necessary, pat it down into the pan using your hands or a spatula, but be careful to avoid burning yourself on the hot oil.
 Use tongs or two spatulas to lift and flip the spinach. Turn the spinach several times until you are certain that all the leaves are coated.
 Leave it covered and cook the spinach, without turning, for a full minute.
 Turn the spinach again with your tongs or spatulas to re-coat the leaves with oil.
 Cook it for 1 more minute.
 Drain the pan of any moisture.
 Turn the spinach with tongs or spatulas to coat it before serving.
