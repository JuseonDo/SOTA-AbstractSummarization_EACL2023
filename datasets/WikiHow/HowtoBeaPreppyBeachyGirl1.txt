 If you want to be a traditional prep, then you should buy things from Gap, US Polo Assn., Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Vineyard Vines, etc. Some of the clothes are a little pricey, but when you save up money for a month or two, you end up getting a lot of things. Remember, quality over quantity. Forever 21 and Wet Seal are budget friendly, and have cute preppy accessories like wooden necklaces and rustic things, and shell necklaces. Or, you can make your own shell necklaces. But, buy one pair of pearl earrings, one shell necklace, and bangles.;
, The colors should be either bright or pastel.
2-3 pairs of Different jeans (get one destroyed, at least 1 skinny leg and 1 boot leg)
Many simple T shirts with a logo or name of the the store (for stereotypical prep)
Flats (with a little bow are adorable)
Thongs (shoes) and sandals are a must!
Canvas shoes (like the ones from Rocket Dog or Toms and in tan and/or white)
Different colored tanks, in colors like white, grey, blue, yellow, red, orange, purple, green, and black.
Bermuda shorts in patterns like stripes, plaid, gingham, solid, or madras
Hoodies with college name(ideal would be an Ivy League university hoodie) name on it, without zipper. Also get some tracksuit jackets that have a zipper.
Some beachy clothes like board shorts and shirts to go with them in beachy colours- yellow, orange, blue, green, purple, pink, coral, white, red, etc.
