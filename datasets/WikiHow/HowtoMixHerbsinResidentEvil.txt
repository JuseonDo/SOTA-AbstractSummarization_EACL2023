,, Here is the color and description corresponding to your health in most games, and the heartbeat monitor goes higher up and down when you have more health;



Fine: Full or near full health.

Caution and then Caution when it gets worse: Character starts limping and moves slower.

Danger: Character starts limping even more, clutching their side and running even slower. Get a healing item as soon as possible. Do not save in this status or your game could be ruined if you can never get out of it.

Poison: Seek blue herbs. Character slowly loses health, and limps, even if they are otherwise fine. Green and Red herbs don't cure poison, only heal you.
