 Break apart and chop roughly., Line with waxed paper. Spread butter thinly across the top of the wax paper on each sheet., Either use a microwave or a double boiler to melt the coating., Repeat in even rows until all of the coating has been dropped onto the sheet in this way.

Use a level tablespoon of coating for each candy.
 This will be about 3 minutes. At this point, push in a few cashews, up to 7. Leave so that they continue to set, embedding the cashews within the candy coating., Add the caramels., Stir continuously until the caramels melt. Stir until the whole mixture is smooth., Gently ladle over the cashews.

If the caramel hardens too much while doing this, simply gently reheat to melt.
 Use the same method as before., This will sandwich the cashews and caramels in between two layers of chocolate candy coating., When fully set, the cashew chocolate caramels are ready to eat.
