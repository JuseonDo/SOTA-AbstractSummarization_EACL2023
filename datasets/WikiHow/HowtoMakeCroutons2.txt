 The best type of bread to use for this is something that is somewhat stale with a thick crust, such as: boule, ciabatta, and sourdough.], Try to use salted butter if you can. If you don't have any salted butter on hand, that is okay—just use unsalted butter, and plan to add a pinch of salt later on.
 You want the bread pieces to be in a single layer. If you have small skillet, it might be a better idea to do this in several batches, otherwise the croutons might end up soggy., If you are using unsalted butter, you can add a pinch of salt at this time.
 Avoid stirring the bread during this time. You only need the bottom side to turn brown. Once it turns brown (or a light-golden color, if you prefer), you are ready for the next step.
 Once the bread pieces start to turn brown, use a metal spatula to turn them over. Cook the bread pieces for another 10 minutes or so, or until they are browned to your liking., If they are too oily for your liking, you can let them drain on a few folded pieces of paper towel., This recipe makes about 3 cups (90 grams) of croutons, so you will likely have lots left over. You can store any leftover croutons in an airtight container, as long as they have cooled down first.
