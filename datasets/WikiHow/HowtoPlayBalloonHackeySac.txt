 Play in a room that isn't very large, and may have some stuff in it, like a small bedroom. This is best because there are obstacles to avoid, and the bed can be used for style points.;
, Each player starts on one side, and you choose who serves first.
 Keep passing the balloon back and forth until it hits the ground. The person whose side it lands on loses, and the other person gains 1 point.
 Switch every time the points add up to equal multiples of 5 (ex, 5-0, 3-5, 7-8, etc.)

, To do this, you must hit the balloon to the other side with great flair. You can only score that point if you win the round. Both players must agree that it was a style point.
