 You can usually shop around by phone for banks in your area that are willing to loan small amounts of money However, many banks do not offer small consumer loans at all. Shop for small consumer loans from credit unions or savings and loans institutions.


Ideally, you want an unsecured loan.That's a loan supported only by the borrower's creditworthiness. However, you might have trouble finding that type of loan for your child. Instead, you may have to offer up some collateral.
 The idea here is to just build a credit history. You want credit card companies to look at the credit report of your child and see that he or she has already paid back a loan.


This credit-building step should be restricted to children who are over the age of 18 since they are required to sign a contract.
 The creditor reports the payment history to the three credit bureaus, which shows up on your child's credit history.
