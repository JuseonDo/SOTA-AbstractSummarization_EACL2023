 We'll worry about writing and the introduction later on. Try to think of things that helped shape your view of the world and affected who you are as a person. Sort your list chronologically.;
, For each event that you wrote down, write about it as if you are writing only about that topic.
 After you have completed step 2 for every event, begin to tie the events together, explaining how they relate to one another and how they have influenced your life.
 After you have written the body of the work, go about writing the introduction. It is suggested that one takes a humble, yet not self defeating stance. Explain why your autobiography is of importance to the reader. Pull them in to the work.
 After writing your introduction and body, reread the work and sum everything up in the conclusion. Explain how this has brought you to where you are today, how these events have truly affected your present way of life for better and for worse.
 Go through your paper now and eliminate and redundancies, errors, and items that are not accurate. Check for spelling, grammar, and style errors as well.
 Remember to add important details, like who was there with you during an important event, but don't add in things that won't affect the story, like the color of the shirt you wore that day.
 Ask this of people who have known you for a while as well as newer acquaintances. This way you get an objective standpoint.
