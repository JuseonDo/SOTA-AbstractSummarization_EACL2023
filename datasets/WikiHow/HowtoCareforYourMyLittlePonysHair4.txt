wash the pony.

@summary
wrap the mane up in a hair curler, beginning at the end of the hair and spiraling up the curler as you go, so that the curl will coil downward.

@summary
use another curler (or marker cap) for the tail, and fix it in place as you did the mane.

leave your pony to dry overnight.

Â Brush your pony's hair while it's still a little damp.
 Snap the curler closed when you are finished. If you're using a marker cap instead of a curler, wrap a strip of paper towel around the hair and fix it in place with a pin.
, In the morning, you can take out the curlers or unpin the hair. Be careful to keep the curls intact as you remove the curlers or caps. If the curls seem a little stiff, just squeeze them lightly between your fingers. Don't worry if they seem a bit tight at first; they'll loosen within a few hours.
