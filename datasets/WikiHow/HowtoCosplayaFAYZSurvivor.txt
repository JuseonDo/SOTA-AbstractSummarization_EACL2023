 This is the most important part. The kids of the FAYZ eventually run out of options in their wardrobe.;
,, Again, try to find grungy ones. Preferably pants, since the FAYZ is known to be extremely cold at night.
 Kids in Perdido Beach tend to cling to old fashion trends or possessions. Wear pins, bracelets, sunglasses, gloves, etc.
 Wear old, mismatched shoes, like an old sneaker and a sandal.
 Keep it messy. Wear a hat, a totally random hat (examples: a top hat, a work hat, a beanie, etc.).
, The FAYZ is not a happy, loving place. Nearly everyone over the age of five carries a weapon. Carry a toy mace or a lightsaber. Nothing literally dangerous.
 Lots of kids wear random items they found. Things like too much makeup, a bandana, a cape, or a mask.
