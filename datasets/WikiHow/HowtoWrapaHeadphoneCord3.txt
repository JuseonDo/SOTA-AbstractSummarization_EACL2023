 To do a DIY holder, you'll need a small strip of Velcro and some glue.
 Aim for the area above the plug that is inserted into the phone.


Hot glue works well for this.
 Wait for 5-10 minutes so that the glue is dry and the Velcro sticks to the headphone well.
 Fold your headphones as per your wish and then wrap them using the Velcro strap.
 Ready to store.
