 Yes, you could pull off a hand held photograph, but it will never be as sharp as a tripod mounted shot will be., This makes the iris smaller and helps improve what will be a very limited depth of field. F16 or F22 are some good places to start., With the aperture setting closed down so far, you will need all the extra time you can get.
