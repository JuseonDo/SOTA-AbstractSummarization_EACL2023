 This damages the heart and causes the chest pain associated with a heart attack. The chest pain experienced during a heart attack can be described as dull, achy, squeezing, tight, or like a heavy pressure. It focuses around the center of the chest. To make sure you're having a heart attack, look for its other symptoms:


Shortness of breath
Nausea or vomiting
Light-headedness or dizziness
Cold sweats
Pain in the left arm, jaw, and neck.;
, The faster the doctors can clear the blockage, the less damage it can do to the heart.
 Even a small amount of aspirin will suppress the presence of platelets in your blood, thinning both blood and clots.


Studies show that chewing the aspirin tablet is more effective at treating the clot, easing the chest pain, and preventing damage than swallowing it.
Slowly chew on a 325 mg tablet of aspirin while waiting to receive emergency attention.
Get the aspirin into your system as soon as possible.
 Sit down in a comfortable position and do your best to stay calm. Loosen or remove any restrictive clothing, and try to relax as best you can.
