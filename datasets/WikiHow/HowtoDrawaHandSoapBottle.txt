 Draw two straight parallel lines that curve at the end. Then draw a line that curves on both ends that connects the two parallel lines at the bottom. Then draw a line that curves on both ends downward to connect the parallel lines at the top. Then erase a space in the middle of that line.;
, Then draw two shorter lines inward leaving another small opening. Then draw 2 very small lines upward, and connect them.
 Then draw two tiny lines going outward that are the same size. Now draw two parallel lines that are larger than the tiny lines, going upward. Now draw two curved lines that curve on the right side and tilt to the left that connect on the curved part. On the left side where the lines tilt, connect the two lines using a tiny line.
