 This will bring up a drop-down box in the upper corner of the device.;
,, You'll see a button that your cursor should automatically be resting over, called "register".
 You'll be on a link labelled "If you already have an Amazon account".
 Press the down arrow key once in the center of the 5-way controller to skip down to the password box.
 If a letter repeats itself consecutively, give it an extra second in between character presses, as the device has a problem.
 It will then highlight the "Submit" button.
 Give it a few extra seconds. It takes a little bit longer to process the registration to your account for your device.
 If the register button is now labelled "deregister" along with your correct name that is listed to your Amazon account, you'll know that you've successfully registered the device.
