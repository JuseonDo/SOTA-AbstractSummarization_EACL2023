 If you're just starting out, you'll have two parks to chose from- the Lost Kingdom, and Halloween World.;
, The walkie talkie at the bottom displays a Build Rides, Attractions, Sideshows, Features, and Hire Staff button (all one button, it's on the top left),next, an info button for information on all your rides and staff, next, a map, in which you can see staff patrol areas, areas that are the most popular, most messy, etc,. The light bulb is for research, and the coins button is for Financial information. (Staff training, ticket price, and loans.
 Don't put them to close. Build security cameras around and hire staff.
 Your advisor will drive you crazy if you don't.
 A game over occurs when you are bankrupt for 6 months. If you're only about 1000 under or so, don't take out a loan.
 The low quality won't make a difference.
, Check the map for this.
 In research, don't do ride upgrades until everything else has been researched, that way, you can simply upgrade when its announced to avoid having to go to every ride to check if it has an upgrade.
