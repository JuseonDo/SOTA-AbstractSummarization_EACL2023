,, Set aside or compost. If you like zucchini cake, this is a great time to bake one to use up the pulp!

, Leave the hollow facing up.
 Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and carrot and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
 Bring to a boil.
 Cover the pan and reduce the heat. Simmer for 12 minutes but keep an eye on it in case the quinoa soaks up all of the liquid.
 Cover again and simmer for 2 more minutes. The spinach should appear wilted.
 Spoon into each zucchini boat evenly.
 Spoon over the remaining chopped tomatoes. Sprinkle the top with cheese or breadcrumbs and olive oil.
 Slip in the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until the zucchini is tender.
 Just before serving, sprinkle a little parsley over each boat. Bon appétit!
