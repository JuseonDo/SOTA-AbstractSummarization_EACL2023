 A pull station is the device found on the wall with instructions such as "pull down".;
,,, The pull station cover might sound a local alarm, but it doesn't set off the building's fire alarm system. To set off the building's fire alarm system, you have to pull the lever.
 These have a striker plate with spikes which breaks a glass sheet, releasing a button within the station. To activate one of these, simply:


Find the nearest station.






Using the side of your clenched fist, forcefully strike the plate that rests in front of the glass sheet.






Sometimes the glass gets so old it thickens and might not break from the impact of your fist, and you obviously don't have time to locate a bodybuilder. Therefore you might have to hit it several more times, kick the station, or use something with more heft (bookbag, baseball bat, etc).






If that still does not work, you'll have to find another pull station in a safe location quickly.
 These are much larger than normal pull stations and have a gear mechanism that is wound up when pulled. This mechanism pulses a code (ex.:1-4-2) to the horns/bells that building security would use to determine where the fire is.


Find the nearest pull station






The lever in these pull stations will go back up, so don't go crazy pulling it over and over, it works just fine. However, these pull stations only transmit four rounds of code before resetting themselves, so you might need to pull it more than once if security doesn't come right away, and preferably tell somebody about the fire after pulling a second time.
 they will more likely have what are called call points. These look like pull stations but instead use a thin piece of glass to hold the button in. Simply:


Locate the nearest call point.






Press your thumb on the center dot (usually with an "X" or "O" in it), breaking the glass and releasing the button.
