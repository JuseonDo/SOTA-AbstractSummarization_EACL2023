, All this stuff came from somewhere. Try to enact some measures to stem the flow. A very good method of preventing impulse buys is to use cash and only bring enough for your planned purchases. Not only will you buy less junk - you will save your money!

, What is junk to you may be valuable to someone else.
, These are locale-based free exchange groups where people post items that they no longer need, but that might still have use or value for someone. No cash/barter allowed.
 It can be tricky, but if you take the time to find a charity that you really support, you will always know where to send your stuff.
 Earth 911 can search for nearby places to take all your donations, recyclables, and hazardous waste. If Earth 911 doesn't have anything to say, you can take it to the dump with a totally clean conscience.
 If you haven't used something in several years, get rid of it!
