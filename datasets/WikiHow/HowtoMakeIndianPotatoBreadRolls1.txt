 Add the oil and heat gently over medium heat. Add the cumin seed and cook until it begins cracking. Then add the peas, green chili and ginger. Stir together briefly.
 Stir through. Then add the chili and mango powders, the salt and cilantro/coriander. Stir in and fry for a minute, then remove from the heat.

Do a taste test to check that you like the flavor. It should be quite spicy as the bread will soften the taste a little.
 Each ball or cylinder should contain about 1 and half tablespoons of the filling each. This will make around one dozen., Cut into halves., Dip lightly (don't soak). Press between both palms to squeeze out the excess water. This is done to moisten the bread and make it easier to shape around the filling., Press the bread around the ball or cylinder, molding it to the filling to form the roll., Set aside to firm for five to ten minutes. The water will also reduce during this time, which makes for better frying., Heat over medium to high heat., Add only as many as the pan can handle without overlapping them.

Drop in with care, as the oil will splatter.
 Turn them using a spatula or tongs every now and then. In all, they should cook within two to three minutes., Let sit briefly to drain., These go well with chutney of your choice.
