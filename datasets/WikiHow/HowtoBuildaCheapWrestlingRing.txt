 Also, think about the size of your audience. Will it be large or small?;
, Most of these items can either be purchased or if possible maybe a junkyard for the like say the tires.
 Make sure that you use enough plywood so it's high enough.
 Once the bed is full, put a layer of something soft like a bunch of old blankets or a lot of towels, and put them over the tires.
, Then, connect them to the sides of the ring in the corners.
 Using a drill, screw in eye hooks into the ring posts (three in each post).
 After all hooks are attached using a bunch or rope, thread it through the eye hook all the way around the ring, creating a square.
