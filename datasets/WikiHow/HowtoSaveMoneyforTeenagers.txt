 Find out your allowance or payment (if you have a job) and calculate how much you make per (week, month).;
, Find out a reasonable guess of the amount of money you spend per (week, month) and find the difference.
 Ask to mow lawns, do the dishes, or tutor your neighbor. Try selling old junk to others. If you're old enough, consider getting a job.
 If you get a schedule worked out for something your doing for extra money (mowing, cleaning, etc.), it will make you and your customers' lives easier.
 Give yourself amounts that you're willing to spend each month on desired items, but then stick to the budget. Don't buy things that go above and beyond your allotted spending, so that you can still save the difference.
 You could wash cars too.
, Make sure you are never tempted to waste the money on useless things. Try taping it shut with heavy duty tape so you can't get into it.Â Also, bank accounts are a great way to save up.
 Happy savings!
