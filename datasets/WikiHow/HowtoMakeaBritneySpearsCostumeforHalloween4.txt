, If you have a minidress with a corset top, that's even better. If not, you can get a white lace tablecloth and tie it haphazardly around your waist to create a makeshift skirt. Vintage clothing stores would be good places to look for such items.



To make this yourself, get a plain tablecloth and fold it into rectangle about ten to twelve inches wide. The length should be long enough so that it wraps around your waist just once.
Wrap the tablecloth high enough so that about two to four inches of your ruffly, lacy skirt peeks through the bottom -- though remember that the skirt's edge should be uneven.
Safety pin it on the side to keep it in place.

 If you have longer hair, consider getting it heavily layered and tucking the longest strands behind your back.
 Apply foundation and bronzer to smooth over blemishes and add definition to your cheeks. Wear black eyeliner and the eyeshadow that pairs with your eye color the best. Make your lips stand out with a bright, cherry red shade, characteristic of the rebellious bride look.
