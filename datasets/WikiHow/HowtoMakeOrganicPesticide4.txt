 Tobacco is useful in targeting caterpillars, aphids, and worms, but it is not safe to use on peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, or any member of the solanaceous plant family.
 Allow it to rest for 24 hours.
 Ideally, the pesticide will look similar to the hue of a light tea. If it is too dark, dilute it with water. If it is too light to see, allow it to sit an additional few hours., Mix thoroughly.
 Shake the solution inside the bottle once more to combine it further.
 Focus on areas that show the most damage, but also cover spots that still seem in good condition.
