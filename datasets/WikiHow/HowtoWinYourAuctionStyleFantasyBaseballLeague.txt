 How will you spend that money on the 23 positions available?;
,, On this list, have the most you are willing to pay for a player, and set yourself at that price. Don't go too hard after certain players because they play for your home team.
 $1 players are usually the backups, or subpar starters.
, A well-balanced team may leave you smack dab in the middle of the standings, unable to dominate in any particular statistic.
, Take the redeemers and reap the rewards.



If your league has minor league and minor league picks, use those in your trades.
Trade for categories you are in need of, not something you are already strong in.
 If you read the book, you realize Billy Beane is just running a de facto fantasy baseball team. Though you needn't overanalyze your fantasy team, general principles outlined in the book for picking players can be useful. Joe Shlabotnik's .350 batting average means diddly squat next year, because he can't walk and can't hit for power. Only fools would pick Shlabotnik high in next year's fantasy draft.
 Advanced statistics can be good as predictive tools, but in the end the league will likely be scored based upon more simplistic statistics.
 As the great P.T. Barnum once said, "there's a sucker born every minute.",and this applies even in fantasy baseball leagues. You will almost surely have someone in your league who insists on buying high and selling low and riding every player's short-lived wave of success for all it's worth. Use them to purchase players with high upside for nominal prices.
