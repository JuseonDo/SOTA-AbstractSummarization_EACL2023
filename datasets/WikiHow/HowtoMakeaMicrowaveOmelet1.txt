 The cooking time will vary from microwave to microwave. In most cases, it will take about 45 seconds on a high-heat setting.


This will make the omelet richer. If you wish to save some time, you can simply use cooking spray.;
, This will prevent the egg from getting baked onto the bowl and make clean-up easier. If you used cooking spray, you can skip this step.
 Keep beating until the yolks are all broken up and everything is evenly combined. There should be no streaks of egg yolk and egg white.
 You can also cover it with a microwave-safe plate instead. This will prevent the eggs from expanding out of the dish and making a mess.
 After about 30 seconds, pause the microwave, and use a fork to push the cooked edges of the omelet towards the center., Once the eggs have thickened and no liquid remains, take the dish out of the microwave and pull off the plastic wrap. Place the filling over half of the omelet.Some of the fillings, such as herbs and cheese can be used fresh, but other fillings, such as ham and bacon, need to be cooked first.


You can use things like diced ham, chopped onions, or shredded cheese.
You can use just one ingredient for the filling, or play around with different combinations.

 Tuck a spatula under the bare side of the omelet, and flip it over so that it covers the filling.
 If you'd like, you can garnish it with some more of your filling, or fresh herbs, such as chives.
