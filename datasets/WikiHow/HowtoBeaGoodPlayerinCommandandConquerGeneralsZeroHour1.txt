 Knowing your environment is a key point towards your victory in a battle especially when we are talking about skirmish conflicts. Be familiar of your surroundings; where is the possible ground zero of your enemy? Determine where the resources are. Scout for areas where you can set your flank to defend your base. Observe the enemy's possible route when performing offensive operations. Search for safe areas where you can settle your troops. A good commander doesn't make a move without knowing the environment of his battlefield.;
, A good general never underestimates his enemy. Is the enemy using toxins? Is the enemy good at stealth? Does your enemy have a large amount of tanks in his disposal? What are the strengths of the enemy? How can you exterminate them without a lot of casualties? Determine the behavior and the capability of your enemy before making any operations.
 Defense is important and you are playing blind when you don't know how to set a good defense. Once your defenses are good. You are impenetrable and the possibility of getting defeated decreases.
 Determine their strengths and weaknesses. Know when you are going to use them. Know their strengths. For example, are they good at tank busting? Good at anti-aircraft busting? All units must move by placing them in strategic positions.
 It is good both in offensive and defensive operations.
, Destroy its defenses to assure minimal casualties once the offensive team arrives.
 That way, they won't go far deep in your defenses.


This strategy is good for generals who want adhesive actions.
 This might harm a lot of your units, so a good general sends out scouts first before letting their units on a patrol.
 When an air raid happens, you'll lose a lot.
