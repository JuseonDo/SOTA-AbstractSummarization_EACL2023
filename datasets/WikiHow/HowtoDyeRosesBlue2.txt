 Clean and skim the thorns. This time, it is okay to skim some of the stem., Mix blue flower dye in with some water in a vase, then add some more dye, making a thin and watery dye., Color each of them. Stand the dyed roses next to a fan, holding a blue rose to let the dye dry.

Place plastic sheeting under the fan, to catch any drips from the blue dye.
