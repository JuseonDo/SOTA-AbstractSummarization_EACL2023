, If you have a ton of shoes but preserving them is worth it as it makes creasing nearly impossible.
 Even the lightest rain can damage your shoes and cut off a year in its life.
 If you have a lot of shoes, then schedule when you'll wear them. It sounds like high maintenance but you'll be glad you did it!

, Try Mr. Clean 's Magic Eraser.
 Just put them back in the box.
 Light ages a shoe and the material.
, You only use the front of your foot to hit the pedals and that creates a 45 degree crease angle and your shoe will crease. Try bringing an extra pair of old shoes!

, Continuous cleaning from water creates oxidation in the air and that very air you breathe creates a chemical compound that creates the infamous yellowing found on famous Jordans like the 5's,6's,11's,and 16's. The less water, the better and the less cleaning, the better.
