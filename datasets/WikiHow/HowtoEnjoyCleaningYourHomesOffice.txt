 Sometimes we find ourselves overlooking a lot of problems, because we don't want to spend the time to fix it.;
, This way, you'll be able to dance while you clean.
 Tell them that you will be playing a game. One of you will count to 30, with their eyes closed, while the other cleans as much as possible. Then, you switch.
 Check off what is done, and, if anything isn't done, see who can clean the most items, while dancing.
 Phew! Take a break, watch a short show, eat a snack, and relax.
 Scrub the desk, and any other furniture, to make sure there are no sticky messes, and dust everything else.
 Slide across it a few times in your socks, to make sure there's no leftover dust.
 Good Job!
