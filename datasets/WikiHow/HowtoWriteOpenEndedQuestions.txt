@summary
think on a deep level (get to a place where you can completely focus on something, then focus on this).

@summary
start by planning your day or week (what ever is easiest for you) then, pick out each situation you might get into where you need to ask these questions.

@summary
take the easiest situations and write out a short script of how a conversation would typically go (with all the positive and negative parts).

@summary
after you've scripted out a short or long conversation (again, what ever is easier), rewrite it so you can fit in some open ended questions!,

@summary
practice using open ended questions.

@summary
apply your trial and error on the many situations that matter just a little until you have it as a habit.
@article
 Ask your self "What's an open ended question? You will find an open ended question is the opposite of a closed ended question, meaning a question someone can't answer yes or no only to. Seriously ingrain it into your mind so you never have to ever ask that again! Understanding is the key.;
, Making it personal will help you learn it on a deeper level.
 All the good and the bad.
 It's best to replace some response with one or two, because that will keep some balance to the equation. Too much info can overwhelm anyone so know them before you try to test your new "script". Even if it's just writing it out, when you're successful at implementing an open ended question on paper, you might internalize that success and actually do that when you have a conversation with them.
 The more you script it out, the easier it will be to practice. If you say the wrong thing or accidentally use a closed ended question and sabotage your self out of habit, just take note of it. Then when you try again to plan it ahead of time you can remember "well Susie has the best smile so I need to remember to use bigger words to distract me from that". Or "the boss is so smart, I know if I get too close to him I need to use words that distract me from him or else I will stutter for sure". Some pit falls can be totally avoided if you pay attention, note them, keep trying and be persistent. Until you can overcome the pitfalls and or use open ended questions automatically.
 Then when you have done it enough to the point you can do it easily, apply this new knowledge on paper with essays or say in the toast masters (where you can get some really good training). The more practice the easier the task.
