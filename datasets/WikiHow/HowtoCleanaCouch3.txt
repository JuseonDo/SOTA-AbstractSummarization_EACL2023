 Because of the quick evaporation time, rubbing alcohol will not leave a mark on fabrics like polyester and microfiber like water does. It will have a scent while you are cleaning, but will leave no scent after the task has been completed.
 Use a sponge to scrub these areas, lifting dirt from the upholstery. Don’t spray large sections at a time, as you don’t won’t have time to scrub it all before the alcohol evaporates.
 Move the brush in small circular motions to return the fabric back to its previous state.
 Your clean couch is now ready to be sat in again!
