@article
 Pile lots of things on top of it, like clothes, games e.t.c;
, Like tag, Ghost in the graveyard or Murder in the dark. Do a few rounds of Truth or Dare. Laugh lots!

, This is a GREAT way to get your adrenaline pumping. Call a friend and yell "QUICK! THE POO IS FALLING FROM YOUR ROOF!". If it's someone very close, whisper "I'm watching you". Be sure to say who you are after, it's better that way.


The first person (or the host's sibling) to fall asleep gets to be drew on. Try not to laugh though, it will give the game away.
 Be creative! Choose anything, a beard, a mustache, "I LOVE POO" on their forehead.
 That is important, so they don't suspect you! Or, put it somewhere like in the Cookie jar or in the Sugar pot?

, Say "Woah, where'd you get the nice tattoo?. Or say "Great..you love poo!".
