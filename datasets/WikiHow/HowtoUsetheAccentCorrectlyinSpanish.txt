@article
 The accented syllable is the one that gets the most emphasis or that you dwell on a bit longer. For example: comida, teléfono, chocolate.;
, For example: teléfono, sólo.
 These are words that have the accented syllable second from the end: fácil, césped, mártir, álbum.
, For example, Aún podemos hacerlo. (We can still do it.), Aún hay esperanzas. (There is still hope). On the other hand, aun has no accent if it means "even". For instance, Aun cuando quisiera, no podría hacerlo (Even when I want to, I couldn't do it.) Aun él tendrá que escucharme. (Even he will have to listen to me.)

, If it means "alone," no accent is needed.



Sólo sé que no sé nada. (I only know that I know nothing.)

Luís vive solo. (Luís lives alone.)

,



Sí, puedo ir si mi mamá me permite. (Yes, I can go if my mom lets me.)

, For example rápidamente (quickly, rapidly) has an accent because rápida has an accent. Thus, "rápida"+"mente" has an accent. By contrast, posiblemente doesn't have an accent, since posible, originally, doesn't either. Hence, "posible"+"mente" has no accent.
 In general, use the accent if the pronoun is a subject or object. Do not use the accent if the pronoun is possessive. The words "conmigo" and "contigo" have no accents.
