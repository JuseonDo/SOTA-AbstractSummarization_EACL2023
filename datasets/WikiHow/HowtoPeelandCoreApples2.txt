 For best results, start at the top of the apple and circle down the circumference of the apple. When done correctly, the peel should come off all in one piece.
 To do so, place it stem up on a cutting board and cut down from the center of the stem.
 Place the halves flat side down on the cutting board and cut each half in half, making quarters.
 Hold each quarter with the rounded side facing in your palm. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a large "V" around the core.
, Usually, a recipe will either call for apple wedges or apple cubes.









To cut wedges, set each quarter so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut each wedge in half to make 1/8 inch (3.4mm) slices.
To cut cubes, set each quarter on the cutting board so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut the quarter lengthwise into strips approximately 1/3" (3.4mm) wide. Finish by cutting it width-wise into strips approximately 1/3" (3.4mm) wide. The result will be many 1/3" x 1/3" (3.4mm x 3.4mm) chunks.
