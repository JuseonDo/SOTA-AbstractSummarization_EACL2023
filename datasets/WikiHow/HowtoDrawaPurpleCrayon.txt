 In this article, we'll use purple. Use a crayon or colored pencil of that color. A color pencil will give a somewhat finer line than a crayon.
 Looking at the real thing will help you get the proportions and decorations about right., You can use a ruler to keep them nice and straight, or you can draw them freehand for a more artistic look., Complete the ellipse at the top end., Make them parallel to your first two lines and inside them a little bit., Try to make it look like the others., This is two more lines, this time slanting inwards to another small half-ellipse.,,, Also, write in the color of your crayon.

If you're going to write something in your decal, it will help it come out centered to write, then draw the shape around it.
 Shade it darkly around the edges, lighter in the center. Go parallel to the lines on either side. Shade the ends, where the wax is, darker than the label.,, It can make it look like it is popping up out of the page it's drawn on.

Remember: light travels in a straight line, so draw a crayon-shaped shadow and put the end of it just opposite where the light appears to be.
