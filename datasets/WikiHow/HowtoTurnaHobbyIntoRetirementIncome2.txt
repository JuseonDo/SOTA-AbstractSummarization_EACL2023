Before jumping into retirement careers, investigate the competition, the costs involved in starting the business and any legal requirements for operating the business.



A business plan acts as a road map, clarifying the expenses associated with starting and running the business and keeping the entrepreneur focused on the steps necessary to make the business work.
 A retiree can probably produce knitted products from home but would need to rent or buy property to run a sports camp for kids.



Take into consideration the costs of raw materials, office or real estate expenses, product pricing and the desired income level.



Many retirees first tap into their personal resources to start their retirement careers.
If the business requires substantial start-up funds, grants and loans may be available for small business owners.
