 It contains petroleum distillates that will dissolve the adhesive left behind by tape, bumper stickers, and other self-adhesive appliqu√©s. It says right on the can that it will remove grease, tar, and adhesives.;
, You will probably be ok using it on porcelain cast-iron tubs, but may not be ok for plastic or fiberglass tubs. Always test first.
 You can use a plastic scraper (or an old credit card) to help scrape the adhesive off without scratching the surface. Wipe up with paper towels or similar absorbent cloth.
 WD-40 has warnings on the can about proper ventilation, flammability, and the danger of breathing the vapors. Read the warnings and follow their advice.
 Do not attempt to use the bathtub until the WD-40 has been washed away. (Try using Soft Scrub). The bathtub will be very slippery until the WD-40 gets washed away and you could easily slip and fall, injuring yourself if you don't clean the WD-40 thoroughly from the tub surface.
