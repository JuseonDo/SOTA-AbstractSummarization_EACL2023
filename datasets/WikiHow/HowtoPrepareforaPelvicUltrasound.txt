check if you are having a transabdominal (full bladder) exam or an endovaginal/intravaginal (empty bladder) exam.realize that everyone's kidneys produce urine at a different rate, so the instructions given to you by the clinic are aimed at the patient with the slowest bladder filling time.

@summary
drink four (4) 8-ounce glasses of water one hour before the exam which is the usual requirement for the test.

@summary
start earlier if you think you will be unable to drink the full amount.

@summary
drink your water a bit closer to the exam time if you drink coffee or other caffeinated products, or take a diuretic (water pill).

@summary
make sure to have breakfast on the day of the exam.

@summary
hydrate yourself well by drinking water or other clear fluids the day before the exam.

@summary
be aware that you may feel uncomfortable, but not painfully full when your bladder is the correct fullness.

@summary
know that when the bladder is too full for the exam, it is actually in spasm so beginning to pee is difficult.

 If it's the latter, read Prepare for an Intravaginal Ultrasound. Otherwise, continue here.
, This means empty your bladder about 2 hrs before the exam time, then drink 32 oz of water over the next hour. Do not empty your bladder until the ultrasound technologist tells you., If you are unable to keep the water down (vomiting), it is likely your bladder will not be full enough because you are already dehydrated. Explain this to the technologist or your doctor. They have the option of doing an endovaginal/intravaginal ultrasound instead., Your bladder will fill more quickly on the day of the exam., Otherwise you will be dehydrated and will need more than the 4 glasses to fill your bladder. Likewise, things like partying with alcohol, a long airline flight, or too much coffee the day before the examination will also dehydrate you., On the day, you should be able to get by with only 3 glasses of water., If you are painfully full, be assured that you can empty your bladder quite a bit, and you will still fill back up within 30 minutes or so if you have taken all the required fluids., Let out enough to be more comfortable (more than 2 cups), then stop the flow with the pelvic muscles, or by starting to stand up, holding toilet paper to catch any remainder. Remember, if you let out too much, you will fill back up again.
