 This trick might sound a little funny and ridiculous, but it's been proven to work.Eggs are rich in protein, which is what your hair is made out of. Giving your hair some new fresh protein can help rebuild your hair strands.
 Crack 2 eggs into the bowl and stir them well.
 Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.
 Shampoo and condition as normal.
