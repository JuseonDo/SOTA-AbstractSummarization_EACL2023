Be ready to respond to take advantage of Craigslist’s social power.


Craigslist asks that you post to a single category and single location only once within 48 hours for each topic.
 Click on it. Select the type of post you are offering, such as “event” or “housing offered.”

,, Be specific and specify a limited time, amount of money or qualification required. Use the best possible keywords in the title, so that people can search for your listing.
 Unless you want your personal email to show up on the listing, select the radio button to use a craigslist coded email relay. This allows you to use your email to receive messages, but still remain anonymous on the site itself.
 If you are selling items, you should always include images that help the viewer to see the condition of the item.
 Preview it and edit it before it goes live. If you like how it looks, publish it.

 Generally, the sooner you reply to the post, the more likely you are to get results from it., Many people use it primarily for furniture, technology, events and job postings. You may find you get better results selling smaller items on eBay or Amazon, since people are more accustomed to those forums for used items.
 Search online for the purchase price of a used item. Take into account the condition of the item as well. If you are selling on Craigslist, use this method to set your price.
 Usually, the seller will indicate a price and add “OBO” or “or best offer” if they want to get rid of it quickly. If demand is likely to be high, you are more likely to need to buy it at the full listed price.
 Being one of the first people to respond is your best chance to get the item.
 Convenience and reliability are good reasons for someone to write you back and arrange the sale.
 Always bring someone else with you to help with transportation and provide an assurance of safety.

With Craigslist, the standard is cash on delivery.
