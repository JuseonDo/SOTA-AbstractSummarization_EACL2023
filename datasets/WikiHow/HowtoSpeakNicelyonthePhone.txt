@article
 when you pick up. If it is not your own home phone say, "Hello, (last name) residence, may I ask who is calling?". Some feel a friendly "Hello?" is OK, but others like to address the place. See what fits you.;
, If it happens that you are unable to find the person they are trying to call within 30 seconds to a minute of putting them on hold, apologize in a calm and polite tone of voice, "I'm sorry, John is unavailable right now. Would you like me to take a message and have John call you back, (callers name)?"

, A good way is to say: "They aren't able to come to the phone right now, would you like me to take a message?"

, "This is Jane, (state your relation to the person calling: friend, schoolmate, etc.) may I speak to John?" Say it in a calm, polite tone of voice.
