, Since you'll be tracing the shorts onto the pants, you don't want to risk the chance of staining the outside of your pants!, Smooth it out and make sure it is even., If the hems don't line up, your shorts will not be the right length., Try to make the line as smooth and even as possible. It may be helpful to have someone hold out the fabric of the pant leg as you trace. This line is the length of your shorts., This line is where you'll cut the shorts, since to make the hem, you'll need some additional fabric to fold up.

Again, it may be helpful to have someone hold the fabric while you trace.
 Make sure you use sharp scissors and cut the line as straight as possible.,

Make sure the bobbin and the thread are the same color! The bobbin, since it's hidden, is easy to forget about - but it can make a big difference if you have blue and orange thread!
Take off the part on your sewing machine that can be removed to sew things like sleeves - it will be a whole lot easier to sew the legs of the pants!
Make sure the sewing machine is threaded properly - nothing is more annoying than sewing a whole project, then realizing the bobbin wasn't threaded!

, If you pin the wrong way, you'll sew it the wrong way- and have the hem of your shorts on the front!, Make sure you are folding the fabric so the front fabric shows on the inside of the shorts. As you fold, pin. If you fold it all at once, it will just become unraveled.

It may help to do it one leg at a time.
 Make sure you move the leg around in one smooth, even line. If you are making a double hem, sew a second line in the same manner.,, Use a serger or make a French seam.
 This will give them a crisp look., Since you're already making a new item, why not make it look completely new? Here are some ideas:

Paint designs onto the legs.
Add jewels.
Cut off two strips on the sides of each leg and tie them.
