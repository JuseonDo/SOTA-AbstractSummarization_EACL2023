 Use different forms of resistance (dumbbells, stretch bands, cable machines, kettlebells, sandbags, etc) and different set/rep patterns. Try exercises from various angles as well to create a challenge for your body.;
, Try supersetting exercises (performing two different exercise sets back to back without a break). This will increase your overall endurance and anaerobic capacity.
 For example, how often do you find yourself lying on your back and lifting something heavy over your chest? Probably the only time is in the gym doing bench presses. Instead, work on more common movements or change the exercise to perform it from a more common position. With bench press some examples include push-ups, standing cable press, or even punching motions with a stretch band or cable machine resistance.
 Typically when we need strength we are on our feet, so spend most of your exercise time on your feet.
 Try to use your glutes for balance when standing, your hips and obliques to generate twisting force, and your abs to create a tense and balanced position for the appropriate exercises.
, The rest periods should be only long enough to allow the heart to recover and fall back into an aerobic pace.
 Flexibility will greatly reduce your chance of injury during training and helps to create a more balanced physique.
 Eat healthy, natural foods that are high in protein and low in processed sugars and saturated fats.
