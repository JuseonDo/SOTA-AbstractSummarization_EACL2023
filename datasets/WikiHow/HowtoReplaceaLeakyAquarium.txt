 You will need lots of floor space and an easy lift of the old tank.;
, For every 30 inches (760 mm) of fish no bigger than 7 inches (180 mm) you will need one 5 gallon (20 L) bucket. If this is not available, use anything that won't be too small or have harmful residue in it.


Soaps and detergents are especially harmful to fish. If you must use a detergent bucket, rinse it very well first.
 Cover the buckets, so fish won't get out and cats, dogs, etc. won't get in.
 Remove gravel, plants, decor, and water. Then take the tank off the stand.
 Don't be too long on your trip. There's no reason you can't purchase the new tank before you start this exchange.
 Place the new tank in the old location. Then, add the Decor, gravel, heater, filter, light, old water, fish, plants, and everything from the old tank. Plug everything in and top off the tank.


If you have lost a lot of water, you may want to top up the missing quantity somewhat gradually, over a period of hours or even days, provided the fish have enough volume in which to live meanwhile.
Treat the replacement water as usual before adding it, including neutralizing chlorine or chloramine, adjusting the pH if you normally do, and adding any salts if your aquarium needs them.
 are all normal for your tank.
