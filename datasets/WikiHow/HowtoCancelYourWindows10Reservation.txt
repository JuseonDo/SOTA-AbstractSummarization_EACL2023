Note: If you do not see “Check your upgrade status” in the context menu, then you have not yet made a reservation for a Windows 10 upgrade, so you have nothing to cancel.

Cancel?” Confirm that you want to cancel your reservation by clicking (tapping) the “Cancel reservation” button on the lower right side of the screen.

You’re done. Click (tap) the “Close” button to exit the window.
