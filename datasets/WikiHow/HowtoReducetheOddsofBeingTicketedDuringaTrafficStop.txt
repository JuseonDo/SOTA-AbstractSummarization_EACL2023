 Officers have a lot to worry about when they pull someone over; you can defray a lot of these worries by taking the following steps.
 Find an area that will give the officer plenty of space to walk up to your window without being close to oncoming traffic., Do this as soon as you pull over. Turn on your overhead interior light unless it's very bright outside. This gives the officer a chance to see more clearly that there aren't any threats in the car., Don't move around, and don't reach for your license and registration. Any movement can make the officer nervous that you're reaching for a gun or trying to hide something., say "No. I'm sorry, but I don't," and leave it at that. You might feel tempted to confess, but if you do, the officer can write that on the ticket and you'll have a hard time getting away from that later., This will help put the officer at ease. The officer will probably go back to the police car to run your information; wait patiently with your hands at 10 and 2 on the wheel. Don't rummage, fidget, make phone calls, etc., Don't argue. Your best chance of fighting this ticket now is for the officer to not remember you, so don't do anything that might make you stand out in his or her mind. This will make it more likely that the officer will agree to a plea deal down the line.,,,
