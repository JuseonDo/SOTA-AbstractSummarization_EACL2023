 Pichu can only be found in the patch of grass near the exit to Iki Town, so go there. You have a 5% chance of finding one, so it may take a while to do so.;
,, Be careful not to faint it, or you'll have to search for another one.
 Any ball will do. Your best bet is to use a Nest Ball, since it'll be at a low level.
