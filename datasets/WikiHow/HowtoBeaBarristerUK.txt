 The start to any law career is studying law at A Level, to get into a degree you will need three A Levels (and possibly one AS) which include law, other subjects, such as English, may help, or other academic subjects.As you will be studying law for two years, the best thing is to do is practice and practice exam questions. AS is a lot easier than A2, therefore try to achieve full marks/high marks at AS to help at A2.;
, For universities, the standard entry requirements is 3 A's at A Level, including law.Two AS Levels cannot be used instead of one A Level. For moreÂ prestigious universities, the requirements will be higher.
 These will be through lectures or independent study time:Tort
Contract
EU
Land
Public
Private
Equity & trust.



If you already have a degree in another subject but want to go into law, there is a conversion course called the Graduate Diploma in Law where you will study the same seven subjects but within one year full time.
 Here you will:Focus on advocacy
Opinion write on cases
Draft documents
Learn negotiation.
 You are required to dine there at least 12 times by the end of the course, with other barristers.,, This is where you will work for one year and be paid for it; the training is split into two six-month periods., For the second six months you will conduct your own cases but still be overseen by the pupil master, who can also assist.
 Well done! You have successfully completed all the training, now you must seek tenancy (a job) within a chambers so you can start conducting cases as a permanent member.
 After 10 years of service, you are able to apply to the Queens Counsel which has many benefits.Enjoy the job.
