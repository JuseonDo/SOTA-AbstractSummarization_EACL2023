 For a more in-depth explanation, see How to Write a Well Received Question or Answer on Stack Exchange.
 The question that you answer should be something that you have experience in, or have researched.


Never ask or answer blindly on a topic. When asking, make sure that the question is well researched and something that you genuinely know about. If you are answering your own question, make sure that you can answer the question with a good, well-researched response.
 Your post should have research. Make the post look tidy link by hyperlinking all external or internal links.


Even if it takes you several days or hours, a well-researched post will do better than a non-researched post.
 Make sure that it contains good punctuation and spelling. When in doubt of the quality, ask a proofreader to help out. You may even find someone on the site that you can trust to do this task.
