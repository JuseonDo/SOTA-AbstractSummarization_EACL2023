 Container gardens dry out much quicker than ground gardens. The best times to water are early morning (the moisture will serve the plants all day) and early evening (the moisture will help the plants recover from a day of sunlight and heat.)

,,, Container gardens, including those planted in dresser drawers, have the benefit of being mobile. If you have a wagon, place the drawer on the wagon and move it throughout the day to get the most sun exposure.
 This will help to produce the best possible flavors.







The jalapeño peppers are 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in length and somewhere between a dark green and a bright red (bright red spots mean the pepper is ripening further, which is perfectly ok.)






The shoots on the onions and garlic are beginning to turn yellow and dry out. Note: This is not required - both can be harvested while shoots are still green and fresh-looking.
