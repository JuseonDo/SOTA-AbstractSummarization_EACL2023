, Consider using either a very shallow bowl or even a plate to hold the egg. You will be rolling the cheese stick in the egg so you want a bowl/plate that will provide decent coverage.
 Like with the egg, you may want to just combine the ingredients in a bowl, but then place crumb mixture on a plate for easier coating.
 Dip cheese stick in the egg, covering the stick completely with egg.
, The double dipping will give more of a “fried” feel to the cheese sticks.
,, Bake for five to six minutes, or until golden brown.


Cheese may melt, so push the cheese back into place, and into the cheese stick shape.
 Allow baked cheese sticks to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your easy baked mozzarella sticks.
