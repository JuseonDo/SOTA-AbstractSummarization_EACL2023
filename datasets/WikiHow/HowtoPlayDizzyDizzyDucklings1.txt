;
, The starting line can be anywhere you want. Also, remember to mark the finishing line. The track should be about 10 foot (3.0Â m) for beginners, but as everyone begins to understand and play the game more, the distance can be increased.
 Dizzy dizzy dee! We are swimming to the sea!" Then everyone tries to spin to the finish line. If you fall just get back up again!

, Put everyone's name in the 1st vertical column and then in the next column put their rank e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.
 Dizzy dizzy doo! We are coming back to you!' Everyone spins back to the start. Again, in the last column, put everyone's rank from the last run.
 You can make up your own points, but here are some suggestions: 1st place gets 10 points, 2nd places gets 9 points, 3rd place gets 8 points, 4th place gets 7 points, 5th place gets 6 points, etc.
 Whoever has the most points wins!
