 Cutting the roll in half is a good option but you may like the doll taller or shorter.;
,, In a large bowl, mix the strips with craft glue and water. Mix with your hands until they make a paper pulp.
 Create a slightly raised mound at one end to serve as the minion doll's head. The other end should be left flat, in line with the cardboard roll's base. Let the pulp dry inside the roll––it will dry fastest if left in direct sun for 5-6 hours. The finished roll forms the body of the minion doll.
 Poke holes in each side of the roll where arms should sit. Insert the arms into the holes.


The length that you cut the arms will depend on the size of the body you've created for your minion doll.
 Either cover the head with yellow paper (such as tissue paper or cellophane) or paint the head yellow. Alternatively, cut a ping pong ball in half, glue onto the head end of the doll and paint it yellow (if it's already yellow, don't paint it).
 Use a non-absorbent acrylic yellow paint.
 Use pen refills or toothpicks to create the minion doll's legs. Cut to size and glue the chosen leg materials to the bottom of your minion.
 This will help to make them thick. Make the feet base flat so that the minion doll won't fall when it is made to stand.
 Glue each item to the minion doll.
 Use yellow and blue colors. See the image for one idea.
 Use black permanent marker to create a mouth shape. Paint the hands and shoes black.
 For example, paint on goggles, a headband and any hair.
 Let it dry for a day. Your minion doll is now ready for action or display.
