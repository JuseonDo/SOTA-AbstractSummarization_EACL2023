start numbering with the bottom, since the lowest, thinnest string is always your first string.

@summary
know the second string, the second from the bottom, is a b.

@summary
know the third string, the third from the bottom, is a g. notice how, on many guitars, there are two “types” of strings – the thinner silver ones on the bottom, and thicker, wound strings on top.

@summary
know the fourth string, the third from the top, is a d. the fourth string, or the third from the top, is a d in standard tuning.

 The hardest thing to remember about guitar stringing is that it starts from the bottom, not the top. Your thinnest string is the first string. It is almost always silver and "unwound," compared to the thick, coated strings further up the guitar.









This string is an E. It is sometimes known as the “high-E,” since the top string is a much lower sounding E note.;
, The second string is the second thinnest string, one up from the bottom. It is a B.
 The G is usually the last unwound string.
 All of the notes here are for standard tuning, which is how guitars are strung in 90% of modern music. The numbers of the strings do not change based on tuning.
 This is the second string from the top, and also the second thickest string. This is an A.
 This is often known as the “low-E” as well, or sometimes the “bass string.” No matter what, know that it is the sixth string of the guitar.
