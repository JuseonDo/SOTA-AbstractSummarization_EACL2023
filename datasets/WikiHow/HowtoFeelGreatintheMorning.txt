 Bend over and touch your toes. It is good to hold a stretch for at least 10 seconds. You should push yourself to feel tension, but not pain. If you need to, you can do this sitting down as well!;
,,, You don't have to do lots; just a few to get your blood circulating.
, On a step, stand with just your toes on the step, with your weight pushing down. Let your feet relax and your toes will get pushed up. You should feel tension in back of your lower legs, called your calf muscles.
 This is a good thing. Make sure to eat something clean and healthy. Fruits, or simple proteins work best in the morning. Eggs, cheese, yogurt, or cottage cheese are good options for morning meals. Avoid eating a large portion or heavy carbs.
 During the day, if you can, try to drink a few bottles of water, and at the end of the day drink another 2-4 glasses with dinner, etc. This may seem like a lot at first, but your body actually does need 8-10 glasses of water to stay correctly hydrated. You may have to use the restroom more than usual when you first start. This is only temporary! As your body gets used to having all the water it needs, it will absorb into your system and your restroom visits will return to normal.
 Meditation, or deep breathing exercises, for at least 5 minutes each morning can help facilitate a fresh mindset for the day and relieve the burden of unwanted tensions and anxieties. Just twice a day is all you need, once before bed is shown to clear the mind for sleep, and when you wake up - to set your fresh mind for the day.
 You must get a good sleep!

,, You don't want to be waking up in the middle of the night.
