, Peel and cut the potatoes into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) cubes first, then put them into a large pot of water; the water should cover completely cover the potatoes. Cook the potatoes until they are done, about 15 to 20 minutes, then drain them.
 Put the potatoes back into the pot, and mash them with a potato masher. Don't worry about making them perfectly smooth just yet; they will become smoother once you add the milk and sour cream.
 Continue mashing the potatoes until everything is evenly combined. Once the potatoes are soft, you can stir them with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. The potatoes may look soupy at first, but they will eventually soak up the liquid and thicken up. Save the remaining ½ cup (50 grams) of cheese for later., You can cook your own bacon beforehand, or you can use the precooked, crumbled kind that comes from a package. Stir the potatoes until everything is evenly combined and distributed.
 Smooth the potatoes down first with a spatula; any peaks that are sticking up may get burned. Next, sprinkle the rest of the cheese over them. Do not stir the cheese in.
 The potatoes are ready when the cheese is melted and the potatoes are heated through.
 Let the potatoes cool a little first, then serve them while they are still hot. Cover and refrigerate any leftovers.
