normally, people ask “antivirus soft wares are supposed to be in-built for an os if they promise security, right?,

@summary
well the answer is, improved security is one of the promises offered by any os from its previous versions.

@summary
make sure you're a user with administrative rights.

@summary
go on to control panel -> system -> advanced tab, and under startup and recovery click settings.

@summary

@summary
a new window pops up, in which you must click the ‘edit’ button.

@summary
,

@summary
you should see a text file opening up.

@summary
in the last line you should see something like this “/noexecute=optin”.

@summary
now save the file and close it, for those who want to know where the actual dep is, under advanced tab click on settings which is under performance, you should find dep in the popped up window.

@summary
now restart the system, and feel the first speed boost to your xp system.

@summary
,since vista doesn’t allow you to directly edit the bootloader settings, here is how you do it in vista.

@summary
be sure to be a user with administrative rights.

@summary

@summary
click start -> run and then type in “command.com” without quotes and then you should have the command prompt.

@summary
,

@summary
in there, just type in the following and it doesn't matter which directory you're in.

@summary
,” bcdedit.exe /set {currentuser} nx alwaysoff ” (without quotes)

@summary
,

@summary
if you did it correctly, it will say “the command completed successfully”.

@summary
for vista users who do not own vista service pack 1, i would recommend you order it, and get it installed in your system as soon as you can.

@summary
if dep is disabled, doesn't that make my system more vulnerable to attacks though it improves my speed?”

@summary
3rd party antivirus softwares will rescue you from that trouble, that's what they were built for!

 So why is it that I can’t find it in my OS?”
, As in Windows, there are two things which can be obviously seen. One is the Windows Firewall, the other is Windows Defender. Both took a giant leap from XP to Vista. But there is a silent warrior performing security measures in Windows apart from the above two. Anyway, I am talking about the Data Execution Prevention(DEP for short) module in Windows systems. By default, it is started up both in XP and Vista when the system boots up, their capabilities are widespread, but in a nutshell what they do, is they monitor every file in your OS, when they are MODIFIED, even in the most slightest way. Although DEP is a really great thing, it does the most to slow down your system. Initially in a freshly installed OS, you won’t even notice DEP’s influence, but as you install and add more files for your OS to monitor, that's when all hell breaks loose. Consider copying a file about the size of 500MB or more, when the OS is fresh, this should be nearly a piece of cake, but when your hard drive is filled up, you can take two cups of coffee before the process gets done, Phew! that's what happened when I had DEP enabled in Vista sometime ago. You can’t really blame DEP, it's doing good to you at the cost of speed, so I think I gave you enough info on this, let's get to the point of disabling them, oh and don't PANIC!! It's no big deal. Here is what you need to do.,,,, This is your system’s bootloader settings, don’t touch anything in their which you don’t know about.
 Bingo!! You found the roots of DEP, all you have to do is change the value “OptIn” to ” AlwaysOff ” (without quotes, ‘A’ and ‘O’ should be in capitals).
,,,,,,, Now restart the system.
 Personally I felt a great speed boost in Vista SP1 compared to the normal Vista installation. I would recommend you to disable DEP after you install Vista SP1 if you really have the need for speed .
 I wrote this post, because, DEP is somewhat old school to hackers and viruses. They learned to get past them, so DEP is just slowing things down for you, if you think keeping them enabled will save you from malicious codes. As for antivirus softies unlike DEP, they are not embedded to your OS, you can always turn them off with a simple click later, so they don’t pick on your operating system’s speed while your working.
