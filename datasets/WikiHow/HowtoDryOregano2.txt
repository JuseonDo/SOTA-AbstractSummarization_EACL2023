 This may take up a lot of space, but when you prepare oregano, the yield is much smaller than the initial hanging stalks.
 It takes plenty of time to completely dry oregano, but this method will bring out the full flavor of the oregano.



Separate the flowers from the leaves. When you prepare oregano for storage, you want to harvest the leaves and flowers separately.
Strip the leaves from the stalk by running your hand up and down the branch. It's best to have a clean counter space, because the dry oregano leaves will fall off in a pile.
Collect the leaves and crumple them up with your fingers to make them powdery.
Push the dry oregano onto a piece of paper, and use the paper as a funnel to pour the herb into airtight jars.
