@summary
choose a container for your secret belongings.

@summary
purify the container, bless and consecrate.

@summary
,

@summary
on the bottom of your container, as well as on the inner side of the lid, draw / paint / carve in the pentagram with the symbols of the elements.

@summary
design the seal.

@summary
come up with a protective spell which will maintain and constantly empower the seal.

@summary
if your spell includes asking certain spirits / deities for help, that means they'll most likely have to stick around our world in order to maintain the seal; so to prevent them from leaving and thus ruining all of this, make sure you seal the pact with them.

@summary
gather the items you wish to protect and cast a circle.

@summary
put the things you want protected in your container.

@summary
close the container so the drawn pentagrams on the bottom and lid match.

@summary
if you wish, you may recite your spell again, channeling more energy to the seal.
@article
 It can be as fancy or as simple as you wish. Anything from a shoebox to a wooden chest will work fine. Clean it up, and, if you wish, decorate it.;
,, Draw them in such a way that their positions will match once the container is closed.
 This part is extremely personal. Make sure the seal is something meaningful to you and that you can easily remember and visualize it.
 This, again, is very personal. Write it out on a piece of paper or fabric using any medium you wish (ink, paint, etc). Next to the spell, draw another pentagram. (Note: the spell in the picture is blurred to prevent misuse and plagiarism. Remember, spells are always more powerful when you write them yourself!).
 Do this by signing in the bottom of the paper / fabric and then leaving an imprint of your fingerprints next to the spell, in the same medium in which the spell is written. Leave the fingerprints of the hand by which you wrote the spell. In the middle, draw a circle to represent Aether and bind the pact.
 Recite your spell and then put the paper / fabric on which it's written in your container.
 Organize them any way you want.
 Place your palms on the top of the lid and recite your spell again. Imagine your seal black and spinning deosil as you recite, and then descending on the container. The moment it settles on the lid, its color will change. Do not try to dictate this, let the change in color come by itself. It's alright if the color it changes to is unexpected, just go with it.
 This will add more power to it.
