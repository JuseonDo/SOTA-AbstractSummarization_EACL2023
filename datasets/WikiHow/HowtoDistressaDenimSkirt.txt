get the skirt: you'll want it to be a little on the long side because you'll end up cutting a few inches off to make the bottom frayed.

@summary
try the skirt on: fold the hem up so it's as short as you want it to be.

@summary
cut the hem: using a ruler and a pair of scissors, cut the amount of inches off the hem that you measured out earlier.

@summary
fray the hem: pull all the little white threads out of the hem with your hands and with the metal file.

@summary
using the scissors, cut a small hole up near the pocket.

@summary
on the horizontally opposite side of your skirt, near the hem, try to pierce a hole through the skirt.

@summary
finished.

 You also don't want it to be to be too fitted or too baggyâ€“ but a little on the slim side is fine. It's great if it already has a wash to it, but make sure you'll do all the ripping yourself. It doesn't particularly matter what wash the denim is, but i prefer a light-medium wash;
, Sit down and measure the area you folded up in inches with a ruler, and write that number down on a piece of paper. Take the skirt off (it doesn't matter weather or not the hem stays folded.)

,, You can make the threads long or short- it doesn't matter.
 Stretch it out with your hands, and try to pull out all loose threads.
 YOU MUST HOLD THE FILE HORIZONTALLY. You'll see why in a second. You absolutely cannot use scissors to cut this hole. Using your file, stretch the hole bigger and bigger. Do not damage any of the threads by cutting vertically! Use the file to cut to the sides and also to pull the threads from the bottom and top of the hole out. when you get to your desired size, stop.
