 Ensure that the lipped edge faces upwards, as this will stop the glue from spilling over the edges.
 Add a decent amount, as the glue will form the background for this decorative item. Tilt the lid to let it fill across the whole lid space.
 Add a drop or two of food coloring or liquid watercolor in one corner of the glue. The coloring will immediately run a little, but that's okay. Stick to only one to two drops at most.

 Do not combine the colors too much, or else you'll just get a boring, murky brown. Swirl just enough to create a pretty design and leave it at that.
 The food coloring will continue to spread a bit, forming its own interesting pattern and shape. The drying will take at least a day and probably more likely two to three days. When the glue begins to peel away from the container lid, it is dry.
