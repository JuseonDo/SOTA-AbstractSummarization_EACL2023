 You can see both camshafts with distribution chain., This will be useful later to rotate the camshafts and thus find the quick link in the distribution chain., For this, place the piston at TDC. Take the workshop manual and look for the adjustment. Then take shim and compare with the data constructor. You can then deduct the value of blocks up., Attach the chain by string or wire, then remove the chain link and shift the chain to have free access to camshafts. (You can also just relax the chain on some models.),,,,, After, it returns the chain in place, making sure that the brand is facing. Stretch the chain., If not, check the valve adjustment again., After, get back fuel tank and plastics.
