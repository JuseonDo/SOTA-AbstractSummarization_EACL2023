 This is either the easiest or the hardest part, but it is crucial.;
,,, One method is to use the "Random Article" page on the left sidebar, although this may bring up extremely obscure pages. Another is to have an assigned person pick two pages, or to alternate between players. All players should then navigate to the starting page.
 Some rule sets allow the use of the back button and find function.



Note: It is usually acceptable to use the back button to get out of a page with no links in the article.
 It's interesting to follow the meandering (and at times bizarre) nature of wikilinks, and will prevent cheating. It is considered cheating to backspace pages, or use the "find on page" tool.
