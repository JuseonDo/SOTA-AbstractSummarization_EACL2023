@summary
if you have to create a poster, plan it out on a separate piece of paper first.

@summary
when creating the actual poster, use rulers and pencils for drawing rather than pen.

@summary
keep referring to the plan.

@summary
keep it colourful and laid out properly.

@article
 When you do this, you can edit things and move them around and add annotations and notes without having to worry about it looking messy.
 This way, you can rub out mistakes. If you need to have it or want to have it in fineliner, you can go over the original drawing later on.
 If need be, create several posters and choose the best. Then, write up a note sheet about the good and bad things of that poster.
