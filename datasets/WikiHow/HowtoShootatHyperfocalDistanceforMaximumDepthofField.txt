 It is the point at which you focus your lens to get the maximum depth of field. For example, if you are focused at 10 meters away, everything from the point halfway between you and where are focused (5 meters) to infinity will be sharp and in focus.;
, Your images will never be as sharp as you want without a tripod.
 Keeping the rule of thirds in mind is one way to ensure the success of your photograph.
,, If that is your max aperture, then back off just a bit to make sure your shot isn't affected adversely.
 You want to include as much of the landscape as you can.
 There is a formula that you can use for it.


Focal Length X Focal Length/(Circle of Confusion X Fstop)

Circle of confusion varies for what you are shooting

Digital SLR = 0.02
35mm format and digital SLR full-frame = 0.03
6x6cm format = 0.06
4x5in format = 0.15





, For a 50mm lens and a dSLR, it is (50 X 50)/(0.02 X 11).


2500/0.22 = 11363.63 = 11.36 meters (about 12.4 yards or approximately 37 feet).
 That will give you the best clarity and focus for your shot.
