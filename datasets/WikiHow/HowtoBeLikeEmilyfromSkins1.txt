in regards to hair, a bolder color is better.

@summary
if you cut your hair, the cut of the hair can be left to the discretion of your stylist- tell him or her that you want a sleek style, maybe with a bit of an edge.

 While Emily keeps a purplish red, other rich, expressive colors will do. Dark brown, black, bleach blond, or even deep blues and purples will work, as long as they are done with polish, are well suited to your skin tone, and are carried with confidence.;
, Emily's characteristic asymmetrical bangs are a start. Other options include a shaggy bob or even, if you're up for it, a bold pixie cut.


Bows, headbands, and cute clips are easily found in most stores and are usually cheap, so stock up- they are a key component in Emily's style.
