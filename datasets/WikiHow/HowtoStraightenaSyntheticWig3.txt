 If there are any windows open, be sure to close them. You want to trap as much steam as possible.
 How long it takes for the steam to appear will depend on how warm or cold the room was to begin with.
 Always start brushing from the ends first, and work your way up to the roots. The steam will heat the fibers up and cause the curls to loosen.
 Transfer the wig to a cool, dry place.
