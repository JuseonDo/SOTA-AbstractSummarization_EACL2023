 These movements are similar to those used by its natural predators. Instead, let the lizard see you from the side and slowly bring your hand below its belly.
 With small lizards, one hand is usually enough. Bring your hand beneath them, with your index finger arching up between their front legs and stopping just before their neck. With larger lizards like iguanas or monitors, you will need to support the lizard with two hands. Place one hand in the same position you would for a smaller lizard. Place your other hand on the lizard’s belly, with your wrist between its rear legs.
