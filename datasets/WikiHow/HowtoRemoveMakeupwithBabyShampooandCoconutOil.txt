The mild detergent found in baby shampoo is ideal for cutting through tough makeup and application without harming your skin. The coconut oil is soothing and even protects and softens delicate facial skin.;
, Tap water works just fine. However, if you want to go that extra step, fill with distilled or spring water.
 Make sure all the ingredients are well integrated.
 For easy application, have these pads on hand. In fact you can attach them to your bottle using a simple rubber band or elastic hair tie. It may not be pretty, but it's extremely functional and easy. If the cotton pad/ball is too big, use a cotton bud.
