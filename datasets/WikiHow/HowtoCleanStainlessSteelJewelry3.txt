 Also, make sure that the toothpaste does not contain any silica, or you will risk scratching your jewelry.
 Squeeze out any excess water. You want the cloth to be damp, and not soaking wet. Try to use a non-abrasive, lint-free cloth, such as microfiber.
 You do not need a lotâ€”less than a pea-sized amount will be more than enough. You can always apply more toothpaste later.
 Be sure to go with the grain, and not across it. If you rub the cloth across the grain, you will risk scratching it. Also, take care to avoid any gemstones set into your jewelry; many gemstones are very soft and can be easily scratched by toothpaste.
 Run the bristles under warm water, and apply more toothpaste if necessary. Gently scrub the toothpaste across the surface of the jewelry. Make sure that you are going with the grain, and not against it.Take care to avoid touching any gemstones.
 If needed, rinse the toothbrush with water, then use it to clean out any residual toothpaste out of nooks and crannies., This will prevent any water spots.If your jewelry has a lot of details in it, such as a brooch or necklace chain, gently wrap it up in the cloth and wait a few minutes before unwrapping it. This will give the soft cloth time to soak up any excess water.
 Make sure that the polish you use is labeled safe for stainless steel. Do not use silver polish, as it will leave stains. When polishing the jewelry, be sure to go with the grain, and not across it.
