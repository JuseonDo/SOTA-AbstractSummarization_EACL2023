 Find the highest speed at which you can comfortably run. This workout aims to increase your pace slowly, while either running or walking.


If you often compete in running races, use your pace from your last race as a good starting point.
 Stay at this pace for 5 minutes. You should feel more out of breath than usual.
 You can judge how many minutes you want to run according to time and endurance. Cool down by walking for 5 minutes between 3 and 4 mph (4.8 and 6.4 km/h).
