 Near the base, there is a tunnel and a significant slope up to the military base.;
, To get over the wall, you'll need a good car with a lot of speed.
 Drive fast and get over the wall.
 There is a jet in outside, about halfway down the runway.
 Fly out of there and stay low.
 When you are low, fly around the mountains until you have no stars.
, Enjoy a massive jet for future use!
