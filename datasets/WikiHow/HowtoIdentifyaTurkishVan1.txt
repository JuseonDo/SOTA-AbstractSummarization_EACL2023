 A Turkish Van has a white coat that is as soft as cashmere. In the summer, the cat’s hair sheds to become a short light coat. During the winter months, the Turkish Van’s soft white coat is thick and long., A Turkish Van has brown, red, gray, or black ears that are generally the same color as its tail. These markings contrast with the cat’s white coat. Sometimes a Turkish Van’s ears will have a striped pattern, while other times these marking will appear in a more solid pattern., You can tell whether a cat is a Turkish Van by carefully examining the animal’s tail. A Turkish Van has a full, brush-like tail. The tail will also be colored. For example, a Turkish van might have a brown, red, gray, or black tail that contrasts with its white coat., Without other distinctive, breed-specific characteristics, the presence of the mark alone does not necessarily mean a cat is a Turkish Van.
