 For the best effect, try different colors in different jars.
 If using different colors, add a few curls to each jar of water.
 Place the damp, colored sawdust on a newspaper so that the color doesn't spread. Let dry.
 It's a good idea to keep back some naturally colored sawdust curls to mix in with the colored curls, as this breaks up the color and makes for a more interesting effect.
