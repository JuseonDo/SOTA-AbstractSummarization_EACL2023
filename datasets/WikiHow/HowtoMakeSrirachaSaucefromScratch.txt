 Pulse until peppers are finely chopped. Scrape sides of the bowl as you mix to fully integrate ingredients.;
, Screw on lid tightly and allow jar to sit at room temperature. This is the fermentation process, which can take up to five days.


Check jar each day for fermentation. When mixture is fermenting you will see little bubbles form at the bottom of the jar.






Stir mixture each day and then replace the lid.






Allow sauce to ferment an additional 2 to 3 days until peppers are no longer expanding or rising.
 Pulse mixture until vinegar is integrated into sauce.


Puree for 1 to 3 minutes until sauce is completely smooth.
 Use rubber spatula to push sauce through the strainer--you want as much to strain through as possible.
 Set sauce to boil and then reduce heat to a simmer until sauce thickens. Sauce is ready when it clings to a spoon. This process could take from 5 to 10 minutes.
 Sauce can stay refrigerated up to 6 months.
