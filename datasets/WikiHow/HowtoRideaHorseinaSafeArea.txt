 Taking lessons at a riding school is a good way to learn to ride or to improve your technique. You will also meet other people who like riding. It's important to pick a good school, so get advice from someone knowledgeable. If you can find somewhere approved by a horse society, look around the school to see if it is a well-run school and what the lessons are like.;
, Riding out in the countryside is a really fun way to practise your horse riding skills, whether you go hacking, trekking or trail-riding. You can hacking from a riding school. Treks and trail rides are offered by trekking centres and horse ranches. Again, it's a good idea to get a recommendation.
 Make sure your horse is listening to your aids.
 but don't canter, even on the verge.
 Raise one hand or nod and smile.
 If you are turning left, take out your left arm. Same with the right. If turning right, hold out your right arm.
 Cars may also spook your horse, which causes it to run out the road and get injured by a car.
,, Avoid riding over crops and plants in a field, if you really need to go through the garden, ride near the fence. Be considerate. Pass people a walk, especially if they have kids. If you come across other animals, pass them at walk and don't disturb them wild or not. Shut any gates you open.
 Walk up to the gate, stopping with your horses shoulder against the latch. Reach down and open the gate being careful that it doesn't touch your horse. Ride through slowly, keeping one hand on the gate to stop it from swinging. Turn back, your horses neck should arch over the fence and close it gently.
