 uTorrent displays sponsored advertisements so that it can provide a free application without losing money. You can upgrade to uTorrent Ad-Free to both remove the ads and support the developer.
 Both versions provide an ad-free user experience but have some notable differences:


The Ad-Free upgrade costs $4.95 USD and is billed annually.
The Pro version costs $19.95 USD and also includes malware protection, technical support, file conversion tools, and the ability to stream torrents instantly.,


If you don’t see “Upgrade to Ad-Free” and you are using a Mac, try clicking the small X on the ad in the bottom left corner of the application.If you want to upgrade to uTorrent Pro, click “Upgrade to Pro” instead.
, If you’re using a Mac, uTorrent will automatically upgrade to the Ad-Free version. If you’re using Windows, exit uTorrent and then continue with this method.
 The file will end with “.exe” and be saved to your default download location.
 Once the installer has downloaded to your computer, double-click it to run the installation. Follow the prompts to replace the free version of uTorrent with your new paid, ad-free experience.
