 They should not be odorous and be completely dried out either from sunshine drying in the paddock or because you've purposefully strung them out to dry somewhere in the yard. Do not make this using liquid pats!;
,, The types of bags used for selling onions or oranges are ideal, provided they are large. Pack down well and fill it to the top.
 Put the lid on to discourage flies and other unwanted visitors.
 This will allow ample time for the manure to break down and be distributed through the water. During this time, dunk the bag up and down gently regularly to help distribute the contents as they break down.
 Once the three weeks have passed, use the liquid fertiliser on your plants. It must be diluted first - the dilution should be nine parts water to one part liquid manure. This fertiliser is suitable for most plants, even seedlings, provided it is diluted.
