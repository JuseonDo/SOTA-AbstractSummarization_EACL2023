 These are: a shoebox lid, sand or soil, water, a small container to hold the water (a small tea light candle holder is a good choice), pebbles or small rocks, a bridge, fake or real moss, a comb or mini rake, and any additional items you'd like to add, just remembering that simplicity is important for a Zen garden.;
