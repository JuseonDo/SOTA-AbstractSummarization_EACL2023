 A plant-based detergent or one based on castile soap are ideal.
 Instead, wash the cutlery's metallic end and try to avoid placing the handle join into the water. The reason for this is that many pearl cutlery joins use water-based glue and the glue will weaken in the water, causing it to split and crack.
 Dry immediately using a soft cloth. Towelling tea towels are the best.
