Random - 0.020: Gives it a bit of an irregular look.

Be sure you have the star selected and not the pentagon shape. Otherwise, it just won't look right.
 This will give you a right leaning star.
, Click on Object >> Fill and Stroke. This will bring up the dialog box.
 This will bring up several more tabs. Click on the wheel tab from there. You can choose any color that you like and for the stroke; make it 6 pixels.


If you have a certain color that you would like to use, just insert the hex code into the box below the wheel.

Note that the basic star shape is complete. Now, you will be giving your star some character.
 It will have the same coloring as you had before. That's OK, because you will be changing that.
 You will use a gradient fill for the Fill.






Click on the linear gradient fill (third icon from the left) and then click the 'Edit' button.

Inkscape uses 'stops' to allow you to control the gradient. You can add as many as you like and make a more complicated gradient if wished. This will only require the 2 default stops.




Set stop 1 to RGBA fafafaff and stop 2 to RGBA ddddddff. The two colors are pretty close and it may not look like there is a difference until you are finished.
If the dialog box doesn't come up immediately, double click on the eye (the outer perimeter) until it does.
 You will want to make it appear like your star is looking at an angle. Try about 120 degrees. It is easiest to think of it one of these two ways:


About the angle of 4:30 or so or break up a circle into segments.

360 - Circle
180 - Semi-circle
90 - Quarter circle

120 is halfway between the two





, You will want to have it 'looking up' at the same angle as the gradient.
 Give it an angle with the Selector tool. Click on it again to allow you to rotate it.


If you can't seem to get them both selected together, hold down SHIFT while selecting.
 While both are selected, duplicate the eye (unless you have a pirate star!).
