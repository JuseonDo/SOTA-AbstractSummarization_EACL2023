think of something school appropriate because some schools may see pjs as too casual.

@summary
pair them with just about anything; it's better to tone down the top when wearing pj's, especially if they haven't become a trend in your school yet.

@summary
make sure you look good.

@summary
don't over-do it.

@summary
make sure you are confined in them so you don't have embarrassing incidents.

 Running out in some waist high, baggy butt, fruit print PJ bottoms isn't a smart choice. It's best to keep the pattern and colors somewhat neutral. Plaid is especially good. Be sure they are not too baggy or too tight: try to find something in the middle that's comfortable and cute.;
, Stick with slimmer tops to balance out your shape. Avoid pairing them with over-size hoodies, unless you want to look like a bum.
 (Here's a suggestion: If your pajama pants are saggy, some type of skate shoes looks better with them)

, Getting up out of bed and just heading to school in what you're wearing is a big no-no. Take time to get rid of that bedhead and change into a nice drool-free shirt. Pairing PJ bottoms with slippers overdoes it a little as well. Sneakers can often look a little strange paired with PJ pants, but Ugg's slippers or boots look good with PJ pants. (Here's a suggestion: Tuck PJ pants into Ugg boots and it will look really cute!)

, Like during p.e. and always make sure they stay on you.
