 You can use a compass or trace a round object or circular template to get a clean circle.;
, The light source in this example is on the upper left, somewhat in front of the page (or behind the viewer).
 Start opposite the light source and move inwards. The darkest area will be furthest from the light source. Create circles or partial circles of equal value (darkness).
