 For example, you are playing on the A string. Part of the song goes like this: B B Bf Bf C C Cs Cs D and A strings; the notes with flats look like this: f. You'll also notices that the sharps will look like this: s.
 Put your index finger down on the A string.

This is the A string and B fingering: _________________B_ X.
 Slide your first finger down so that it almost touches the little bump at the end of the strings.

B Flat fingering: _________________B|Bf| X.
 Go back to B, and slide your finger up. (Half-step.)

C fingering: _________________C|B|Bf| X.
 Here it is C sharp. Half-step up and that's it! {Cs Cs}.

C Sharp Fingering: ____________Cs|C|B|Bf| X.
