handguns take skill and practice to use.

for first time handgun owners, revolvers are probably the better choice as they are simpler.

for more experienced users, or users willing to take a formal instruction, a semi-automatic handgun may make more sense due to their increased capacity and easier follow-up shots.

every person is different.

when hunting, a larger caliber may be required as many dangerous game have tough skin and muscles the need the extra energy to penetrate through skin and muscle to reach vital organs.

 If you are not willing to devote time and effort to learn the skills, don't endanger others by trying to use one under stress. Handgun marksmanship is considered a sport because it takes training and skill.
 Typically they hold 5-6 rounds which is enough so that you will not have to reload during most home defense incidents.
 Operation takes a bit more learning and practice, but the positives are why the majority of law enforcement and military personnel carry semi-automatic handguns.
 A firearm that "fits" my hand perfectly will not feel right to you. Most firearm owners are happy to allow a novice to try a couple of shots. Do your research, test fire a few weapons before you invest.
 Many lower-power cartridges may not penetrate deeply enough to cause incapacitating damage.
