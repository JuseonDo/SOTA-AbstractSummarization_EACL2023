Make sure the recycling bins are abundant and clearly marked. Place them in several areas in the office that are logical to the types of materials you are recycling. For example, put a paper recycling bin in the mail room and an aluminum can receptacle in the cafeteria and break room.



Let those who are truly invested help keep the program running, giving those who wish to participate an active role. The simpler it is for some, the more likely they will continue to participate.



Management can easily purchase energy efficient light bulbs, low-flow toilets and recycled paper as a few examples. These small changes can also have a big impact on the company's bottom-line.
