 You can only bruise 1-2 pods at a time. You will be using the flat side of a knife, lightly cracking open the pods like you might crush garlic.;
, You simply want to use a large, broad knife to provide consistent, even pressure to the pod, cracking it open. Do not crush too hard, or the seeds will fall out. Simply apply pressure slowly until you hear a crunch., You'll notice that the seeds inside should just be visible at this point. In good cardamom, they will be dark brown or black, much like coffee beans. If they are not, discard them.
 Many recipes call for cardamom to slow cook with the meal, and you can then remove the cardamom when you serve. It is an aromatic, imparting a light flavor on dish, but it can be quickly overpowering if you bite into one unknowingly.
