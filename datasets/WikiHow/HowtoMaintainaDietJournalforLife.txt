 You could also buy a cover for the steno-pad which has pockets but this is optional. Using a word processing program such as Microsoft's Word is a great way to organize your diet journal electronically. Save your work by month and year in separate folders to your hard drive.;
, for the entire week. Leave a line open after Saturday, then start again with Sunday. Put the day of the month beside each day of the week. There should be two columns of days, Sunday through Saturday.
,, Start with day one of journal (next page). If you're on the Weight Watcher'sâ„¢ program, also add the highly recommended points.
, Don't forget to also add what kind of exercise you did and for how long, and anything else about your day that is relevant.
 just divide the page into 4 equal sections with pen and use smaller writing. This helps you get an overview of your progress. Alternatively, you can choose to have one page devoted per diet day if you want, so you can make more entries, (e.g., emotions, exercise etc.).
 On your main calendar page, total up the total number of calories/kilojoules/points at the end of the week. Also record your weight. Once you get a whole book filled, you will see how many calories/points it takes to maintain a certain weight, and you can see the weeks where you have lost or gained weight. You may also learn the triggers that cause you to eat more or less food.
