@summary
measure the width of the transparent object.

@summary
send light from a point light source through the object.

@summary
aim the point light source into the object at an angle.

 For example, a pane of window glass has a thickness that may be stated by the manufacturer, but which should be measured to ensure accurate calculation of the refractive index.;
, Monochromatic point light sources are available through laboratory supply outlets. Place the point light source a known distance from the surface of the object. Aim the point light source into the object perpendicularly to the point on the object being struck. Mark the other side of the object at the point where the light emerges.
 Move the light source such that a line drawn between the perpendicular placing of the light source and the angled placing of the light source forms a right angle. Note the point where the light emerges on the other side of the object. Mark that point where the light emerges.
