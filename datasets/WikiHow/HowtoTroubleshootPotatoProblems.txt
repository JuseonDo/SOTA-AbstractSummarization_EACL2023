 If you find black patches on the leaves of your potatoes, suspect blight. This should be sprayed with copper at the first sign.;
, If they're turning green, they're exposed to sunlight. Once they're green, they're toxic and no longer edible. Cover up with more soil to prevent this from occurring to remaining potatoes. And check that Fido isn't causing a problem; you might need to keep your dog away from the veggie patch.
 Soil nematodes can be a problem for potatoes. If you find them in your potato crop, shift the crop around to another part of the garden. Another alternative is to plant the potatoes in fresh potting mix in the bag and to plant the entire bag in the ground.
 Not only will they turn green as mentioned in an earlier step, but the risk of the tuber moth increase when potatoes are exposed at the surface.
