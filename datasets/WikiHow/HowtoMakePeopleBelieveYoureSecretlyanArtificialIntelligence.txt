 You're a computer. But what's your purpose? Why are you in a human body? Be adventurous. Keep a mental note of everything you think of.;
,, If you feel you can't answer it, say in a flat voice: "I am sorry, I do not understand." (make sure you don't sound cheeky though)

,, This takes practice, but it's really effective.
 It can be about anything you want, for example, if you like a type of sport, you can research random facts about it.
 Do this for an hour and see if they notice. If they do, they're most likely to ask "Are you alright?" or "Why are you talking like that?" Return to your own voice and say "What are you talking about?"

,, If you're not the kind of person who wants to bother with all that hassle or look like a nerd, then just try a bit harder than you usually do.
 It doesn't have to be computers themselves, although that WOULD be the best one to choose.
 GLaDOS from the Portal Series, HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Mr Smith from The Sarah Jane Adventures are three great examples to start with. Listen to the way they talk, the words they use, etc.
 Many AI's in fiction like to make a witty joke or use sarcasm in an attempt to fit in with the human universe.
