,,, Use color, and make the cover your own.
 You can also make a template on a computer, or find one online and print it out. It can also be interesting, however, to draw your boxes freehand. This will give you a different effect.
 This will most probably be a one shot or single chapter, regarding this being a "Quick Comic Book" Make sure your script or story is properly edited, refined and rewritten if need be.
 Your draft should be rough, and on scratch paper if possible. You won't even be drawing hands and feet. Just a framework of the character, lines and circles. Rough in the speech bubbles, but without the speech written in.
 If you are keeping the whole thing traditional and on paper, draw all of it, with the speech bubbles after, still in pencil and ink all of it in with a permanent media. If you're uploading it online or scanning it, create all the art, without any inkling of speech bubbles and ink it in. Scan it and add the speech bubbles on your photo editing program like GIMP or Photoshop

, Remember that every comic style has its own coloring style. Color according to that.
