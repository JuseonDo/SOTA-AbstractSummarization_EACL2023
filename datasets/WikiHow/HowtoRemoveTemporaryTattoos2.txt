 Clear tape, such as Scotch tape, works better than masking or painterâ€™s tape. Hang the tape pieces by one end off of the side of a table or counter (wherever you will be working).
 Make sure that you press it down firmly so that it attaches to the surface of the temporary tattoo. Use a finger to rub the tape down along your skin.
 The temporary tattoo should peel off with the tape. This process might take several tries, particularly if it is a large temporary tattoo.
 Do this after all of the temporary tattoo has been removed. Doing this will reduce the redness caused by peeling the tape from your skin.
