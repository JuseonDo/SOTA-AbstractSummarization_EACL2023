@summary
invest in an inexpensive stove-top espresso maker, namely, the "macchinetta".

@summary
take a quick look at the machinetta.

@summary
note that in most macchinettas, the top chamber, central column and filter plate are combined in one piece, the funnel filter is a separate piece, and the steam release valve and bottom chamber are combined in one piece.

@summary
,

@summary
use excellent quality coffee grounds.

@summary
fill the bottom chamber up to the steam release valve with cold water.

@summary
,

@summary
insert the funnel filter.

@summary
once the water is at the appropriate level and the funnel filter has been inserted, fill the funnel with your coffee grounds.

@summary
take the upper part of the machinetta and turn it upside down and inspect the filter and gasket.

@summary
place the macchinetta on the stove top.

@summary
wait.

@summary
allow the process to complete.

 Proper hardware is a must to brew a great cup of coffee.;
, Macchinettas are composed of 6 parts:


Top Chamber
Central Column
Filter Plate
Funnel Filter
Steam Release Valve
Bottom Chamber

,, To be specific, only use coffee grounds specifically labeled as "espresso ground coffee". Ask at your coffee specialist store for good recommendations.
, If the water starts to fill the funnel filter area, you will need to remove some water. You want the water to almost start to fill the filter but not actually start. This might take you a couple of turns.
 Regardless of what size machinetta you are using, you will want to fill the funnel so that the coffee grounds form a nice dome. You will know you have the right amount when you cannot add any more without some spilling off. Do not tamp or compact the grounds.
 If there are any obstructions or old grounds, clear them out. After verifying that the upper part is okay, turn it back over and screw it on to the bottom of the macchinetta. Ensure you have a good seal. If you do not screw it on tightly enough, you will end up with a big mess, and if you screw it on too tightly, it will be very hard to take the macchinetta apart to clean.
 When applying heat, the hotter the stove the more bitter the Italian caffe will be. Try to find an acceptable compromise between too hot and cooler and too slow.
 As the water in the bottom chamber begins to boil the water passes through the grounds, up the central column, and into the upper chamber. When the water in the bottom chamber is close to being completely transferred to the upper chamber you will start to hear a gurgling sound. Wait 15 seconds after you first hear the gurgling noise and then remove the machinetta from the heat.
 The Italian caffe will continue to percolate for up to 30 seconds. After this you should have an outstanding batch of coffee!
