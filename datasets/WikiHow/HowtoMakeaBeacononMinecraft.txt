 You will need 5 glass blocks, 3 obsidian blocks, and 1 nether star.;
,, The 3 obsidian blocks fill the lowest layer, the nether star goes in the middle and the glass blocks go in the leftover slots.
, The beacon should be the top block.


The higher the pyramid, the more status effects you can choose from and the further the effects can go.
The kind of block you use doesn't affect the beacon, you can even mix iron, gold, diamond and emerald blocks.
 This will open up the GUI, where you can activate the beacon.
 You can choose from an iron or gold ingot, an emerald or a diamond.


Again, it doesn't matter which one you choose.
 On the left you can choose one of the effects as your primary power. If your pyramid is high enough, you can choose a secondary power on the right.


Be very careful when choosing the status effects, as you will have to pay another material to change them.
