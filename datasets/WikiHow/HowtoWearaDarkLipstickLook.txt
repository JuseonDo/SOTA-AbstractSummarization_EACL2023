 You want them to look soft, since the dark colour of the lips will anyway stand out.;
, If you have a lot of veins showing, before applying the eyeshadow, put a dab of concealer and blend well. Blend the eyeshadow too.
 Blend well.
 Do it in a zig-zag motion to prevent any uneven application. After covering the end of the lashes, apply some on the roots too.For this look, do not apply mascara under the eyes, because your eyes should look soft and unnoticed.
 Blend it so it can get in the skin. Apply acne creams if needed.
 Just BB or CC creams will not be enough. Put a dot on your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. Smudge and blend it with a makeup brush.
 Make sure not too apply too much. Try not to cake it.
 That insures that the concealer won't get into the fine lines.
 Make a fish face, and apply the contour on the cheekbone. You can put some on the sides of the forehead too. Just remember, you must blend well.
 Use a concealer brush to perfect the area of your lips.
, A dark lipstick can be a dark berry, a plum, or anything on the dark side. Experiment so that you can see what works best.


For the best effect, use a lip brush to perfectly fill in the lips.
 Only apply three layers or less. More will make your lips look unnaturally shiny.
