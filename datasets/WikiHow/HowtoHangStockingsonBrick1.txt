 Aim for the mortar between the bricks, not the brick.;
, Many cup hangers come with a screw end on them, just ask for these at the hardware store. When you finish screwing it in, ensure that hanger is positioned so that the hook is facing upward.
 Most stockings have some sort of a loop on them. If your stocking doesn't, make your own using either ribbon and glue or stitch a loop in place.
 Done. The stocking will now stay firmly on the brick fireplace.
