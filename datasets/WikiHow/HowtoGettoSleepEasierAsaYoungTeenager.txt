, Sleeping on a really comfy pillow will ensure that you are getting the most comfort in your sleep. You'll need to find a pillow that suits you, whether it is hard or soft. Some people prefer sleeping without pillows. Consider getting a memory foam pillow if you have problems with your neck.
 Some teenagers like sleeping with a little bit of light, a few like sleeping in pitch black. Experiment over the weekend and test whether you sleep better with light or better in the dark. Remember to consider other people's needs, if you share a room.
 Make a playlist of "chill" songs and listen to it, at a low volume. Listen to the same music every night before you go to sleep and only listen to this music at that time. Your brain will soon recognise it as sleeping music and you will feel drowsy once you hear it.
 You can think or things that you'd like to do in ten years time or maybe create a story in your head, it is proven that people sleep better when they go into a deep thought. Don't start thinking about serious problems!

, However, you will not sleep if you're thinking too much. Write down your problems and concerns in a notebook and place it a drawer. This will make our mind feel as if the problems can be safely be put aside for the night so you can get your sleep. In the morning, look over the problems. Things always seem more achievable after a good night's sleep!

, Perhaps try to cover them using some sticky notes, so you don't have to completely take them out of your room.
, Keep moving(you will keep moving unconsciously), otherwise your body will feel stiff in the morning.
 Work out what you find most comfortable and use it.
