 Confidence can not be forced out of your child. Be patient and supportive throughout as experts agree this plays a vital role in child development.;
, Public speaking may seem daunting at first, but the only way to get rid of stage fright is by mustering up the courage to get up there.
 Let your child know that he/she has worth and is important. Keep reminding them how awesome they are.
 Show your child what good values are.
 Reward and congratulate your child when they do something good. The greater the achievement, the greater the reward should be.
 Don't press your child too hard or put their nose to the grindstone.
 It is very important not to criticize your child for any flaws they are already aware of, as this will only lead to them being more nervous.
, If your child knows you worry about them actively, it will only make them less confident.
