 Here is where, if you chose to use a used baseball, you may want to clean it up first!
,


First, you have to remove the threading. You can just pull it out using tweezers and scissors.
Once the threading is removed, you can just peel the skin off of the ball. The leather skin will come off in 2 pieces as shown.
 Here, you are going to take the bead you chose to use as a clasp and string the elastic cord through it. Now, tie a knot around it, you want it to be kind of tight, to secure it in place., At this point your needle will be on the outside (white side) of the baseball skin., Tie and secure the thread around the elastic cord so your bead stays in place., You want your loop to be small enough for the piece you chose as the clasp to not be able to fall through without stretching the cord., At this point your needle will be on the outside (white side) of the baseball skin.,, Cut a piece of the felt you picked out into the same size and shape as the piece of leather skin.,, Sew in the new thread using the same holes that the original baseball thread made in the leather by:


First, going through the felt and the original hole
Next, bring the thread around the outside of the bracelet to and back up through the next hole. That way it still resembles the original baseball threading.
You will continue this until you have gone all the way around the bracelet, then tie to secure the thread.
 All you have left to do now is to decorate it, or if you choose not to, it looks cute without any decorations as well! Here, a couple Detroit old English D’s were drawn in permanent marker on this one and then jewel embellishments were used to outline the bracelet.
