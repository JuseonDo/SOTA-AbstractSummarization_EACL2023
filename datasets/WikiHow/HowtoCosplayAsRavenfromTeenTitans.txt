Don't let your emotions show, but do come to terms with them and release them safely. Avoid being excited. It is okay to crack a smile occasionally, and if you need to, cry, but as little as possible.
*Be as smart as you are.
Protect the ones you care about.
Don't open so much about yourself. Only trust your closest friends."
, Make ironic remarks about various subject.
*Don't be amused when you are in an amusement park.
*Be more mature than a typical person.

*Meditate. This is a great way to keep your emotions under control, and think about important things. Keep your room private! Make sure your room is dark and has lots of books. Also drink herbal tea to relax.
 When you go outside, wear sunblock.
*Keep your hair down. Don't pull it up.
* Raven's look is natural. Bright colors are a definite no. If you have to wear makeup, use a black liquid or gel eyeliner on your top lash line, and only a little on your bottom lashes to open up your eyes.
*Wear long clothes when possible.
*Wear dark, mysterious clothing.
 Your "friends" should be able to come to you for anything.
, While extroverts are primarily concerned with what's going on outside themselves, introverts are often preoccupied with their inner world. One way to shift focus is by keeping a journal; commit to a daily writing practice. Along with meditation, journaling is another way to keep emotions in check.
 If you do have anything to say, think about what you're saying to avoid making further embarrassment and stupidity of yourself.
 For example, you might let everyone know you don't like reading, but you might only let it slip out every now and then that you're deathly afraid of speaking in public.
 Don't stop talking altogether though.
 Don't skip rope or go play football or something like that. If you're going swimming or ice skating, simply go around just floating or looking about. Playing on rafts or using a bar to skate aren't very clever ways to make people think you're all that mysterious.
