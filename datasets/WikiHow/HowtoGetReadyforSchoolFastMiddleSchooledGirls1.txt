 If you wear makeup, put it on your dresser, your nightstand or in the bathroom so you know where to find it if you need it.;
,, A good choice is peanut butter and jelly, because it can be stored in the freezer, taken out in the morning and thawed by lunch. If you'll buy lunch at school, grab some lunch money and put it in your backpack.
 When you do this again in the morning it won't be so tangled. If you don't want to take shower in the morning or if want to take a bath, now is the time! If you do it the night before, you can also shave if you need to.

 Get in your pajamas, get in bed, make sure your clock is set and get ready for a new day by getting a good night's rest.
