 Some types of orchid fare better outside than others.


Do an Internet search for "distribution of orchid species." If a species is listed for your part of the world, the flowers should be able to grow outside.;
,, You have to gradually acclimate orchids to the greater intensity and amount of light outdoors. As time passes, move the orchids to areas with less shade.


Set aside a place for your orchids to grow where they will be shielded from the sun part of the time. Place the orchids under a shade cloth that allows you to expose the orchids to sunlight some of the time. Or place the orchids in pots on benches under trees.
