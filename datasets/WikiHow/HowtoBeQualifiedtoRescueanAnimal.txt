 There are a lot of things to consider.


You should have everyone involved. It's not all about you. If you are in a family or group living situation, you have others to consider.
What preferences do you have for a rescue, if any? Do some research. Some 'specialties' are: Senior, chronically ill, disabled, black, breed, etc.;
, Most rescues will greatly appreciate any help with fostering animals. This will give you an idea of the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds that you may encounter with a rescued dog.
 You can get to know the type of dog without the commitment that taking one home with you takes.
 Print it out in black or white (or write it down).
, Be advised that some rescues will require you to take training classes.
 This isn't just doing a feel good project and forgetting it. The ideal is a permanent home for your pet.
 That can help you a bit with understanding behaviors, such as your spotted dog that wants to herd everyone, including yourself!

, The rescue, if large enough, might help you with the costs, or it may not.
