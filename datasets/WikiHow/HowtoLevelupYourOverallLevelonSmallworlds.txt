 Click Party Poppers (if you're level 1);
, You can garden these, or buy them with your coins/tokens. Make 24 Party Poppers. Or more/less as much as you need to reach level 3.
 You will need them to make Cream Pies. You need at least 3x Azure Trumpets so buy Azure Trumpets from the store with tokens or gold.
 These are much more expensive so you have the same options. Buy Alien Coralite. Pay up or garden em'! You will need them until level 7 crafting.
 Good. Because now we are crafting Magical Egyptian Relics. Azure Trumpets are still needed so stock up on those. You will need to do this until level 10 crafting.
 While your stocking up White Buttertrees and you got 100 you could (optional) make snowballs as well! It's a good idea if you want tokens too. Hopefully you still have cream pie if you want to make snowballs.
 Make Fish Head Scrolls. Alien Coralites and White Butter-trees are needed.
