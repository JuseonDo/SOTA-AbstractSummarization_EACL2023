 The paper cup, when unwrapped and placed flat, can help keep any crumbs from spilling elsewhere.;
, You can eat them as is, but they are great for dipping in icing or coffee as well.


Note that picking apart the muffin with your fingers will create crumbs, making this method less than ideal if you are trying to be clean, or are eating in a public space such as the car or subway.
Muffins that contain larger fruit such as blueberries often lend themselves very well to piece picking, as the blueberries often can be removed from the muffin in natural chunks.
 Pick up the base and eat it like a piece of fruit.
 These smaller pieces of the base are great for dipping into coffee and icing, or holding small spreads of jam or butter.
