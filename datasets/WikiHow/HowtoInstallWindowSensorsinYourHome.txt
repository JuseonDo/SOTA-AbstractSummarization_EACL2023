 Buy one sensor for each, after confirming that a particular kind of sensor is compatible with your burglar alarm system.


You don't need to cover all your windows. Windows that are plainly visible from the street, and windows up off the ground floor, usually don't need a sensor. Neither do windows that are too small for a burglar to fit through. Windows that are stuck or painted shut may need coverage, since a burglar can choose to break that window.;
, Different brands and models install in different ways. If the manual conflicts with anything you read here, defer to the manufacturer's instructions.
 Corners are good places to mount sensors, because they obscure less of your view.
 Run the wire to your control panel, either along a corner of your wall or through the wall if you are able. The connection wire usually comes with a window sensor kit. If not, you can buy it at any electronics store or home improvement center.


Repeat this step for each of the sensors that you want to install.
 Plug the end of the connection wires into the input points.
 If you have a live-response service with your home security system, it's a good idea to call ahead and let them know you'll be doing this.
