 Most cruise lines have a wide variety of activities to do and food to eat, so don't be afraid that you will be bored on board.;
,, When you are hundreds of miles out at sea, why not go karaoke with the cruise fun director, sit in on auctions or play the games in the auditorium. You never know when you might be the winner and go back to your cabin with a fabulous prize.
 Most cruise lines seat you with other people at the larger, formal dinners. So don't be shy, and chat up your new acquaintances.
 Some boats even have non-smoking night clubs, which can make the evening much more enjoyable for non-smokers.
 Enjoy the wide variety of food that your service provider has to offer.
 Most cruises are able to get at least a few channels on the television, and some even run movies on the TV. So take a break from the hustle and bustle and relax in your room.
 Taking a cruise should be all about the experience, so be sure and sign up with at least one tour group for each port of call to see how the natives live or to gain easier access to hot tourist locations.
 Bring snacks, a deck of cards, a book, or anything else that is going allow you to enjoy passing the time on the water.
 From dolphins to whales in the ocean, to fowl or other animals viewable along coastal areas, enjoy the sights of nature as you spend time on your vessel.
