 If people can't stand your smell, you won't be that popular.

Take lots of showers, and brush your teeth well. If you struggle with bad breath, use some breath mints.

, You have to be a notch up from civil, even to people you really don't like. Try to forget why anyone would ever be mean. Do good deeds once in a while, like charity walk-a-thons. People will definitely respect you for it! Plus, it develops inner beauty, which can help with the whole sweetness thing.
 Appearances are, unfortunately, the first thing people notice about you. Looking cute will get you more friends.
 Just because you're not a gutter girl doesn't mean you have to be a brain dead ditz. Make your mom & dad proud.
 Some ideal places are to shop are Limited Too and Macy's. Hollister, Abercrombie, A&F, PacSun, Forever21, and American Eagle will also work fine. Here are some basics to get you started: pink and baby blue shirts, sequins, pastels, "school girl" outfits, low skinny heels, camis, cashmere, skirts, and feminine designer purses.
 Genuinely develop this kind of attitude. Don't watch violent or sex-obsessed TV shows and improve your reading. Be careful online too

, Speak kindly, and try not to raise your voice. Be sweet and kind, if anyone swears or says inappropriate things, pretend you don't understand. Or just pretend you didn't hear and say, "What? I didn't hear you."

, Posture is a VERY important part of the "innocent attitude." Plus, no one likes a sloucher.
 Be sad somewhere that they would stoop that low. Don't chew them out, though.
 Try to find the good in all situations.
