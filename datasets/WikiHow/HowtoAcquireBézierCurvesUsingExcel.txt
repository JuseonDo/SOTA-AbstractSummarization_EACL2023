Given Points P0 and P1, a linear Bézier curve is simply a straight line between those two Points.

Your chart should now resemble this one, except that I did Copy Picture including the data section and did Paste Picture onto the 'Saves' worksheet, then copied that and opened it in Preview in order to save it as a jpg file:







,
B(t) = (1-t)*+ t*, where t is an element in the range , inclusive, which can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points in the linear Bézier curves from P0 to P1 and from P1 to P2 respectively.
Rearranging the preceding equation algebraically gives:
B(t) = (1-t)^2*P0 + 2*(1-t)*t*P1 + t^2 * P2, where t is an element in the range , inclusive.
The derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to t is
B´(t) = 2*(1-t)*(P1 - P0) + 2*t*(P2 - P1), from which it can be concluded that the tangents to the curve at P0 and P2 intersect at P1.
As t increases from 0 to 1, the curve departs from P0 in the direction of P1, then bends to arrive at P2 from the direction of P1.
The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to t is:
B´´(t) = 2*(P2 - 2*P1 + P0].
A quadratic Bézier curve is also a parabolic segment. As a parabola is a conic sector, some sources refer to quadratic Béziers as "conic arcs".
Enter the sub headers and formulas which create the chart:

Enter t to cell A34; enter X P0 to cell B34; enter Y P0 to cell C34; enter X P1 to cell D34; enter Y P1 to cell E39; enter X P2 to cell F34; enter Y P2 to cell G34; enter ((1-t)^2+(1-t)t*P1+t^2* P2)*Interpolater to cell K39 and also to cell L39;

Drag the chart so that its upper left corner is in cell M19 and resize it so its lower right corner is in cell Q31.
Except for some Data Marker Styles and Fill and perhaps a few other details, your chart should resemble this one:






,
The curve starts at P0 going toward P1 and arrives at P3 coming from the direction of P2. Usually, it will not pass through P1 or P2; these points being there only to provide directional information.
The distance between P0 and P1 determines "how long" the curve moves into direction P2 before turning towards P3.
Writing BPiPjPk(t) for the quadratic Bézier curve defined by points Pi, Pj and Pk, the cubic Bézier curve can be defined as a linear combination of two quadratic Bézier curves.
B(t) = (1-t)*BP0,P1,P2(t) + t*BP1,P2,P3(t), with t as an element in the range , inclusive.
For some choices of P1 and P2, the curve may intersect itself, or contain a cusp.
Any series of 4 distinct points can be converted to a cubic Bézier curve that goes through all 4 points in order.
Given the starting and ending point of some cubic Bézier curve, and the points along the curve corresponding to t = 1/3 and t = 2/3, the control points for the original Bézier curve can be recovered.
The derivative of the cubic Bézier curve with respect to t is
B´(t) = 3*(1-t)^2 * + 6*(1-t)*t*(P2 - P1) + 3*t^2 *(P3 - P2).
The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to t is:
B´´(t) = 6*(1-t)*(P2 - 2*P1 + P0) + 6*t*(P3 - 2*P2 + P1).
