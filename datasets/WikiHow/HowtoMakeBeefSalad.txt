 Mix it well, until the sugar is dissolved. You can adjust the taste by adding more sugar, or fish sauce. Set aside.;
, Grill the steak, about 4 minutes on each side, until it would be 'medium'. DO NOT overcook the meat, or it could turn out tough.
 Slice it into thin strips. Add the sliced meat, and any of it's juices to the bowl of sauce. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours for best flavor.
 Top the lettuce with the diced cucumber, then pour the meat and sauce over it.
