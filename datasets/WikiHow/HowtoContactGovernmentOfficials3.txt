Ask if there is any information you need to bring with you. For example, if you are planning to attend a school board meeting or schedule a meeting with your local assembly person, you might want to bring supporting materials or evidence that will help you make a point or ask for help.
 If you do not have an appointment, politely ask if the government official has a moment to meet with you.
