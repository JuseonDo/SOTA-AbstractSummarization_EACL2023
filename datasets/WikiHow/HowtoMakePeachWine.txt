 Wash the peaches to remove any debris and dirt from them.;
, There is no need to worry about removing the skin. Place the peach slices into the plastic container.
 Add the acid blend, tannin and the Campden tablet (if using) and mix through.
 Leave to stand for 24 hours. This now turns into the "must".
 Mix the wine yeast and yeast nutrient with the tepid orange juice. Cover and shake well. Put it aside for one to three hours, until it becomes bubbly. Add the bubbly yeast mixture to the must.
 Leave to ferment for three days.
 Pour the wine through a strainer into another clean container. Use the strainer to remove the solids (peach flesh, skin, etc.).
 Remove once boiled and leave to cool. Pour the cooled sugar water to the strained wine liquid. Add enough to make up one gallon., If the bubbling calms down sooner, then the wine may be ready sooner than ten days.
 Allow the wine to ferment to completion.
 Cellar it for a minimum of three months before trying it.
