 This is very important. Concrete is caustic, and it can cause burns if it gets onto your skin. Make sure that the gloves are waterproof.
 For every 80-pounds (36.3-kilo) of concrete, you will need 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of water.
 If you want to color your concrete, pour the liquid cement color into the water, and give it a stir.
 Keep your face away from the mixer, so that the dust doesn't get onto your skin. It might be a good idea to wear a dust mask of some sort for this part.
 As you continue to add water, the concrete will get softer and mushier.
 Once the concrete is done mixing, dump it into a wheelbarrow while the mixer is still running.If you need to add more water, do so sparingly.
 Put your glove on, and give the concrete a squeeze. The concrete should feel like wet oatmeal and hold its shape.
