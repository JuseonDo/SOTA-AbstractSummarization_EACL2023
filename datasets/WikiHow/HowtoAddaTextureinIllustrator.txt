 There are many free textures available by simply searching "illustrator texture." Commonly used textures include wood grain, mosaic, patchwork, stained glass and craquelure texture, which is similar to a patina on plaster. Choose a texture image that is light in color and save it on your computer.;

, Select "Transparency" from the drop-down menu. A palette should open up to the right of your document. You should also see a drop down menu for blending and a drop down menu for opacity.
 Choose "Show Thumbnails."

 Select the "File" drop down menu on your top horizontal toolbar.
 A browser box will open. Select the texture file that you downloaded from the Internet earlier. The image will appear in your black thumbnail box.
