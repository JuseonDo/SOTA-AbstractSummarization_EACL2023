 If you're knitting without a pattern or if the pattern is very vague, you might be left up to your own devices to choose a decrease. Consider whether you want a hole in the knitting or a seamless change. The following steps will help you to learn about some of the the different decreases.;
, To do this, decrease slide your needle under the second down stitch as if you were going to knit into it and pick up the first stitch as well. Then knit both of them. You're basically treating two stitches like they are one. This is a very tight, right-slanting decrease.
, Use the right needle to slip the second stitch on the left needle over this stitch and off. Slip the first left needle stitch back onto the right needle to finish a right slanting decrease.
 Slip the first two stitches (knitwise) off your left needle and onto your right. Insert the left needle back into both stitches and knit them from the back. This is another tight, right slanting decrease.









There is also SSK improved, where you slip the first stitch knitwise and the second stitch purlwise so the decrease lays flatter.
 Come up with the back through the two stitches and purl them together for a right slanting decrease.
, Slip two stitches knitwise, and then knit them together like a normal YO as you slip them back onto the left needle.
 This gives you a clue as to which decrease to use because you should use a decrease that creates the correct stitch to blend into the pattern or overall stitch on your knitting piece.
