 The bow design gives the earrings a sense of playfulness, but the sparkle makes it dressy and appropriate for evening.
 Tie a glossy bow onto a pearl necklace or bracelet.
 The brooch is generally considered a more mature piece of jewelry, common to adult women but not to children. Opting for a bow brooch keeps you looking both feminine and mature.
 A glossy silk scarf looks sophisticated and mature, while a rayon or cotton-blend scarf looks cute and girlish.
 Choose a bow made from glossy material and position it to the side or back of your head. Keep your hair down.
 The headband gives your hairstyle a structured look, while the bow keeps things playful.
 Be careful about this style, though, since it will look undeniably young and girlish.
 Choose a structured hat that naturally has a band wrapped around it, like a bucket hat or a fedora.
 A stylish bag will accentuate the playfulness of the bow while giving it a chic twist.
 A black or white clutch works well with dressier outfits, and the addition of a small bow often looks classy and timeless. Alternatively, choose a small purse with a dainty shoulder strap for the same effect.
