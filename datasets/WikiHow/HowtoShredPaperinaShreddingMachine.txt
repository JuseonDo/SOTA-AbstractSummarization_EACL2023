 You might also have to turn on the safety switch at back of shredder.;
, You can do this by pressing the "power" button on top or on front.
 It doesn't matter which way you put it in. You can place a couple sheets at a time, but do not overfeed it.


Check that you're shredding only paper. Other materials such as paperclips can break the shredder blades.
Note: most shredders can handle staples and tape, but not paperclips.
 It will save power. You do not have to switch off the safety switch (If it has one)
