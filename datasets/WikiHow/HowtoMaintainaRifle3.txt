@summary
wipe down all components using some paper towel (or cloth, but this is less important to be lint-free).

@summary
spray solvent (preferably designed to be safe to continually contact your skin, like m-pro 7) on all possibly dirty components.

@summary
let the solvent sit for a couple minutes.

@summary
scrub the whole gun with a brush (no metal bristles â€” like a toothbrush).

@summary
wipe the gun clean with lint-free cloth (you can buy pre-cut cloth, but a clean old shirt or socks also work).

@summary
wipe down the whole gun (inside and out) with a solvent-soaked lint-free cloth again, and look again for any areas turning the cloth dark, and clean it.

@summary
use the pick to get off any thick chunks of carbon or powder buildup, or buildup in tight parts of the gun.

Remove as much of the thick, caked-on carbon buildup created by the friction of use. Also wipe off any old oil and all unburnt powder buildup.
Be sure to wipe the inside of the magazine well (if available), the ejector, and the area around the chamber. You will find certain areas turn the paper towel black (clean these areas more).
On this step, precision is not required; wipe it quickly.



Many rifle manufacturers design components (even polymer and the stock) to be safely used with any solvent, but be sure there aren't types of solvents the manufacturer warns against.
A liberal amount of solvent is better than not enough.
 Make sure any area with dirt, carbon buildup, or unburnt powder has a healthy amount of solvent on it, soaking in.
 This works in the solvent and loosens up the buildup on the gun. Try to get into all the nooks and crannies.


On a bolt-action rifle, be sure to scrub all nooks and crannies of the bolt (when it is removed from the receiver).
On a gas-operated rifle, special care may be required while cleaning the gas rod area, gas tubes, or gas inlet.
 Get everywhere you put the solvent (should be pretty much everywhere) and wipe it until it wipes clean.

The most common area with carbon deposits is in the chamber. Buildup occurs in the corners of the pieces of metal.
