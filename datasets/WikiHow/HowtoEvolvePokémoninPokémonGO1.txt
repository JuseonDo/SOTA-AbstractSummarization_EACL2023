 Whenever you catch a Pokémon, such as a Pikachu, you collect both Pikachu Candy and Stardust.You need a certain number of Pikachu Candy to evolve a Pikachu (and Spearow Candy to evolve a Spearow, etc.).;
, Click on the red and white Pokéball in the bottom center of your screen. This will open another menu, which should be green.
, Click on one of them (a Pikachu, for example).
 On the page for the Pikachu, you should see a picture of the Pikachu, its HP (hit points), the type, weight, and height. You can also see Stardust and a number next to some orange “Pikachu Candy.” This number is the number of Pikachu Candies that you currently have.
 This is the button that you should press to evolve your Pokémon if you have enough Candy.If you have enough Candy, press “Evolve.”
If you don’t have enough Candy, collect more Candy.
Typically, you will need between 25 and 50 Candies to evolve your original Pokémon. However, these numbers will increase after you evolve your specific Pokémon for the first time.
