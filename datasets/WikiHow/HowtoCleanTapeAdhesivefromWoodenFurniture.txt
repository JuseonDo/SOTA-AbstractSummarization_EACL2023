@summary
spray the wd-40 onto the tape without trying to remove the tape first.

@summary
spray it and let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes.

@summary
try it both ways and decide for yourself.

@summary
understand that if you sprayed the tape with wd-40 first, this will probably go a bit easier.

@summary
use your razor scrapper at a very shallow angle to the wood, and gently peel the tape off.

@summary
go slowly.

@summary
stop and work from the other direction, always with the grain of the wood.

@summary

@summary
understand that the first pass at removing the tape, with or without wd-40, will leave tape adhesive on the wood.

@summary
keep in mind that the razor scrapper can be used on the softened adhesive residue very effectively.

@summary
use a soft cloth, like a terry washcloth.

 After a year or so of storage, the tape will not just pull off easily and a "preconditioning" of WD-40 will loosen it right up.;
, If you are careful, it may go faster if you use a single-edged razor blade as a scraper before you shoot the adhesive reside with WD-40.
 For the single-edged razor you need to have a blade holder so you have a grip of some kind to ensure that you can control the angle of the blade. That will cost you less than $2 if you have to buy one.
 However, it will work if you don't "precondition" the tape with WD-40.
 Work with the grain of the wood, rather than working across the grain.
 Keep the razor at about a 2 to 4 degree angle to the wood. You don't need to get obsessive and measure the angle; just don't dig into the wood. If the blade starts to carve wood, you will feel the resistance to motion instantly.
, It may be very soft and ready to wipe off, or you may need to shoot it with WD-40 again. If you cannot wipe it off with a cloth, shoot it again and wait another 10 minutes.
 Use the same method: work with the shallow angle slowly, and with gentle motion.


You will be amazed at how easy this is. The WD-40 softens the tape goop and lubricates the blade, so it is less likely to dig into the wood. It is smooth as silk, but it will still leave a very thin layer of tape goop behind.
 Wipe the remaining very thin, almost invisible, and with the layer of adhesive off.
