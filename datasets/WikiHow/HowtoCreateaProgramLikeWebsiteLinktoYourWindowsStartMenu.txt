 Adding icons to the Start Menu on a Windows Vista PC will do just that-add shortcut icons to your Start Menu (thereby looking like programs you can launch directly from the Start menu. However, on a Windows 7 and above PC, it will add your icons to a "QuickLinks" like toolbar to the right of the Start Menu.
 Some of the major websites on the net have preferable ones. (Facebook, wikiHow, Yelp, and Digg all have ones.)


It's preferable to use ones with different icons, but ones that don't work to, but aren't as beautiful as the non-default icon websites.
,,, This will bring up a dialog box asking you to verify what you'd like to use this icon for. Although at first it won't allow you to change the icon's name you can Rename a Program on the Start Menu quite easily.


Open the Start Menu.
Open the "All programs" area of your Start menu.
Right click the text portion of the link you'd like to Edit
Click "Rename"
Make the edits you want to use for the name to meet your standards.
Press â†µ Enter when you are finished.
