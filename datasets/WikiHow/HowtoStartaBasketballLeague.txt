 Do you want it to be streetball? Or are you going to be in need of a gym?;
, You should try to contact your county or city and ask them if you could use the local gym at your nearest schools. Usually they'll allow it.
 For example 7-8 year olds, 9-10 year olds, 11-12 year olds, ect.
 try to get a minimum of 10. This will be your board.
 You do need insurance, so you need to vote on getting this done.
 Hold signups at a gym.
 You can go to eteamz.com and get a website at a very low cost that specializes in basketball websites or you can go to hometeamsonline.com. Create a free league at PlayerMania.com, it also allows your players to network.
 Usually some of the parents of the kids have a business or something. Usually a local McDonalds or something will sponsor.
 Draft all of the kids onto a team. Hold a special date to do this. Make it fair, though.
 Usually schedule a minimum of 10 games in the season (such as once per Sunday and one during the week. Then you can schedule a tournament.
 They will take the pictures of all of the teams. Parents will love this.
 Or you can hire some. This will make the game more exciting.
 Congratulations, you now have a basketball league!
