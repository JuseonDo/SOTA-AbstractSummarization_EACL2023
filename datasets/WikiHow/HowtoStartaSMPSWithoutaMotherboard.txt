 Be sure that your computer is completely turned off prior to starting. Remove the screws that are present in the side panel of your computer. You need to remove only one side of the panel.;
, Please note that some connections contains a clip attached to it. Make sure to remove the clips before you remove your connections.
, Try to locate green and black wire. Please note, that there will be one green wire and many black wires. You can select any black wire you want.
