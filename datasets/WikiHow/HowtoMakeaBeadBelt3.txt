 Be sure to leave a bit of room on either side, width wise, beyond where the bead strip will extend. This will show once you have attached the beads, which will save on wear and tear. Each strip should be a bit longer than the belt will be, since you still need to attach the buckle. These strips will be sewn on top of each other to make the belt thick enough.
, It should begin right after where you want the hole, and end right before the buckle.
 This will be easiest with a needle made for sewing leather, though quilting needles may work if you don't have a leather needle.
,, The usual shape is probably easiest. Make sure you have the two sides lined up well, and pinned together, before you cut.
 You can either use a straight row of stitches just above where the bead strip, or wrap the stitches over and around the edge of the belt, depending on the look you want. Use contrasting thread for a different look.
