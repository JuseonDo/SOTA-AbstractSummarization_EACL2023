 Stereo Mix is any sound that comes out of your speakers. ANY SOUND! So exit any program that makes sound like IM services, Email, etc.. Near the bottom left in audacity, set the "project rate" to 44100.
 See Audacity's help files for more info on this. Adjust the slider next to the microphone icon until the input volume stays around just over 3/4th's. This is called normalizing. The volume slider in iTunes should be at full.
