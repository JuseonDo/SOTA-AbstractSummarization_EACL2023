 Once you turn of the water, you will need to drain the pipes of any remaining water. If you plan to change a washer on a tap upstairs, you need to turn on the water downstairs, which will drain the pipes completely.;
,, The plastic cover should be near the H (hot) and C (cold) indicators.
 Most manufacturers use slotted screws to secure the connection, so have a Phillips screwdriver ready.
 You want to place a towel over the faucet and hold the faucet with plumber's pliers so the faucet does not move while you are releasing the nut.
, Some release valves have a small nut that holds the washer in place on the valve, and some will not. You can use a small flat-head screwdriver to pry out the washer.
 Put everything back together by reversing the process.
