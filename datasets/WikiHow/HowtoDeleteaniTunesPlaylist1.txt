, iTunes orders your playlists along one side of the screen. Clicking the one you want to delete highlights it and shows the songs it contains.
 If your keyboard has a Delete key, you can delete a playlist by clicking it and pressing Delete. iTunes will ask you to confirm that you want to delete the playlist. Don't worry: deleting a playlist does not delete any songs from your computer, so you can add them to other playlists later.


If your mouse only has a single button, holding down Control (sometimes labeled Ctrl) and clicking is the same as right-clicking on a two-button mouse.
