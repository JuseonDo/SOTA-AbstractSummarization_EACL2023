 This way you get the spiritual blessing even if the sermon/homily is dull.


Even if you're not spiritual (but have to go to church out of respect for your family, etc), the Bible does have some interesting historical aspects to it, especially if it's an abridged/modernized language version. There are plenty of very engaging sections related to war, betrayal, etc.;
, Is there someone new in church today that you could make friends with?

, As in... Draw pictures. You may want to take a small blank page diary to church for this purpose. (You could draw on the church bulletin, but please do not draw in a songbook or on the offering envelopes.)

, A small notebook will do nicely for this purpose, and you have the dual benefit of being able to remember the sermon later.
, Be aware that you will need to do any paper cutting in advance, as scissors make noise when you cut paper. Some "church crafts" that might be appropriate are:



Ribbon Bookmarks. These are quiet, easy to make, and don't take long, so if the sermon gets interesting, you can just quietly put it away.

Jute Jewelry. This is another quiet craft that can be easily stowed in your purse.

Origami. The only caution here is to do any paper cutting in advance and take care when folding not to crinkle the paper. (makes noise)

, You can use the excuse of amusing the child / keeping the child quiet to play with the child and the felt set!,,, You can learn a lot from a minister/preacher and that can help you in your walk with the Lord. A great use of time would be to write notes in a notebook about the sermon, or you can highlight verses in your Bible. It makes it easier to find key verses!

,, This enables you to understand that going to Church in some countries is nearly impossible, or is simply unheard of and you will begin to understand just how blessed you are in your life.
