Collect an avantoe herb. Invest in clean avantoe for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy avantoes are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect 1 snape grass. Kill either waterfiends or chaos droids for their drops or get the respawns at the Crafting Guild's peninsula or on Waterbirth Island.
 This will create a "Avantoe Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose fishing potion.
