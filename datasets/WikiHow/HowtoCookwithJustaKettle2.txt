 Use the kettle the way it is meant to be used, especially for kettles with narrow top openings.
 The container should be at least twice as big as the can.


With a bigger pot, you can do several cans, at once.
 Leave at least 1/2" of the can exposed, so you can pick it out. Cover to keep more heat in, if you like.
, The can will be hot, but not 'boiling' hot.
 You can't mess this up. If you forget, just repeat. It's still sealed in the can. Like the kettle, the pot or other container won't be 'dirty'.
