, With your tool or knife, pry open the glass from the frame by slowly starting from the bottom right of the iPad and moving your way to the top right.
 Warning: If you have a 3G (cellular) version be careful when moving across as to not cut the cables for the antenna. Once you have done this do the same for the top left to the bottom left and so on for the bottom right to the bottom left.
 You will see a cable at the bottom left connecting the iPad front glass and the LCD screen will be exposed.The LCD screen is secured by four Phillips head screws, one on each corner. Remove each screw and set them aside. Make sure you do not lose them.
 If you do, don't worry these can be easily rubbed off. Once you lift the LCD screen a bit you will notice there is a cable with a locker connecting it to the main logic board.
 Also there will be some adhesive tape to the left of the locker connector, remove this. Gently and evenly pull out the LCD cable from the logic board and put the LCD aside.
 You will have to do the same as the LCD screen by unlocking and remove the adhesive tape before sliding out the cable. Once you have done this remove and dispose of the old front glass.
 Make sure you remove all the adhesive. If you do not remove this thoroughly your new screen will not stick on correctly.
 Place the new front glass and then secondly the LCD screen. Remove any dust on the LCD screen by wiping it with a lint free cloth or microfibre cloth. Finally remove the paper over the new screen adhesive and any protective plastic on the inside of the screen.
 Let the adhesive set and then test your iPad
