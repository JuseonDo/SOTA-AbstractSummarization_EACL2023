 The danger lies not in what you eat, but in how much you eat. Having a healthy snack before you go to a party can help to take the edge off your hunger.;
, Serve nuts in the shell. Cracking them takes time, and stops you cramming them into your mouth in handfuls.
 Help yourself to less meat, more vegetables and salads, but go easy on creamy sauces and dressings.
 Keep a stack of easy-peel citrus where people can help themselves. Before a meal, put a bowl of celery sticks, apple pieces or carrot curls on the table – kids and adults love to nibble on these.
 Take time choosing the treats of the day, savour the flavour - then stop.
