 Bananas that are still basically green will ripen slowly over a period of time, whereas, already fully ripe bananas will become overripe very quickly.


For cooking, such as banana pudding, you can choose ripe bananas if you buy only the amount you need for the recipe, and use them in short order.
For eating daily, choose a bunch of bananas that show signs of ripening, preferably with some very nearly ripe to be eaten shortly after they are bought some greener ones which will ripen in a few days to be eaten then.;
, Make this decision based on your own experience from previous purchases.
 Also, you may want to check for debris on their skins.
