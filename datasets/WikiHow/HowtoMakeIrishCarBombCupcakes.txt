 Line the muffin tins with the cupcake liners.;
, Let it sit over medium heat until it starts to simmer. When it does, add the cocoa powder and whisk until it is smooth. Turn off the stove and let the mixture cool slightly.
 When finished, set the mixer speed to slow and gradually add the chocolate from the saucepan.
, Be sure to fill them only halfway, as they will rise in the oven and overflow onto the pan if the liner is overfilled with too much batter. Put the cupcakes in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife stuck in the center comes out clean.
 Place a smaller sized bowl on top that rests just above the water without actually touching it. Be sure that the water does not reach the bowl or it will burn the chocolate. Finely chop the bittersweet chocolate then add to the bowl with the butter.
 Once completely melted, add the heavy cream and whiskey and stir until combined. When done, turn off the heat and let cool, stirring occasionally so the chocolate doesn't harden.
 Using the decoration tip, make a small hole in the center of the cupcake for the filling. Fill the ganache into the pastry bag and begin piping into the center of the cupcakes until all cupcakes have been filled.
 If the butter is right out of the fridge, do not microwave to soften quicker. This will only melt the ends to a liquid and it will make mixing the powdered sugar difficult. Once the butter is whipped, add the powdered sugar and then the Baileys. Keep the mixer on for about 2 more minutes.
, Store in an airtight container.
