Remove a quarter of the liquid from a litre bottle of vodka. Pour it into another bottle for storage and future use.
Chop up the Mars bars so to a consistency that allows them to fit through the neck of the vodka bottle.
 Don't worry about how it looks - not so appealing at this point!

, Make sure it's tight and secure.
 The heat of the water will melt the Mars bars and dissolve the chocolate into the vodka.
 If the Mars bars are not all completely dissolved, put it back in the dishwasher for another cycle.
 Place it in the freezer to cool it down. Once frozen, it's ready to drink!
