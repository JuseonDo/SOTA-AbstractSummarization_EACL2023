 Get the kind of lip gloss that comes with a wand applicator. Do not use the kind that you have to squeeze to get out., Set the wand applicator aside, preferably on a plate so that your table won't get sticky., Both cinnamon essential oil and peppermint essential oil have lip-plumping abilities. They help improve blood circulation to your lips. This may help make your lips appear fuller.Cinnamon oil can be irritating. Consider mixing a drop or two with some oil (such as olive oil) and dabbing it on your inner elbow. If it doesn't irritate your skin, you're good to go., You can also pump the wand applicator up and down in the tube a few times to mix the oil into the lip gloss.
