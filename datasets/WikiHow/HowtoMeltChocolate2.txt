@summary
measure out how much chocolate you want to melt.

@summary
place the desired amount of chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl.

@summary
microwave on the lowest heat setting for approximately 30 to 40 seconds.

@summary
stir the melted chocolate with a wooden spoon and reintroduce into the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds.

@summary
stir and repeat microwaving in 10 second bursts until the chocolate is fully melted.
@article
 Break up the chocolate into smaller pieces with a knife if needed.
 Place the bowl into the microwave.
 Be sure to change your power setting to the lowest you can before nuking the chocolate.









If you are using small chocolate chips, the cooking time on the initial blast will be much lower than 30 seconds. Go in intervals of 10 to 15 seconds initially to make sure that the chocolate chips won't burn.
 Continue to microwave the chocolate on its lowest setting.










A less expensive chocolate might be better suited for your first try at microwaving, in case it's accidentally scorched. Burning a less expensive chocolate is a lot easier on the psyche (and the wallet) than a more expensive one.
