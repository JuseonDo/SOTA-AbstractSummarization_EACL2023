The seed is the number from which to begin counting
The increment is the amount to increment in each step/item of the series.
 In most calculators this is done by a "C", "CA" or "CE" button. However, turning the calculator off then back on is a more guaranteed method in most calculators.


If not sure, do them all!

,,,, Keep pressing the "=" button for more results.


In some calculators, the "=" must be followed by an "Ans" (short for "Answer") key. In which case you should try pressing the "Ans" key repetitively.
