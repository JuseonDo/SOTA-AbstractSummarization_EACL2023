@summary
position the patient's arm so the elbow is about even with the heart and slightly bent.

,

@summary
wrap a blood pressure cuff, or sphygmomanometer, around the patient's upper arm.

@summary
use the stethoscope on the arm to listen for a pulse.

@summary
close the valve and use the bulb to inflate the cuff.

@summary
continue inflating until the gauge reads 30 millimeters of mercury (mmhg) higher than it did when the pulse disappeared.

@summary
,

@summary
open the valve just enough to let the air out slowly, no faster than 5 mmhg per second.

@summary
note the reading when you can hear the pulse again.

@summary
continue deflating the cuff while listening to the pulse.

@summary
,

@summary
note the reading when the pulse disappears again.

@summary
write down the blood pressure.

@summary
take the blood pressure in the other arm and compare the readings.

@summary
record each blood pressure reading, the arm you used to take the reading, and the time at which you took it.

@article
, It should be snub but not tight, and high enough so the cuff doesn't sit in the crook of the elbow. Make sure you can see the gauge.


Use the right size cuff for the patient. Children and obese adults require different sizes of cuffs.
 You may have to hunt around between the cuff and the elbow, or even place the diaphragm of the stethoscope slightly under the cuff.


You may need to inflate the cuff slightly to put enough pressure on the artery to detect the pulse.
 Listen for the pulse to disappear.
, Listen for the pulse to return.
 This is the systolic pressure, which is the pressure exerted on the arteries when the heart is pumping the blood.
, This is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure on the arteries between heartbeats.
 First list systolic pressure, then forward slash, then diastolic pressure. An example of a blood pressure reading is 120/70, which you would read as "120 over 70."

, For subsequent blood pressure readings, use the arm that gives the highest reading.


Normal blood pressure for adults is a systolic reading of less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic reading of less than 90 mmHg. However, patients in distress may have higher pressures, and patients who are going into shock may have diastolic readings of less than 80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure readings for children vary by age.
Be aware that you may experience an auscultatory gap, when the pulse temporarily disappears, between the systolic and diastolic readings. If the reading you get isn't what you expect, try again.
