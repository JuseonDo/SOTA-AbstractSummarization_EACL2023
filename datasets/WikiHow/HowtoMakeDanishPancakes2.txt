Whisk quickly to break the yolk and combine the ingredients., Whisk quickly to combine the ingredients, moistening everything. Do not over mix; leave the batter lumpy., Fill about halfway.,

If you want to place something in the middle of the pancakes, such as bits of meat, jam, pieces of fruit, etc., do it at this point so that the items sink into the middle of the pancake before flipping over.
 Cook again for another minute until the other side is browned., Tip the pancakes out onto plates., These can be served as they are or you can accompany them with jam, cream, fresh fruit, syrup, dusted with confectioners/icing sugar, etc.
