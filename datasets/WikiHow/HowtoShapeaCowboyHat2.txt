feel for the shaping wire in the hat brim.

bend the wire gently to shape the brim as you want it to look.
@article










Straw cowboy hat brims are either pre-shaped or made with a shaping wire. You won’t be able to shape a pre-shaped straw hat made without a wire, as the methods used for other materials will damage the straw.
 It may be woven into the straw or covered with a decorative edging.










The shaping wire is made to be reshaped more than once, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different looks.
