 It could be a happy look, gorgeous look, or rich-looking.;
, Don't worry about voluptuous curves or too-thin lines; you can rub these out later and replace them with any kind you want.
 Make sure you capture the mood or feeling you want your picture to have in their body language and facial expressions.
 Sketch them roughly and do not make any dark lines you may regret later. Remember to over-accessorize if they're rich and keep it simple if they're poor.
 Does it express the feelings you wanted it to? Do the clothes outline who it is and what it is? Does the look of your angel or fairy reflect its personality? Is there anything you'd like to change? If so, make the changes.
, Depending on what kind of fairy/angel you are creating, you may want to coordinate the colours specially. For a water fairy, shades of blue, green, and other cool colours would be well suited. A fire fairy would be colored in red, orange, yellow, and so on. You can also coordinate the colours of its surroundings.
 If you would like, you could frame it and display it on a wall.
