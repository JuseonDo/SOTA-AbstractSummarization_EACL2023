Gerne means "gladly."

Geschehen means "happen," "occur," or "take place."
The literal translation of the phrase will not make much sense, but it essentially sends the message that you are glad to have done something for the speaker offering thanks.
The phrase is pronounced, GHERN gah-SHANE.



Pronounce the term as GHERN.
