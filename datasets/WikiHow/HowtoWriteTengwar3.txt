 The Sindarin mode of Beleriand only uses tehtar for a few purposes (see picture). Because of this, it is known as a "full" mode of tengwar. Also, as this is the original full mode, other full modes are sometimes known as "Beleriandic" modes (there's a second full mode for Sindarin, the Sindarin full mode of Gondor, and two English full modes, in case you were wondering).
 A diphthong is a pair of vowels pronounced as one sound. All other vowel combinations are to be pronounced as individual vowels. Note that the diphthongs for ae and oe are written as a pair of symbols.
 In Sindarin, there are only four double letters (nn, mm, ll and ss). The correct way of writing each one in this mode is given above.
 The above table gives the values for this mode.
