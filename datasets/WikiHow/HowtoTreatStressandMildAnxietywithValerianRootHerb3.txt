 Of course, if it has immediate negative effects, stop taking it immediately. If you don’t notice any change for several weeks, it might be time to move on to other methods of reducing anxiety., Even if you are experiencing some relief from valerian, if your anxiety is high enough that it affects your ability to function, therapy may be able to help. You may even need medication such as an SSRI to help your anxiety. At any rate, a mental health professional will be able to help you make that assessment.If you are unsure whether you need a mental health professional, it’s always a good idea to go and talk it over with that mental health professional. They’ll be able to assess whether you would benefit from additional therapy.
 You may need to see a doctor in order to know what you need for your stress and anxiety. A doctor may have some additional natural recommendations and can also prescribe anti-anxiety medication, if necessary.
