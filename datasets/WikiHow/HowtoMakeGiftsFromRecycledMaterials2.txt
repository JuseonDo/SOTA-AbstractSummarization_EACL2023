 This is a great project if you have vinyl records that you cannot sell or play, but you want to make a gift for someone who loves music. While vinyl building materials are often recycled, records are made of such strong plastic that they cannot normally be recycled in post-consumer recycling programs., This is usually the lowest setting, or "warm" setting on an oven., The bowl must be oven safe, so check the manufacturer's indications when using any other type of bowl., Use potholders or kitchen mitts to slide it to the center of the rack.,, Turn on your oven light so you can see when the record begins to soften, melting slightly.,, Place it on a heat-proof surface, like the stovetop., Make sure to smooth it up on all sides. The record will have extra plastic when it is bent, so it will form a ridged effect., Place it back in the oven at 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.6 degrees Celsius) to reshape it.
