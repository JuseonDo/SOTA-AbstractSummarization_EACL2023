 Be very careful not to cut out any of the graphics or design.
 The last thing you want is for “month 12” template to land on a onesie sized for a three month old! Lay the correct template on the corresponding shirt and lightly add a small piece of clear tape to ensure it stays in place.
 To ensure the best transfer, make sure each little shirt is flat and free from wrinkles.
 Or, follow the transfer paper package instructions.
 Be sure to do this slowly as the design might rip off with the paper otherwise.
