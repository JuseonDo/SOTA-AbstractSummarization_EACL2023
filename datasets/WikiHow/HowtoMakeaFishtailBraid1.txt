 You will have a left piece and a right piece.;
, Gather it from the outside. It should be no thicker than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
 Move it towards the right one.
 It will now become part of the right section.
 Move your hands up as far as they can go. The tighter you make your braid, the better; you can always tousle it for a messier look later.
 Gather it from the outside of the section, and make it no thicker than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
 Move it towards the left section.
 It is now part of the left section.
 Leave at least an inch (2.54 centimeters) of your hair unbraided so that you can tie it off.









Try to use thinner strands the further down you go on your braid.This will help make your braid look more even; your hair becomes naturally thinner towards the ends.
 If you want, you can take a strand of hair, and wrap it around the hair tie to hide it. Secure the strand with a bobby pin.
 You may want to skip this if your hair has lots of layers; it may end up loosening and getting tousled on its own.
