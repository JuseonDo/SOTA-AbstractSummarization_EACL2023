 If you mess up then hey, it'll just be even more awkward.;
, If you don't know exactly what that is, just do something that humans don't usually do because it is generally uncomfortable.
 For example, wearing a slightly baggy turtleneck can give a person character.
 If you're just a mean person, then people will probably make fun of you for your mannerisms, or you may across as strange. However, being nice to everyone prompts them to get a good impression of you and your unique character.
 They are probably just jealous and thinking, "Man, I wish that I could be like that person and do whatever without worrying about ruining my normal person image."

, For example " Man I'm so jealous of Ryan Seacrest! Did you see his hands yesterday? They looked just looked so supple!"

, Just don't use them all the time, or else you may get annoying. If your accents are bad, even better!

, For example if you are a fifteen year old girl, one day you could just start acting like that old man across the street who likes to make his own jam.
 For example: dutch poodle breeding.
 For example "Oh my lanta!", "Gee Wilikers!", or "Confound it!"

, The main reason people convert to awkward is to have fun doing unusual things. So go enjoy!
