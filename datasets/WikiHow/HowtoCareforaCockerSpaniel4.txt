 Cocker spaniels are occasionally difficult to potty train. Be firm while you're housebreaking your puppy, but patient. Repetition is the best way for your cocker to become housebroken., After a nap is a common time to take your cocker outside or even after a long period of time since they have last used the bathroom.
 When they need to go, repeatedly take your dog to the same spot. Eventually, they will learn to go to the bathroom in the same spot outside.


Having a common spot to use the bathroom is useful for encouraging your cocker to make. The smell of urine in the same spot will encourage your cocker to urinate as well.
 Things like "Go Potty" or "Do Your Business" can be triggers for dogs to know it's ok to go to the bathroom.
 The smell or urine may encourage your cocker to go again. Make sure your cocker can go outside without you to avoid accidents.


Gently scold your cocker for accidents. Don't be mean or hit the dog, but make sure they know they did a bad thing.
 This way they can find their way to an enclosed yard to use the bathroom whenever they feel the urge. They may not always be able to tell when they need to go, so itâ€™s important for them to be able to get out on their own.


Occasional accidents are unavoidable with a cocker, since they often urinate when they get excited. Be patient and understand it may take awhile to potty train your cocker.
