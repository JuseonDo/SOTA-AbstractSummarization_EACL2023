 Put them into a blender and mix for 15-20 seconds. This circulates the air.


The thicker the milk you use (2%, for example) the thicker your milkshake will be.;

 This will work best with pre-crushed ice. Watch it as it blends -- if it blends too much, it will get quite runny.
 Consume immediately -- it's best when cold and the ice still gives it texture.
