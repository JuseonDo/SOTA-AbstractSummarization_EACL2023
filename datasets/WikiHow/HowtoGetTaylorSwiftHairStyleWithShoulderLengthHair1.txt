 Do everything normal for washing,only wash twice if said by stylist.;
, Do not rub wet hair which is more fragile and can break. Detangle strands from the ends to the roots.
 Apply from ears to the very ends. Distribute well. If your hair is fine or thin, apply a volumizing gel or similar products to the roots to get lots of body and movement. Scrunch it in; don't run it through or brush it

,, Get a blow-dryer and dry your hair.
, Spray with hair-spray.
 Sometimes when you're done drying without a brush you can see or pull out small sections that have separated themselves. It's better to use those if you can locate them, disturbing the natural separation of your hair will sometimes cause a frizzy look or fly-aways. Do not run the curling iron from the scalp to the ends, instead place it on the end of the section, hold it away from your head vertically and then spin it in so that your hair wraps around it with a spiral effect. You may need to adjust how long you hold the iron in the hair depending on the temperature of the iron and your hair.
 The bottom layers should require less of the section to be curled. This should also help you maintain the appearance of your length. If you would like to have your hair look thicker you can curl your section closer or farther from the scalp to adjust that. Repeat this all over your head until the desired look is achieved. It may take some practice to get the idea so you may want to play, or practice making the curls.
 Don't hesitate to spray too while you are working if you have hard to curl hair. If you end up with a few corners, or bends, just soften then with a light spin of the iron on the desired spot.
