@summary
design a bookmark with ribbon.

@summary
cut approximately 2 inches/5cm of ribbon.

slide the ribbon through the bottom of one paperclip.

 This is one of the easiest and quickest bookmarks to create.
 The ribbon will be attached to the end of the paperclip and provide quick page retrieval access.
 Make sure the paperclip ends are on the opposite side from where it will be slid onto the page.
 Hold the ribbon for a few minutes until the glue has dried.
