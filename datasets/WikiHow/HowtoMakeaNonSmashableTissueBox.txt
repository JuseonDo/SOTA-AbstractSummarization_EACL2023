 Since tissue boxes come in a variety of shapes and sizes you will want to select a re-useable, plastic container that will provide a perfect fit for the box.


Purchase the re-usable container and tissue box from the same store so you can make sure you have a good match.;
, You may want to position your box of tissue inside the container, with the top part of the tissue box facing toward the bottom of the container. When you turn the re-usable container upside down you will see the top of the tissue box.
 Using the tissue box as your guide, use your pen or pencil to create the same opening on the bottom of the container.
 Remove the cut piece of plastic from the container.
 Line up the tissue box opening with the area you just cut.
, You should have a fully contained tissue box, encased in the re-usable container.
