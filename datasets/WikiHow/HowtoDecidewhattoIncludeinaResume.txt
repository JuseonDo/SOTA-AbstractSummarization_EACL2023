 This should give you an idea of what your employer is looking for, not just for the position, but for the "tone" of the company.
 They can be implied by the phrasing or company philosophy. For instance, if the company prides itself on "customer service", they probably want an employee to be a "people person".
 For example, if the company is looking for people with creative problem solving skills, highlight your stint as a camp counselor.
 If you know how to make 3D computer animations, speak Russian, or demonstrate your leadership abilities by coaching you daughter's peewee soccer team, speak up. Any expertise in the company's field, even if not directly relevant to your prospective position, is a plus for you. For example, if you're applying to be a website designer for a geology museum, be sure to mention your geology minor or your volunteer work at a geology museum.
 The computer programming company doesn't care about your wilderness survival certification, and the ski patrol doesn't care that you are fluent in JavaScript.
