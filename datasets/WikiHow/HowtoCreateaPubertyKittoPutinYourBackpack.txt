 The supplies you need are:


Your backpack
A small to medium makeup bag or pencil case
Pads and pantyliners. (It is not a good idea to use tampons if you are just starting out. Also, pantyliners can help you avoid surprises if you wear them every day. They are also good for discharge.)
A spare pair of underwear and a plastic bag.
Some makeup, if you wear makeup.
Deodorant.
A hair comb, clips, pins, hair bands, etc.
Lip balm.
Nail clippers.
Mints or gum.;
, Make sure they all fit, or you might have to find a bigger bag or take out some stuff.,, When your hairbands break, or your deodorant has been used up, replenish it. That way you are always prepared.
