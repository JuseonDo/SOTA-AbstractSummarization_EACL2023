 You can buy flaked coconut online or in the baking aisle. Flaked coconut come in larger chunks than shredded coconut., Take out a large mixing bowl. Combine 1 1/4 cup flour, 1 1/3 cup flaked coconut, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.Before you add the baking soda, check to make sure it is not expired. Expired baking soda can make your cookies turn out flat. We’re going for chewy, plump cookies in this recipe.
 If you’re using an electric mixer to cream the wet ingredients, use the mixer bowl. If you’re combining the wet ingredients by hand, use a regular mixing bowl.


Cream the 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar until smooth.
 Beat until the batter is light and fluffy.
 Do this by adding the flour mixture in batches of three so you don’t over mix the batter.
 Try not to make the cookies too large and about 3 inches apart.


If your batter is hard to shape with the tablespoon, place it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to cool. Then, use a tablespoon or a small scoop to place the cookies on the cookie sheet.
 They should appear lightly toasted and golden in color.


This recipe makes about 3 dozen cookies. You may end up with more or less cookies, depending on the size of the spoon or scoop used to shape the cookie dough.
 Serve as a snack or dessert with tea, coffee, or milk!


Once you master the basic coconut cookie, you may want to try adding other ingredients to the batter, like nuts. Fold in chopped macadamia nuts or almonds after you have combined the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients.
Another nice addition is drizzling the top of the coconut cookies with dark chocolate once they have cooled.
