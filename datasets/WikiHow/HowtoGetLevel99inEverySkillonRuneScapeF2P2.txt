 They are quite expensive, but the first few levels go by fast

, Getting level 30 won't take long.
 They are extremely cheap and very fast XP for those levels.
 They are also extremely cheap and up to 160,000 XP.
 You will need about 20 mil to get 99 firemaking with yew. If you cannot afford 99 firemaking with yews, burning maple all the way to 99 works too. 99 firemaking should take only 80 hours with maple or 50 hours with yew.
