 Shubunkin Goldfish get very large, so a 50 gallon (189.3 L) tank is the smallest tank you can keep one in. Keep the live plants to a minimum; Shubunkins will uproot them.;
, Shubunkin Goldfish are peaceful schooling fish that mix well with other goldfish of the same size and shape. Make sure there is at least one other fish with your Shubunkin.
 Shubunkin Goldfish are cold water fish, so make sure what you put with them is okay with low water temperature.
 Shubunkin Goldfish eats flakes and/or pellets once or twice a day, and you should also vary their diet. They're omnivores, so you'll have a variety of options.
 Shubunkins are rather messy.
