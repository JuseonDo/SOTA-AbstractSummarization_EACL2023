 Cut the front and back sides out and lay them flat on your workspace in a row.
 Your closet dividers can be an expression of your personal style and match your home d√©cor., Place a piece of scrapbook or wrapping paper directly on top of the glue and smooth it out., Repeat with as many box sides as you plan to use., Find a round, plastic container lid, such as 1 that comes on top of a cocoa, ovaltine or baby formula cardboard container. You will use this to trace your divider shape.

You can also draw a large oblong shape freehand; however, the lid helps you to ensure all of the dividers are the same, large size.
 Trace 1 circle and then trace another 1 just beside it, to create an oblong shape. Where the circles connect, it should form a straight line., Repeat the process 4 times on each side of a cereal box, until you have enough dividers for all the types of clothing hanging in your closet., Make sure the cap is slightly larger than the bar on which your clothing hangs., Cut the small circle out at the top of your dividers.

The cut upward will allow you to insert the divider onto the clothing bar. If you cut from the top down to the circle, your divider will not stay on your closet bar.
 Hang them on your closet bar and divide your clothing accordingly.
