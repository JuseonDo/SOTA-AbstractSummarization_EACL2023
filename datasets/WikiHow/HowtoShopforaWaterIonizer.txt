@summary
understand that all electric ionizers will produce three types of water: alkaline ionized, purified or filtered, and ionized acidic, regardless of model, design, brand, or price point.

@summary
decide if you would like a countertop, undercounter or convertible model.

@summary
decide which features are important to you.

@summary
if you plan to use ionized acidic water for disinfecting on contact, you will need a machine that can produce 2.7 ph water in your water source.

@summary
do your research.

@summary
don't forget to purchase a pre-filter.

, Undercounter models are typically more expensive and more difficult to install (unless you already have a hole drilled for a soap dispenser), however they take up less space.
 The main difference between each ionizer is that it has either 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 or 11 ionization plates which effects the flow rate and pH ranges (maximum pH ranges and ORP ranges can be achieved with a 5 or 7 plate machine). All the other functions and bells and whistles are a matter of preference.
 This can be difficult if you live in a soft water area, as not all machines can make strong acid water under those conditions without chemical alteration.
 Make sure the company you are ordering from has a good reputation, certifications and a solid warranty and return policy.
 No onboard ionization filter addresses all chemicals and contaminants out there, so pre-filters are necessary for optimal drinking water regardless of which brand you choose.
