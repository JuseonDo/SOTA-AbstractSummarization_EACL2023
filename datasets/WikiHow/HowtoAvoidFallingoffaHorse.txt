 Sit back in the saddle - think of it as sitting on your back pockets. Don't lean forward. This way, if the horse veers, you won't keep going over the top of his head.;
, Try not to let your legs flop around or nudge the horse with your calves. He will think you want him to go faster.
, Let the short-rein hand sit on your thigh and pull the horse into a turn. The horse will have to slow down. Keep pulling, forcing him in small and small circles until he stops. You'll have more power if you keep your arms close to your body.
 Find it with your toes.
 On an English saddle, there is often a little strip of leather called a bucking strap. On a Western saddle, grab the horn and press your seat down into the saddle. You can also hold onto the horse's mane at the withers - the little crest at the base of his mane. It won't hurt the horse.
 Whatever he's got in mind, he's not going to keep going forever. Just concentrate on keeping your seat, and you'll be all right.
