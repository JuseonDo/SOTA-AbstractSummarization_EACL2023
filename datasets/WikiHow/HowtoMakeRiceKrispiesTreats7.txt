 These treats are best on the day they're made. Otherwise, you might find yourself chewing on a rock.
 This should only be used for 2 days, after which time the treats should be disposed of.
 Simply layer on wax paper to separate the treats and place into an airtight container suitable for freezing. They will keep well for up to 6 weeks.


To thaw, remove from the freezer. Allow to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes, then separate from the wax paper and serve.
