,,, You want it to be healthy,right? So don't feed it junk food everyday! So maybe instead of feeding it on chips and burgers, use fruits, fish, salad, etc.
 DON'T leave it on the floor!!! If you have more, older stuffed creatures or animals let them meet and become best friends.
!That's not nice!! Don't forget about them or throw them around that would make them feel unloved and they might run away

,!Don't let it be homeless. If you can't make it a house that's okay just at least try and make it a bed, if not then just let it sleep with you

, If they can't then just put a bandage on it.
 If you do they might run away and that wouldn't be good now would it? So don't forget about them

, All you need to do is LOVE them and never stop loving them
