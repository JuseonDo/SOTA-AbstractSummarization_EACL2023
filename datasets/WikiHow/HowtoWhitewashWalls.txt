 Mix the 2 ingredients together until the paste is creamy. Let the mixture sit overnight.;
,, Stir the mixture again until it becomes a thick paste-like consistency.
 Stir well until the mixture is completely blended and has a similar consistency to cake or brownie batter. Continue stirring the mixture, adding extra water if you feel it is too thick. It's easier to fix a solution that is too thick than too thin, so only add small amounts of water at a time.
 Watch it dry, if it dries looking coarse and bumpy, the solution is too thick and more water needs to be added.
 Add pigments, purchased from a local hardware store, that can be safely added to any paint or plaster mixture.
 These stains can show through after whitewashing.
 This will help the whitewash spread once you apply the whitewash.
 It is easiest to apply the whitewash to the tips of the brush and lightly apply it to the wall. You should be aware that whitewash is thicker than paint and doesn't go on as smoothly as interior paint does.
