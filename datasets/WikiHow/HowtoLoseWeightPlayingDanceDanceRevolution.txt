if you're thinking, "whoa, one of those huge arcade machines in my home?,

@summary
buy a ddr game that is made for whatever kind of gaming device you have.

@summary
once you've set it up with your gaming device, start playing on beginner mode unless you've played the game before and you're good at it.

@summary
once you can do most songs on basic mode, go to workout mode.

@summary
soon you'll be able to burn more and more calories every day, then begin to play on difficult, then expert!,

 No way I'm gonna do that!" then you're probably not very familiar with DDR. There are many home versions, games for PlayStation, Xbox, Wii, etc. and you don't need a metal pad like the ones in arcades (unless you want one, but they're a lot more expensive and you need shoes to play them) You can get soft mats for around $20-30 each depending on brand. Get some of these.;
, Get a mat (or two, if you want to play with a friend) If you're unsure of which version of DDR you want, go look at the list of songs each one has on the internet and choose one you like.
 Do a couple of songs until you've got the hang of it. Don't worry if you're not good (or completely fail) at first, it will not be difficult forever and most DDR games have tutorials with them.
 Create a profile and start doing some songs on there. It will tell you how many calories you've burned when you're done! Try to start burning around 200 calories a day. This shouldn't take long.
 Now the songs will burn 10-40 calories each and you'll be both healthy and a DDR expert.
 If you keep eating junk food, you could do DDR 24/7 and you still won't lose weight. Follow the guidelines in How to Lose Weight.
