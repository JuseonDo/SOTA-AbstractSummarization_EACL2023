@summary
go back to your chair.

@summary
try the above exercise with some leg pressure (it sounds like this defeats the point, but it keeps your horse from stopping on his front end).

@summary
also keep your heals down.

 Push your pelvis forward. This may feel to your hands like you are relieving pressure, but a horse's back is shaped differently.
 Some horses will take longer to get the message, so sometimes a little squeeze of your hand on the rein will get their attention. Do not say "Whoa" unless the horse is not responding to your bottom.
 And don't "lock" or tighten your muscles.
