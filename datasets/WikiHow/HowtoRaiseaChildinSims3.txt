 The ideal items to put in the room are a crib, a teddy bear, a toy box, a potty chair, a toy xylophone, a shapes box, a high chair and (if your floor is wooden) a rug. Also make sure the pregnant mother reads a pregnancy book, and stays healthy and relatively happy during pregnancy. If she has back pains, try to make sure she gets a massage.Also, try to have your babies room on the first floor so it can crawl around with no steps.;
, If the mother's pregnancy went well, you should have been able to pick the baby's traits or at least the baby should have positive traits. If he/she has bad traits, go into the cheat bar by pressing ctrl+shift+C, and type in testingcheatsenabled true. Shift-click on the baby and click 'modify traits for active Sim'. Give baby desired traits.
 It also helps if they gain skills with the shapes box or the xylophone. If you do this, you will be able to pick your child's traits when they age up!

, This also plays a big part in getting good traits/getting to pick them.
 They will make friends, go to school and go to places like the pool, the library and the graveyard alone. However, they cannot handle Simoleons until they become teen and have a part time job. They have a set curfew and will be lectured if they stay out. This is a good time for your Sim to have more children. If your child is successful in school, you should be able to pick their traits, so make sure they do their homework and go to school happy!

,, They will still have a curfew and will get lectured if they're out past it, like before.
 This is when your parents have no control over them, and when their children move out, miss their child and will sometimes cry.
