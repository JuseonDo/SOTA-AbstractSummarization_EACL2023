Check on your own what are the offerings at where you plan to play. For example: 75% of the players are playing poker variation one, 15% of the players are playing variation two and the other 10% are playing the remaining poker variations.
Look broadly and see what variations are popular in your state, your country and the world.
With what knowledge you have and from the other people's opinions, predict what will be popular in the future.
