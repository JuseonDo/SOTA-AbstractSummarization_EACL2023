 Only a doctor can diagnose IBS. IBS symptoms can also be caused by other health conditions, so your doctor will probably want to run some tests before giving you an IBS diagnosis.;
, Often the "trigger foods" that cause IBS attacks are unique to the individual, but the most common triggers are high fat foods such as red meat, dairy and fried foods. After learning what foods set off your IBS, you can avoid them or eat them in moderation.
 Bulkier stool is softer and easier to pass through your digestive system. Be cautious with insoluble fiber, such as wheat bran, which can worsen IBS symptoms.
 Foods rich in lecithin are egg yolks, soybeans, cow milk butter and animal brains. You can also buy soy lecithin granules in most supermarkets or health food stores. Lecithin helps restore the endothelium which is often damaged in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
 Caffeine and nicotine serve as muscle stimulants and may aggravate sensitive bowels, contributing to IBS symptoms. Alcohol is known to be a gastric irritant.
 Large meals often set off bouts of IBS.
 Exercise helps your body to deal with stress and promotes good bowel function.
 Stress can be a trigger for IBS attacks.
 Your doctor may prescribe an anticholinergic agent to lower your intestinal activity, or a mild tranquilizer or sedative.
