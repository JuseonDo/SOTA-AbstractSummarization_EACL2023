, This is called string slap, and can be very painful.
 Don't squeeze the arrow; pull on the string and the arrow will hold itself in place.
 Draw the arrow to a comfortable spot on your face (called an "Anchor point"). Make sure you always draw back to the same anchor point or your shots will become too inconsistent. Some draw to their chin with the string running up across the tip of their nose. Others draw to the back end of their jawbone, while others find it comfortable to rest the arrow up on their cheekbone, near their eye. In this form of "instinctive" shooting, it is most common to draw to the corner of the mouth. These spots on your face are called your "anchor point". Find one that is comfortable for you, and stick to it. A consistent anchor point is key to accurate, consistent shooting.
 If you have a target with rings on it, focus on a blemish on the target within the centermost ring. If it is an animal, pick an off-colored hair to focus on. The smaller the better. Pull back and hold until that spot becomes clear and all else around it becomes a blur. This can be anywhere from about one second after drawing the bow, to the moment you contact with your anchor point.
 This prevents the bow from jumping or lurching, which will throw off your shot.
