insert the fillet knife into the anus near the tail.

@summary
spread the abdominal cavity with your fingers.

@summary
rinse the cavity out with a good stream of water.

@summary
remove the head if you like.

@summary
the fish is ready to be filleted.

@article
 Draw the knife toward the head, splitting the fish to the base of the gills.


Small pan fish can be held in one hand, while the knife work is done with the other. Large fish should be held on their back on the table.
 Reach in and pull out the entrails. Place them in the bucket you set aside for this purpose.
 Use a garden house or faucet to rinse the outside of the fish, too.
 Trout are often cooked with the head on, but pan fish heads are usually cut off behind the gills.
