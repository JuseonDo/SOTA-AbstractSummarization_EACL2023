 Make sure you don't boil the potatoes completely because they might be too soft later. Boil them so that they are a bit hard on the inside but soft enough to be eaten.
 Strain out the potatoes and mash them well.
 Press the scooped up mashed potato onto a cooking sheet or baking dish, leaving a neat mound of mashed potato on the surface. Flatten the top using a knife.
 Flatten each mound with a knife, as with the first mound.
 Sprinkle a little freshly ground black pepper atop each scoop. Add just a bit of salt as well, to taste.
