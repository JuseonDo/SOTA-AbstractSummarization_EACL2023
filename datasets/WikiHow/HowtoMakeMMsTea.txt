 Brew it in your usual way.;
,, If it is too hot, it will melt the M&Ms in spite of their candy covering. Add milk if you normally drink your tea with milk, otherwise leave it out.
 Enjoy immediately before the M&M's disintegrate too much. When they do disintegrate, mix them through with a teaspoon and enjoy what's left!
