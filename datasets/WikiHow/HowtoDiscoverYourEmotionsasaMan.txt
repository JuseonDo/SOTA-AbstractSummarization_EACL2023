 If they want to believe that men should not display emotions or connect with emotions, that is their choice. You don't have to agree or join them.;
, Instead of trying to force these feelings away, start accounting for them in your life and considering what purpose each one has in making your life more fulfilling.
 Keep a journal of your feelings and how they improve your performance at work, during leisure, within the family, etc. and start focusing on using these emotions more intelligently to improve your relations with others.
 You have them for a reason, to express them, come to terms with them and in so doing, you will hasten your own healing processes. If it were originally meant for men "not to cry", then men ideally would have been created with no tear ducts. The anatomy of men would have been built differently.
 This character trait in a man is considered somewhat appealing or even sexy.
 If others find this weird, break or steer away from their company. Hopefully they may see the advantages and follow in our footsteps.
 Do not attempt to be a blind follower. How does one clearly define being "Macho". This term is only a perception created by mindless and other fallible human beings. People have their own idea of perfection, entirely their own for the keeping and preservation. Leave other men to it, if this is what makes them happy.
 After all, it is about being essentially human. What can be so wrong in that?

, This will take you to a much higher realm, or physical state. Only good things will follow and this will help you grow in becoming an emotionally functional man.
