 Do not buy the M14 or Olympia until round two.
 It runs out of ammo really quickly.
 Like it says in the game, it's a gamble. It includes Raygun and Thundergun. If playing on map FIVE, you can get a gun called Winter's Howl.
 Activate the power, and link the teleporter. Make sure you have some good guns, because this will give an entire overview of the theater. And, if you turn around, you will see the Pack A Punch. That's why you need 5000 points. Pack a Punch your best weapon. It will make it better, plus give you max ammo.
 If you are being overrun by zombies, activating a trap will pretty much kill them all. It's only 1000 points. Just make sure you are on the right side of the trap.
