 You can refinance your loan by negotiating a reduction in principle with your lender. This is a good option if you do not qualify for HARP or HEMP and you are in danger of losing your home.
 This is unpopular with lenders because it costs them money, but worth a try. It simply cuts your interest rate and brings your monthly payment down.
 Earlier in 2012, the government reached a settlement with 5 major mortgage lenders. 3.5 billion of that settlement will support refinancing for homeowners with underwater mortgages.
