  They should be the exactly the same size.  To make it look nicer, you can also round the corners.;
,  It should be about five inches bigger than the backing so that it can wrap around the back of the board comfortably.
  Line up the corners before you glue so that it looks nice.
  Put the glue on the back of the board instead of the front so that it doesn't leak through the silk.  Allow that to dry.
  It should start at the corners of the silk on the back, and go diagonally.  Cut two from corner to corner.  Then, make sure that you have enough to go across the board as much as you want.  The ribbon can make any pattern you want.  Search "Memo board" on Google if you want the standard pattern and replicate it.
,  This adds a clean and finished look.
  Make it about 2 to 3 times the length of the board so that it can hang.  You can also make it the same length as the board so the ribbon is not shown.
