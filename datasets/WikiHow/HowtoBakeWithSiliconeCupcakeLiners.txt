, This method of "seasoning" the liners this way will only be needed for the first few uses.
,,


Place a cookie sheet on an even surface such as a counter top or table.






Position the silicone cupcake liners on the cookie sheet. If preferred, slip into the slots of a muffin tray.






Fill the silicone cupcake liners. Using a ladle, fill the liners two thirds of the way with the prepared cupcake batter. Some liners come with a marked fill line.



Slip the cookie sheet supporting the silicone bakeware into the oven.
Check the time. When using silicone liners for the first time, it's important to watch the cupcakes carefully, as baking times may vary slightly from your normal cookware.






Test the cupcakes to see if they're done by inserting a toothpick or skewer into a cupcake that located in the center of the cookie sheet. The cupcakes are done baking when the toothpick comes out clean.
 Use an oven mitt to hold the cookie sheet as you take it out of the oven.


Be careful. Silicone bakeware cools quickly, but it will be very hot when you first remove it.
 Once cooled, ice, serve, and enjoy your cupcakes.
 Load the liners into the dishwasher or wash by hand with warm, soapy water. Given that the silicone bakeware is made of a flexible material, you can turn the silicone bakeware inside out to easily clean the crevices.
