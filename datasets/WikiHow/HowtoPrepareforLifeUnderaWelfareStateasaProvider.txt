 Part of being a happy member of a welfare state is not expecting anyone to thank you for your dependability.;
, No one need recognize you for being responsible -- if called upon to sacrifice and this sacrifice may be shared in the welfare system, as a needed provider.
 You might choose to live in a state which does not provide many government programs, such as North Dakota, Idaho, New Hampshire, Texas or Florida, and other southern and western states. Some of these are the most affordable states to live in, and they impose the lowest taxes on their citizens. Check the Heritage Foundation for their published rankings on taxation and such.
 If you are a provider, adjust your standard of living to have less cash take home after higher taxes.
 Budget to reduce money that you currently spend on the essentials and other things. Don't buy the better foods or clothing as much as you used to because you may be unable to afford them--if you must pay for people who do not earn above the government guideline.
