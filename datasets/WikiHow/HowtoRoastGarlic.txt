If preferred, you can remove each clove individually for roasting but this is a more time-consuming method and not really necessary.
 Or use one of those great clay garlic roasters. Or, place cloves in muffin tins, drizzle oil into each garlic head, and cover entire tray with foil.

Again, if using individual cloves, add them to the package.

If using the cloves individually, drizzle oil over each one.

, Start checking at about 30-35 minutes, but it may take more like 50-55 minutes.You can also try higher heat, like 400ºF, for about 35-40 minutes.Either way, the end result should be that the skins are golden brown and the garlic cloves are tender when pierced with a knife.
 They should come out easily. Arrange on a plate or add to a dish as needed.

If roasting individual cloves, simply drop them out of the foil to where they're needed.
Serve with salt and olive oil. It also goes well with crusty bread.
