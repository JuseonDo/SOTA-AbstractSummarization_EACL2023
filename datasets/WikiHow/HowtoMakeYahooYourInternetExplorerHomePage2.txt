 This browser's icon is dark-blue with a white "e" on it.
 It's in the top-right corner of the Edge window.
 This option is near the bottom of the pop-out window.
 It's near the middle of the Settings section.
 You'll find this option in the "Open Microsoft Edge with" drop-down menu.
 Yahoo's home page URL is https://www.yahoo.com/. You should see the white "Enter a URL" box below the "Open Microsoft Edge with" section.
 It's to the right of the URL box. Doing so will save your changes.
 When it opens, you should arrive at Yahoo's home page rather than your previous home page.
