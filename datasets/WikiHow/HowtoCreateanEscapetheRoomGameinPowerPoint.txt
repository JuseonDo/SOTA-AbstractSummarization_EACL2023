 Make sure to use the same basement picture for every slide you make, or you can take various pictures around a basement from where you live, but not the same.
), then hyperlink/place in this document/click the slide where you want it to go to.
, For example, make a key, to open that door. Or better, a puzzle! Or maybe a riddle, so players go deeper into the game.
 If you wanted to make a puzzle or a riddle, get help from your parents or something or from the internet. If the key and door, let me tell you how.
 Draw up a rectangle that looks like a door. Then shapes/oval. Draw up an oval on the door. Then, select the door and then the doorknob, then press control+G. This will group the whole thing, selected.
,,, Then animation/custom animation/add effect/appear.
,, Then add another effect for the doorknob/disappear.
 Timing, triggers/start effect on/click the group key. Now when you play, hover your mouse pointer to the doorknob. The cursor won't change to a hand! Why? Then click the key. Then the doorknob that covered the group, will appear!

, To make one, Make a rectangle. Then copy and paste the group key, fitting it just right in the rectangle. Then create another rectangle, but covering the key. Then, right click/format picture/fill/solid fill/transparent it until the key looks clear enough to see. Then click the line color tab/solid line/transparent it, 100%.
 Add effect/appear/timing/triggers/on click of/the group key on the ground. Then do the same, but this time, disappear.
 Then do the same, disappearing.
