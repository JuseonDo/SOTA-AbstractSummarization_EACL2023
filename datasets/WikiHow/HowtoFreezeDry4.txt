 Spread it out so that the pieces of food are not clumped together., If possible, make sure the freezer is empty of other items.

Don't open the freezer much while the food is freezing. This will slow the freezing process, and cause ice crystals to develop on the food.
If you have a deep freezer, use it. The food should be frozen at the lowest temperature possible.
 Set the temperature to 10 °C (50 °F).

The sublimation process should be complete within a week depending on the set parameters.
Check one of the slices after waiting the proper time to make sure the freeze-drying is complete.
