 You can make many shapes out of smaller bills, or fold a larger denomination into 1 shape. Ask the bank for crisp bills or iron your bills so that they are crisp and easier to fold.;
, You may want to use a straight edge or bone folder to make the edges of your shape crisp. Every time you make a fold, run the straight edge against it to form a crease.
 Crease and open again.
 The top left of the fold should be at the mid-point crease you just made. The top right corner should hit the bottom edge of the bill at an angle.
 Line the top of the left side with the right side, forming an arrow-like figure.
,, Fold in half cross-wise. Fold the right side down similar to what you did in step 4, instead with the top right corner slightly past the bottom edge of the bill.
 This will help create a slightly larger triangle.
, Fold in half cross-wise. Fold the right side till the top edge aligns with the middle crease.
 This will create the largest triangle.
, Insert the medium triangle into the small triangle in similar fashion.
 Continue folding it until you have a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) roll of the entire width of the bill. Unroll it and refold into a box using the creases that were just made.
 Done!
