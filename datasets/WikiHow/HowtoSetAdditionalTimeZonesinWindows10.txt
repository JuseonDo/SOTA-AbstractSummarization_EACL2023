 If you are living in one time zone and work in another, you might need that second time zone information on your Windows 10 computer.;
, Although most sites talk about how it's quickest to type "date and time" into Cortana on your Windows 10 PC, as long as you are going to Control Panel from "old-school" methods (from the desktop version, and not the Settings portion of the Windows 10 Start menu), you should be alright.
 Although the time zone set here is the one that will show on your taskbar initially, sometimes this can prevent conflicts when adding other time zones. If it is incorrect, click on "Change time zone" button and adjust accordingly.
 This is where you'll find the settings for adding additional clocks.
 There are two checkboxes on this page called "Show this clock" that needs to be checked individually to enable each timezone. Work on one at a time, and you can repeat for other time zones later. Secondary time zone information should be the top time zone information set, and the tertiary info (if needed) should be the stuff on the bottom.
 There are so many, if you can't seem to find your exact time zone, you may need to ask someone which time zone you'll need.
 This can be the name of your location, or a made up explanation that doesn't give out the full name of the city (such as explanations known as "home, work"; these choices are endless. You can also leave the default values of Clock 2 and Clock 3 in these boxes if no words can best imply why these secondary time zones are set.
 Click the Apply button.
, Hover over the time in your Windows taskbar, and you'll be presented with the time zones you set from the dialog box you had open.
