 Don't drop them all at the same place splash or damage defenses will easily and quickly take out your troops.;
, You never know when there are triple bombs or giants bombs, so sprinkling allows at least some of the wizards to survive.
 Only drop rages when your giants are stuck on a wall or when your wizards are targeting the Town Hall. Heal spells are recommended because wizard towers are deadly to giants.


Note: Any other spells are not recommended.
 Heroes are not recommended for use because the giant and wizards will give you at least 2 stars but if you really want to use them, drop heroes when it's the correct time.
 If you have heroes that are 5 and up, activate their abilities.
