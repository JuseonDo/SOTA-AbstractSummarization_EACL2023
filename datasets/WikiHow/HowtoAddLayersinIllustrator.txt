,, Select "Layers" from the drop down menu. A box will appear to the right of your document that lists all the layers you have so far. If you have opened a new document it will show that you have 1 layer.
 You can also click the box next to the layer to turn layers off so that they can't be edited.
 The first box will tell you how many layers you have. Hover over the other icons and you will see what the buttons do. You should see "Create New Sublayer" and "Create New Layer" buttons. There will also be a button that pertains to masks and a delete button. Those are not needed right now.
 A new layer should pop up above your first Adobe Illustrator layer. It will be characterized by a different color, so that you can differentiate between the layers you have.
 For example, some people add symbols as a sublayer or parts of an illustration, like shading, that depend entirely on the parent layer.
 This becomes extremely important as you add more and more layers to your document.
