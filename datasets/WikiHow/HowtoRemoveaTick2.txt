 Choose a thin, unwaxed floss, or another type of thin string. This does the trick if you don't have tweezers on hand.
 The string should lie as close to the skin as possible.
 Use both hands to pull the floss taut.
 The tick's mouth will release the skin.
 Clean both the bite and your hands. Rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine can also be used to help prevent infection and the spreading of tick-borne disease.
