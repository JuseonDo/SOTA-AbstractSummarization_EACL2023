 1 inch (2.5Â cm) cubes is recommended, but large wedges or thick slices also work well.
, It's a trade off as this saves roasting time, but adds an extra stage to the cooking. It's not essential but it works well as it makes them crispier., Stir well then add potatoes. Stir again to get an even coating on the spuds. It's perfectly good if the surface of the potato gets "roughened up" as it makes them crispier. Add a little more peanut oil if the mix seems too dry for a good coating., If your oven is known for burning things, cover with foil., If you half cooked them, 20-30 minutes is all you would need, but 30-40 minutes for raw or for large wedges., When they are golden brown and cooked through (test with a skewer) then they are ready to go., See tips for extra serving of flavour suggestions.
