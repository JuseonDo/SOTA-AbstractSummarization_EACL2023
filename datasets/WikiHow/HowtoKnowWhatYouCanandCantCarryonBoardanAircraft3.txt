 You are responsible for your belongings and what's in them, so double-check pockets and compartments of clothing and bags for items that may have been forgotten about such as lighters, swiss-army knives, bottle openers, etc.
 Refer to the relevant websites to find out immediately before travelling what restrictions are in place.
 There may be exemptions for certain items such as medications, baby formula, breast milk, and certain foods. You can declare these items but should know that officers may need to conduct additional screening which can take longer.
