 Squeeze out some of the water so that it doesn't drip.
 Put it directly on the center of the sponge.
 Use a finger to rub it into the sponge. The baking soda will absorb water. Rub the baking soda and add more water if needed until you have a thick white paste on the sponge.
 Use a medium amount of pressure.
 If the sponge starts to dry out before all the crayon is gone, wet it and add more baking soda.
 Use a damp cloth, paper towel, or sponge to wipe away any leftover baking soda from the wall.
 Use a dry cloth or paper towel to dry the wall completely.
