@summary
many men would like to look like the fitness models you see on tv and in the magazines.

@summary
to help you answer the first question, i gladly refer you to the following documentary "i wanna look like that guy".

@summary
as for the second question; you must realize that the guys with the rock hard bodies you see on tv and in the magazines have that body only for some period.

@summary
once you know the truth about how to be that muscular, and you are still willing to go for it you may proceed.

@article
 Before you start however, you will need to answer 2 questions.


Are you willing to pay the price for it.
Do you actually realize what you want.;
, During the documentary, the guy transforms himself from a chubby man into a true fitness model. It is a film without the nonsense products. It will show you what it takes to really become a fitness male model.
 There is nobody out there who is able to maintain a status of "great shape" for a long period. This is due to the fact that you will need to have a dangerously low fat percentage to look muscular, workout hard, eat well and take supplements. Something a human can not keep up with all his life.
