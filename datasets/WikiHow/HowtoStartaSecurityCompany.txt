 Unless you've worked in law enforcement, you will need to gain work experience in the security field before you can start a security company.


Most jurisdictions require you to have both a security guard's certification and license as well as a private patrol operator's license if you're starting a security company.
Find out which training courses are accepted by your state. Security guard training can be offered by state programs and private trade schools. Usually, you'll need to have a clean record and demonstrate adequate experience to qualify for a private patrol operator's license.;
, It usually takes between 6 and 8 months to get your certification.
 Your local law enforcement agency can tell you which boot camps are acceptable.
 A minimum of 12 months is recommended, depending on your country of residence.
 Though this is not mandatory, it is helpful to have a sound understanding of criminal law in your jurisdiction so you know how to act and react in every professional situation.
 In the United States, this is the Department of Consumer Affairs, but in other countries this may be different.
,,,, Use mailings, flyers, social networking and face-to-face meetings to advertise your services.
 Make sure all contracts are signed and each party understands exactly what his rights and obligations are in order to avoid problems and confusion later.
