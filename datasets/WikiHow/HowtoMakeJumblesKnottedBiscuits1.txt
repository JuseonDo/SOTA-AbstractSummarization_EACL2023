 Beat well to combine.;
, Add the caraway or aniseed next and stir through.
 Stir until it forms a stiff dough.
 Use the same flour that you used for making the dough. Add the dough to the work surface and knead well.
 Cut off lengths measuring around 10cm or 4 inches.
 Take two lengths and twist them by wrapping one length around and around the other length. There is no need to do anything fancier than this, although you could shape it into a knot as well, if you're confident.
 This will stop them from coming apart during cooking.
 Bring to the boil. While it is coming to the boil, prepare the cookie sheets by lining them with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350ºC/180ºC in readiness for baking after the boiling.
 Don't add too many at once, as you need to keep an eye on them and get them out quickly once cooked.
 Allow to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, then lift out with a slotted spoon and place on a tea towel draped plate. They will drain while on the tea towel.
 Place in the preheated oven to bake.
 After this time, turn them over with the spatula and allow to cook for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until they turn a golden colour.
 Allow to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then either serve warm or allow to cool just slightly more.
 These can be eaten warm or cool but they're best eaten when warm. They should be enjoyed on the day of baking; they toughen up after a day or two.
