 You need to have your business card on hand, and give it out whenever possible, to make it useful. Many people make the mistake of leaving their business card in their office, and only giving it to current customers.
 Many coffee shops, bookstores and restaurants have boards to list local events. Begin marketing your small business by placing them on these boards, wherever you can find them.
 Give a portion of your business cards to other businesses, freelancers or customers. Offer to give them a percentage of the sales if they refer someone to your businesses.


One way that they can do this is to include a coupon code on the card. Create a different code for each affiliate. This code will track how many sales each affiliate marketer gets, and you can give a referral bonus or percentage using those coupon-based sales.
 You never know who will be looking at your card and who will keep it.
 Tape it to the product and encourage the client to go to your website and review their transaction. Good reviews can increase sales for your small business, and you can moderate bad reviews on your website.


Keep in mind that it is not beneficial to only list bad reviews. People expect for there to be some bad with the good. Only moderate the bad reviews that are inconsistent with what actually took place, or are given by people not listed as customers.
 Choose businesses that work with the same demographic and exchange business cards. They can be affiliate marketers, or simply keep them at the front of their store.
 If the business card carries an important offer, people are more likely to keep it and refer to it.
 Check out a few books and then place them in the plastic pocket at the front or back or in the middle of the book. It may be used as a bookmark or you may find a new customer.
 They serve as a tag and can be saved.
