@summary
if you don't have time to teach your pet tricks, but still want them to learn, call an obedience trainer.

@summary
to teach your pet a behavior, they must do something such as sniffing sims, sleeping in the pet bed, sleeping in the sim bed, or peeing on the floor.
@article
 There are many different options, such as sit, roll over, and more. Click one, and your Sim will start to teach the pet a trick. A bar will appear above its head as it's learning. After it fills up, the pet has learned the trick.;
, On the phone, click "Service", then "Obedience Trainer". When the trainer comes, click on her and choose "Purchase Training For ( pet's name)."You will have to pay 25 simoleons per session, and 75 an hour. The pet will be taught until 9 P.M., or when their needs drop too low.
 These things can be good or bad. If you like what they are doing, have your Sim click on the pet, then "Praise for..." to encourage that behavior. If you dislike the pet's action, do the same thing, but click "Scold for..." to discourage that behavior. As you continue to praise or scold your pet, they will begin to get an understanding of what to do. For example, if you scold your pet for eating pet food, they'll eat Sim food instead.
