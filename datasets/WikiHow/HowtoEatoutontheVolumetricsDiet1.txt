 You can sometimes ask the chef to prepare your dish in a more healthful way, such as grilling the dish with a small amount of butter or oil instead of pan-frying.;
, Chicken noodle, minestrone, vegetable and beef barley are common choices that are broth-based, which means that you can have larger portions.
, Many dishes are available in smaller portions that will still make you feel full.
 Make sure that vegetables arenâ€™t covered with oil or sauce and request steamed vegetables when possible.
, If the chef is unwilling to accommodate you, then ask the server to recommend lighter dishes.
, Inquire whether your server can split the meal and wrap half of it before it comes to your table.
