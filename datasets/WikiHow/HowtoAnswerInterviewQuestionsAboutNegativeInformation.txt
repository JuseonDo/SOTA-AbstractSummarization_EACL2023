Be prepared, too, for questions like "Why did you leave?", especially if there is negative information as part of the answer.;
, You can have the ideas in mind without coming across as having rehearsed a speech. Know what you will discuss and how.
 That is, if the job uses your computer skills heavily, don't choose your computer skills as the weakness you talk about. Choose subjects that are relevant but less important.
 Start with something positive (and related), state the negative information succinctly without dwelling on it, and then end with another positive.
 This could be a skill that you're good at or something you liked about a company, person, or job.
 Don't dwell on it, blame anybody, or overstate the problem.
 The best positive you could possibly state is how you dealt with the problem or difficulty, what you learned from the experience, or how you worked to improve matters.
 Describe how your efforts resulted in money saved, better communication, or some other solution to the problem, end on that note. This is similar to the "SAR" (situation, action, result) or "PSR" (problem, solution, result) technique used in behavioral interviewing.
