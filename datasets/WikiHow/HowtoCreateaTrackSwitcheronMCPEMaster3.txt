 Any passive mobs can stay.
 They should connect, and no rail should be going up/down hill.
 If the track is vertical make the blocks horizontal and vice versa.
 One of the pieces will curve.
 This can not be a diagonal touch, only a strait on.
 When you do the track will switch. It will stay like this until flipped again.
