 For a great example, see How to cover a paperback book with junk mail.
 Cut out the fun pictures and use to decoupage boxes, old suitcases (for funky storage), old bottles (for vases), etc.


Make decoupage pictures or collages using shreds of junk mail catalogs.
Open the flap of junk mail envelopes to make a house shape. Glue to paper, design windows and doors, a chimney and you have instant house designs to create fun art with.
 See How to make paper snowflakes for more details.
 Punch out lots of junk mail catalogs. Use any shapes but circles work as well as any other shapes. Thread them onto a string tightly until you have the length required. Knot to close. Wear and enjoy the feel of junk mail as art.
 For ideas, see How to make a paper flower bouquet and How to make a paper flower.
 See How to make a paper wallet for one idea.
 You can weave junk mail into baskets, boxes, wallets, bags and more. It will look a lot better than it did as junk mail.
