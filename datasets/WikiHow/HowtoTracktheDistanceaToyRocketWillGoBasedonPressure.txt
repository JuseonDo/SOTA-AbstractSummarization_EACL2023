 They're available from most toy and outdoor stores.;
, Follow the rocket's directions and use a large, open space (preferably a parking lot).
 Use chalk and a tape measure to measure about 40 feet (12.2Â m) in length across the parking lot.
 Take the rocket to the "0" mark of the line drawn in chalk, and set it up on its side so that the rocket is parallel to the ground. You may use a notebook or binder to hold up the platform of the rocket to ensure that it is parallel to the ground.
 Start by deciding on one person to complete every trial, so that the weight is the same. This person will start by firmly stepping one foot on the pump for the rocket to launch horizontally across the parking lot.
 This person will watch to see where the rocket hits the ground and mark that spot each time.
 Mark where each one lands with a 1.
 Then you'll have 5 trials for stepping on the foot pump.
 On these trials, he should stomp harder.
 He or she should put a 2 on the spot where the rocket hits the ground each time.
 Do 5 more trials like this, with the increased force on the pump.
