@summary
find out what kind of books they like.

@summary
buy around 10 books of their choice.

@summary
a collector would also love it if you can find a rare book, maybe a first or second print edition.

@summary
once you have your books in place, buy a nice basket.

@summary
at the base of the basket (if it's not a stiff material) put in a piece of cardboard.

@summary
put some confetti or coloured bits of paper and add them at the bottom.

@summary
,

@summary
put the books inside the basket, the way you would put them in shelves.

@summary
now take a big sheet of transparent paper (coloured/patterned/plain), big enough to cover your whole basket.

@summary
wrap your entire basket in it and tie it on the top with a cute ribbon.

@summary
watch the book lover's smile as they receive their favourite gift.

@article
 If they like religious books, search online about what kind of books have recently been released on that particular subject.;
, If you want to give them an entire range of books, buy a few comic books (they always work), a few books which have made it to the best seller lists, and a self help book or so. And you can also include a gift coupon of a book store along with it. If you know they like gardening or cooking, include some hobby books. If they are the sort who would like to mix drinks, add a book about cocktails and mocktails.
 Or you can try to find the entire volume of a particular series, or maybe the entire works of an author.
 It can be a cute re-usable wicker/cane basket or some canvas material basket in which they can store other things later. Make sure that the width of the basket is as much as the width of the book.
 Book lovers are known for the meticulous way in which they like the books being kept (more often than not) so make sure you present it well.
, Don't lay the book in spine-up. Though it means that the person won't be able to read the titles of the books immediately, it's alright. You don't want to spoil the books in the gifting process.
 A gauzy piece of fabric will also do.
 However, make sure that the person who you are presenting this whole set to can understand that these are books!
