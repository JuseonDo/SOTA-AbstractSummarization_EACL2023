 Using one with molded cups and padding helps hide your extra stuffing.
 It should be about twice the size of your bra cup.
 The folded piece should be about the size of your bra cup.


If it's too large, pieces will stick out and give your secret away. Trim off a bit at the end.
 Repeat this step on the other side.


Use one piece of tissue per cup. If you add more, they're more likely to bunch up and ruin your silhouette.
If you're not satisfied with the amount of boost, try thicker tissues or 3- or 4-ply toilet paper.



If it looks uneven, go back to the beginning and repeat with a fresh tissue.
 Tissues are not the material of choice, since they absorb and hold moisture from perspiration, losing their shape and making you uncomfortable. However, this method will work if you're in a bind.
