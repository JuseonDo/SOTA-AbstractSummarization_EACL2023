 Watching the Star Wars series in the chronologically correct order provides the audience with a broad overview of the Sith Lord, Darth Vader's childhood, and early adulthood. When watching the series in the chronologically correct order, the audience can truly grasp Darth Vader's character, watching him grow from a young slave, to a young padawan, to a jedi, to a sith lord. It also provides back-stories for characters such as Obi Wan, Yoda, R2D2, C3PO, and Darth Sidious.
