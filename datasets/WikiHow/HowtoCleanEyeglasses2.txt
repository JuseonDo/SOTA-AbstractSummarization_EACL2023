, Swish them around.
 Let the running tap water wash off the washing up liquid. Rotate the glasses so the water can get to both sides of the lenses with the same strength.
 Fold the cloth so that it's on both sides of the lens at once. Place your thumb over the half of the cloth that's on the inside part of the lens and your index and middle finger over the half on the outside. Move your fingers/thumb from left to right like you're asking somebody for money. Apply mild force to your fingers like you're clicking them in slow motion. Repeat with the other lens.
, Before using the dry side of the cloth to dry. Make sure you dry the glasses with the cloth in a similar way to cleaning them with the damp side. Only this time move your fingers in an alternating circular motion instead of from side to side. Use another cotton bud to dry the bits that are hard to reach.
 If there is still something left behind, repeat the process
