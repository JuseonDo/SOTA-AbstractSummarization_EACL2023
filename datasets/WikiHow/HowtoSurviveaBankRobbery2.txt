, It is important to keep the details fresh in your mind. By discussing the incident, you may forget important details.
 In the bank, the bankers will separate you from the other people in the bank so they can get an individual statement from you. You will receive a red folder with a description form. Try to remember as clear as you can the details of the robbery.
 Before you leave the bank, be sure to have the description folder completely filled out and sent in.
 They may ask you to testify before court or ask you for other details to help recover lost property.



If you fought back in self defense and injured or killed the robber, then get an attorney.
