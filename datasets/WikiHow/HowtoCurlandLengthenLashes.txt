 Grab your hairdryer and turn it on to it's hottest setting. Then, hold your blow dryer to the eyelash curler for a couple of seconds. Since your eye lash curler is hot, it will be more effective.
 Start at the root of your lashes, and hold for a couple of seconds. Then, move the lash curler to the middle of your lashes and hold for another couple of seconds. Do the same to the tips of the lashes. Repeat with the other eye.
 When applying, slightly move the wand back and forth. This will avoid clumps and apply the mascara evenly.
