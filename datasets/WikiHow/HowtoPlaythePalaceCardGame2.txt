@article
 Each player must have at least 3 cards in their hand at all times during the game. If you don't have 3 cards in your hand you have to pick one up from the face down deck.
 The order of the cards from least to greatest goes 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, Jack, Queen, King, Ace. You are allowed to play multiple of the same card as long as it beats the previous card and if all four of a card are played consecutively then the whole pile is burned. If you cannot beat the current card then you can either pick up the pile or take a chance by seeing if the top card in the deck beats the current card. If it doesn't then you have to take the pile as well as that top card.
 If you play a two card you can then play another card in your hand (reset). If you play a ten card then all the cards in the pile are put into the burn pile never to be seen again until the game is over of course. Then you get to play another card of your choice. Also, if you place down a seven, you can chose to go up or down. (clear)

, Then once those cards are gone you then have to pick randomly one at a time from the 3 face down cards.
