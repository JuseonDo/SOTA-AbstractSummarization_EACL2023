 These are the colors of water. Buy blue food, green clothes, purple eyeshadow, tan shoes, yellow books, orange drinks and white sheets if you like.;
, Sometimes you can drink fruit juices.
 Or, wear tight tops and bottoms. Wear ballet flats that are also blue and white.
 For your school uniform, wear a collared shirt in the suggested colors, navy bottoms, flats, and ocean themed accessories. Wear your clothes tight or loose. Stick to your school dress code.
, Or, don't wear any makeup at all. Wear mascara, lipgloss, tinted moisturizer, and concealer if you wish. Water Talent Fairies are know to use these items. They get them from Pixie Boots the Chemist.
 Cleanse, exfoliate, tone, and moisturize. Put on lotion and exfoliate your body daily. Scent your body with ocean, fruit, and flower perfume. Smell briny if you like.
 Your room/s should have arts or pictures of beautiful water. Your walls can be blue, your bedding should have water-like prints and if you do have a rug, make it white. Or, you can make an underwater world. Have yellow or blue walls, brown carpet, fish mobiles, plush underwater creatures, and a treasure box filled with seaweed, fish, gold, pearls, and jewels.
 Be "go with the flow". Don't worry what people think about you and what you wear. It's just you being you.
 The glitter shouldn't be chunky. Have a jar of glitter and when your on the go, bring a pack full of it. You could sprinkle glitter everywhere.
 If having nappy hair, do it natural and make your hair an afro. You can also put glitter on your face and in your hair.
, You could say 'swishy' instead of 'great, cool, sure, and awesome'. You could also say 'splashtastic' instead of 'fantastic'.
