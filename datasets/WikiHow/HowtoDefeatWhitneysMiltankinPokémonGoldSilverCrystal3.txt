@summary
capture a gastly and have it learn curse.

@summary
use curse against her miltank.

@summary
attack and/or status the miltank while it's under the curse.
@article
 Curse will cut down Gastly's HP in exchange for a curse that damages the opposing Pok√©mon every turn.
 Stomp won't affect your Gastly, so if your Gastly is female, Miltank will have to resort to Rollout, which will be unlikely to KO your Gastly on the first turn.
 Eventually, Miltank should go down to a combination of your attack damage and the damage from the curse.
