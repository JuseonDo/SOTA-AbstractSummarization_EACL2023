 You can use a hand-held mixer or a food processor fitted with a whisk attachment. You can also do it with a wooden spoon, but it will take longer.For a less sweet cinnamon butter, use 1 cup (225 grams) of butter instead., Use a low-speed setting, and occasionally scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. This will ensure that everything mixes evenly.


For a less sweet cinnamon butter, omit the confectioner's sugar. The extra butter you added earlier will make up for the missing sugar.,, A couple of 4-ounce (120 milliliters) or half-pint (240 milliliters) mason jar would be ideal.Try to use a container made out of glass (as opposed to plastic) to best preserve the flavor.
 It will last in the fridge for 5 to 6 months.It is perfect for sweet rolls, toast, scones, or even muffins.
