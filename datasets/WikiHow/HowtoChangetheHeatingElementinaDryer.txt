,, On the right side, you'll see a long metal (probably gray) housing. The Element is inside.
, (These two sensors could be your problem (in 50% of the cases, it is). Also, there is a heating fuse to your left, under the larger casing on the left. It is about an inch long, and has two wires attached. This can also be your problem. One screw holds it in. If in doubt, take all these to the appliance store, and they'll test them with a voltmeter.)

, It should easily come loose. If not, lift a little harder and pull the bottom toward you. There may be a screw and small bracket at the top that needs to be removed. There are some hooks on the bottom that will come loose.
 Take out the screw, and carefully pull out the element, which is a coil that heats up, on some metal housing. Examine the coil for breaks. If you have a voltmeter, test the element. Also test the Sensors. This will tell you what's broken.
 Replace the element, replace all the sensors and the back panel, as well as the exhaust hose. When done, try it out!
