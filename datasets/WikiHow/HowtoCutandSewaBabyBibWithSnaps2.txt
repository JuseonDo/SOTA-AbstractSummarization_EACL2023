 Start sewing onto the line you've drawn with your fabric pen. Use a small, straight stitch.

Start at the outside edge of your 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap and sew around the perimeter of the bib until you reach the other end of the gap. Make sure you leave the gap open.
, Be careful to cut across the corner fabric but not the thread. This small snip will make the corners turn more easily., If you are having troubles pulling it through with your fingers, use a knitting needle to gather and pull fabric through the gap.

Reach the needle into the clipped corners to ensure you turn the flaps completely flat.
 Press the bib flat with an iron., Make sure you pin the neck loop so that the terry cloth does peak out slightly, or it will not be sewn properly., Pin it in place around the perimeter., Do a small, 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance, so that your gap will be closed in the process., Center 1 side of the snap on the back of 1 of your flaps. Place it approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from the end of the flap., Use a complimentary thread color. Use clean stitches around the perimeter of the snap and knot the thread.,
