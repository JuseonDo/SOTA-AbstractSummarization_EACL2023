, These will be regarded as incentives, and will not only give your child the false idea that she shall be rewarded at all times, but with food especially this will only cause bad and irregular eating habits such as eating too much or not eating on time. Instead, as a parent, be firm about teaching moral values.
 Children are known to be picky about their vegetables, but sometimes a little artfulness in the presentation, or making a variation (like adding cheese to broccoli) can make eating fun!

, This will only give your child the license to take and consume as much as she wants.
 You are still the parent, therefore you still have control over your child’s meals even outside the house.
 Teach her that eight glasses a day is healthy, but don’t be too pushy about it. Let her get the hang of it on her own, and never tire of reminding her every now and then.
 Put a limit to TV and computer or video game time. Show her that there are other fun stuff to do outside of the house and not just in the virtual world. Watch sports shows with her, and try enrolling her in swimming classes, baseball training and the like. If your child is exhibiting an interest in any one sport, take her up on it, and do not forget to follow-through – you have to show you’re as interested as she is so that she doesn’t lose her enthusiasm.
 Teach her not to dwell on failures and bad sides, but to focus on her good qualities instead. Teach her to have faith in her abilities, but do not be too emphatic or she might feel pressure. Set a harmonious balance between praise and criticism – do not overdo either. This sort of training will help prevent “comfort eating” in the future.
 You can hardly point your child in the right direction when it comes to healthy eating habits if you do not practice them yourself.
