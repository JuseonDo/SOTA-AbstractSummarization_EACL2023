 This icon is of a folder being opened. This program comes standard on many Windows computers and is a quick and easy way to get a GIF. You must, however, use a .AVI movie file, which is a Microsoft-specific codec.If you don't have it, you can download MS GIF Animator for free online., The program will now read the individual frames from the video. This may take a while if you have a large video. If you are attempting to take a small part from a large video, cut the video to only that part before opening it in MS GIF Animator.
 These images show you the different frames of your video as you scroll down, like a flipbook. If you click the Play button, your video should play. It may not be the speed you'd like yet, but this can be changed.
 Select all frames by clicking the Select All button. This is the button with three squares on it. Click the Animation tab, select Looping, and set how many times you want it to loop. Select forever if you want it to loop continuously.
 Every time you change the duration, play it again and see what it looks like. Generally, 2-6 works well, but depending on the frame rate of your video you may need more or even less.
 This is the icon with multiple floppy disks. Save your GIF wherever you would like.
