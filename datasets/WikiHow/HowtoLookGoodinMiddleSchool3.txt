 If you decide that you like the cologne that suits you, but it's too strong, spray it once or twice, at the most. A good method is to spray it in front of you, then step into the "cloud".
 Your pants shouldn't expose your underwear. It isn't attractive and is most likely against your school's dress code.
 Don't be mean to them if you really like them. They hate that, it annoys them and it doesn't make them think that you are cool.
 It doesn't make you look cool.
 It isn't attractive and you will look like a wannabe.
