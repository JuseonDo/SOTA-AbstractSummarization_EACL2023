Jaguars are British-assembled, they are now part of the Indian subsidiary company Tata Motors. The company was founded in 1922 under the name Swallow Sidecar Company. The name of the company was changed from Swallow Sidecar Company to Jaguar following World War II because of the stigma of the initials SS.






While under the Swallow Sidecar name, the first models were the SS 90 and SS 100.






Their earlier vehicles include 1949's XK 120, which evolved into the XK 140 and XK 150. Also notable is the XKE from 1961 and 1948's streamlined Mark V and the XK120 sports car from that same year.

Browse through the newspaper classified section. Start with the personal car ads and move on to the dealership ads to begin your search.






Visit the online websites of local dealerships. Most put their newest inventory in their prints ads, but you can generally find almost the entire stock posted on their online site.
 You can typically find the magazines at convenience stores or gas stations located in racks by the door.


Visit the AntiqueCar.com Jaguar listings at http://www.antiquecar.com/index/listings/category784.htm. Use the site to check out photos, different models, prices and years.






Look at http://www.antiquecarsite.net/Antique-Classic-Cars/Vintage-Jaguars, which is another website to find classic Jaguars.






Search the British site http://www.carandclassic.co.uk/cat//22/ to find your next Jaguar purchase.






Try searching AutoTraderClassics.com as another alternative. You can set your year range, price range, as well as how far you are willing to travel to locate the right Jaguar for your collection.
, Make a fair initial offer, but don't be afraid to haggle if price is that large of a concern for you.
 Determine if the seller is planning to ship the vehicle to you by truck or by sea, if you will have someone else drive you there to retrieve it, or if you will fly or take a train to that destination and then drive it home.
