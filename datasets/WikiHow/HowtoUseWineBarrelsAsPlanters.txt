 If you don’t have an electric drill, inquire at the local hardware store or lumberyard about handyman services. For a nominal fee, some establishments will perform small jobs such as drilling or sawing, especially if you purchased the item from them.;
, It is not necessary to line the sides of the barrel with the cloth. Empty the entire bag of stones into the barrel and spread them evenly over the cloth.
 Add ½ cup of Osmocote and with your trowel, mix it thoroughly into the soil.
 Check the labels for height and width potential of mature plants. But bear in mind, a plant growing in confined quarters doesn’t have the freedom to stretch its roots the way it could if it were planted in open ground. If you are satisfied with how your design appears, remove plants from their pots and insert in soil.
 Moist soil on the top doesn’t mean that the entire container has received the water it needs in order to become a thriving, healthy and productive garden.
