 Have a look at some pictures of Sacha Baron Cohen dressed as Bruno to get the idea. Anything animal print, suggestive, PVC and generally tabooed is good.;
, Don't be afraid to walk like a ponce! If you are, then this is how it's done.
 Bruno is actually Austrian, however the difference between accents is very small. Pronounce "w" as "v", "r" as "w", say "Ich" instead of "I", say "mein" instead of "mine", on words ending with "s" put "sch" on the end and instead of saying "the" say "ze". There are probably a few more, watch Bruno, or some interviews to get a good idea. There is also a section on the official website, called "Discover Brunoisms". I strongly suggest you check this out.
 Remember, Bruno is a stereotype, so don't be afraid to use them. Just be careful of actually offending someone too much, even Sacha Baron Cohen has his limits.
, In the film, Bruno's ultimate aim is to achieve worldwide fame, and is pretty much obsessed with it.
, Be really sarcastic to everyone about everything. However, if someone criticizes your talent, confront them.
 Hence, make a big entrance wherever you go and expect people to know who you are.
 European Dance bands and DJ's are good, such as Scooter (a lot of their music is in the film) and Basshunter, but anything goes!
