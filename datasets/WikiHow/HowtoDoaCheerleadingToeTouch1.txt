 stretching will help you get a perfect toe touch. Make sure you stretch out your ankles and legs. Go in a straddle position and lean further and further each time.;
, It will help you snap back down and force you to go higher.
, Make sure you know what kind of prep you are doing. You can do one that is a high V, cross down in a X by your knees or you can do a clap prep. Hit your prep tight!

, When you point your toes it will make your jump cleaner and prettier.
 It's important to snap back down because it makes it clean and it's required to do so you don't look sloppy when you go back down.
 It's important to practice it because you will see lots of improvement!
