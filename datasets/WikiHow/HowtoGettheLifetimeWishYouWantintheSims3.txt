 There are 32 lifetime wishes available for your sim, listed in the table below. There are much more traits than wishes. If you pick the traits first, it will narrow down the list of Lifetime Wishes for you.;
, Pick one or two of these traits for your sim.

(Note: Do not pick too many traits that are linked to another lifetime wish you want, or that ones might push your desired wish down the priority table).
 If they do not, reroll your wishes a couple times.


To reroll your Lifetime Wishes available, enter the trait selection screen and hit cancel.






If the desired lifetime wish does not show up, switch one trait for one more trait linked to the main wish.






If it still doesn't show up, go to 'Choose Lifetime Wish.' If you know the name of the wish, scroll down until you find it.
