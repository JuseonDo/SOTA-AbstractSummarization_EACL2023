 Lime will compliment the other flavors in the drink. Just make that you only get the green part of the lime skin when you zest. The white is bitter and unpalatable., Before the final blend, add only 1 cup of water and then add 1 cup of milk of your choosing.,, Use 1/3 cup of rice, plus 1 cup of blanched and skinned almonds. Grind the rice separately, then add the almonds, cinnamon, and 3 cups of hot water, and allow the mixture to sit overnight. Proceed to blend and strain the mixture as normal.
