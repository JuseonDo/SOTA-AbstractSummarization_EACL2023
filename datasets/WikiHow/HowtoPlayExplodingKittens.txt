 Divide them into piles of the Exploding Kittens, the Defuse, and the rest of the cards. There should be 4 Exploding Kittens and 6 Defuses.
 The game is meant for up to 5 people.,,
Put 2 Exploding Kittens in the pile with the rest of the cards if you're playing with 3 people.
Put 3 Exploding Kittens in the pile with the rest of the cards if you are playing with 4 people.
Put 4 Exploding Kittens in the pile with the rest of the cards if you are playing with 5 people.
 Only put 2 in the deck if you are playing with 2 people.,, When it is your turn you can play as many cards as you want, placing them in a pile next to the deck. When you end your turn, you draw a card., When you use a Defuse card you get to put the Exploding Kitten anywhere in the deck.
The Favor card means the person who played the card picks any opponent to give them a card of the opponent's choice.
The Nope card can be used any time during the game to stop any action except against an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse card.
An Attack card forces the next player to go twice, and you don't need to draw a card at the end of your turn.
The Skip card lets you skip your turn without drawing a card.
The Shuffle card lets you shuffle the deck.

Cat cards aren't useful by themselves but can be used in Special Combos or Pairs.

If you have triples (Three of a Kind) of a card with no instructions you get to ask any opponent for any card. If they do not have theÂ card you ask for you get nothing. If they do you get to keep that card.

In Advanced Play, any two or three cards with matching icons in their corners can be played as pairs, rather than only instruction-less cards. And if you have five cards with different icons in the corners (with or without instructions) then you can look through the Discard Pile and grab any card you want.
 The game is won when all but one players have "exploded", or drawn an Exploding Kittens card. The last player left is declared the winner. Have fun!
