build four wheels by gluing two 1x6 boards to each other (with perpendicular grain direction).

 The platform shown in the illustrations is about 18 inches (45.7cm) wide and 24 inches (60cm) long, but you can modify the size easily to fit your needs.
 Then scribe a circle on them, and cut them out with a jigsaw or bandsaw. Drill a 1/2 inch (1.2cm) hole in the center of each for the mounting bolts (described later).
