 If he is online simply say "hey" but make sure you don't always start the conversation though let him sometimes.;
,", unless he says "what about you?". Then simply say you are fine or nothing much is really going on.
 It's over the internet... not even face to face, it's very simple and don't freak out.
 Laugh at his jokes even when they aren't funny. Guys like that.
 Maybe he's a music lover, ask him his fave song. Or sports type, ask him his fave team. You get the idea.
 Nothing going on? Ask about homework if he goes to your school. If he goes to a different school then say your friend had mentioned that he is funny and you two could be great friends.
 Make sure he is single though.
 Make sure he likes you before you ever mention a word of you liking him.
 Always make it in person. Unless you can't.
 But don't try too hard and don't laugh at everything he says. Especially if he's being serious.
 If you don't trust yourself, how can he?
