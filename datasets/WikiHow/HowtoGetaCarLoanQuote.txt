Start with TransUnion and Equifax. Those companies allow you to obtain your free annual credit report.
Consider upgrading your credit reporting service to one that offers analysis of your credit rating. This will give you greater insight as to how loan officers will look at your scores and credit history.;
, If there are no disputes, and you are satisfied with your report, proceed to researching potential banks or other lending institutions.
, Allow yourself enough time between appointments, generally a few hours, to ensure that you give yourself ample time to fill out paperwork and talk to the bank representative.
, Take your time, and thoroughly fill out each line and section.
 The time it takes for a lending institution to let you know an answer will depend on the establishment.
, Financing is always available through the dealerships themselves, so you can go through the pre-approval process at as many car lots as you would like. You will get an idea as to how competitive each can be against the other and versus the banks and other lending institutions.
