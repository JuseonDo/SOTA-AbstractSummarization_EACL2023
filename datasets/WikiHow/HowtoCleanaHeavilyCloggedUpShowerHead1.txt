understand why the clogging has happened.

unscrew the swivel ball nut that holds the shower head to the mounting collar.

@summary
before you disassemble the shower head, make a note of how it went together.

@summary
completely immerse the disassembled parts in white vinegar or a lime cleaning solution.

@summary
if, after soaking, you discover that some areas still need some attention, scrub stubborn deposits with a small wire brush or the straightened end of a paper clip.

use the diagram to reassemble the shower head.

 Mineral deposits collect in the fine mesh and holes of the shower head's screening material and disk, disrupting water flow. This usually consists of hardened lime and particulate matter.;
, Then remove it. The internal parts will come apart easily, but getting the shower head off the pipe may require a wrench.
 This will let you know how to reassemble it once the parts have been cleaned. The washer will seat with a specific orientation, so be sure to note which way it was turned. Draw a diagram of the parts and where they go, to ensure you don't forget (take a digital photo of this diagram and you'll always be able to find it for each subsequent clean).
 If you see a large buildup of lime, heat the vinegar in the microwave beforehand until it's hot to the touch. The cleaning process will probably take five or six hours, so plan on performing the repair when the shower won't be needed. Most of the lime will dissolve, although there may be residue caught in the screen's mesh, embedded in the threads, and in the small holes around the disk.
 Soak the parts again for a few minutes and rinse.
 Apply silicone grease to the threads. Turn the water on and inspect for leaks. In order to keep the shower head flowing freely, plan on making this a yearly chore. This procedure will also work on faucets, toilets, and your refrigerator's water dispenser. If you can't immerse an object in vinegar, saturate a cloth and wrap it around the area you want to clean.
