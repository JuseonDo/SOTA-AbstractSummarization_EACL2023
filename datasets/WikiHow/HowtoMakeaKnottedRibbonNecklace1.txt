 This necklace will work well with most types of ribbon, except for fabrics that won't hold a knot in place well. Narrow ribbon will produce small and indistinct knots, while wider ribbon will produce larger, more distinctive knots.;
, You'll need the length that you want the ribbon to sit around your neck, plus half that length again, to allow space for making the knots.
, Don't pull it tightly though.
 Again, don't pull if you are going to make more knots.
,, Decorate with additional elements if wished; for example, you might like to use little ribbon bows (glue or stitch these in place).
