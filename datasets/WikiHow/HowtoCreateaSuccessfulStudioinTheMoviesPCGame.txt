,, Make sure you use up as little space as possible, i.e. don't put the "wild west street" smack in the middle of the studio lot. Make sure to put in roads and have it looking nice.
 Make longer ones have an actual story; create movies you've watched like "Star Wars" and "James Bond" or make up your own make army movies like "Saving Private Bryan".
