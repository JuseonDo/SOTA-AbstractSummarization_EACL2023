 Do not use your good, jewelry wire cutters; they are much too delicate. Use pair of heavy duty ones instead. Memory wire is hard, and it can easily dull a good pair of wire cutters., Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of round-nose pliers. Twist the wire around the top of the pliers to form a loop, then pull the pliers out. Use the plies to squeeze the loop smaller, if needed. This will hold the beads in place and prevent them from sliding off the end of the wire.
 You can use different shapes, sizes, and colors of beads, or just one type for something simple. You can even use a different type of bead on each coil.


Don't cover the entire wire with beads. Leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) tail at the end..
Small beads, such as bicorns and seed beads work great for memory wire bracelets. Avoid using any large, chunky beads, especially towards the end, as they might slide past the loops.
 Pinch the end of the wire with your round-nose pliers, and wrap the wire around it to form a loop. Pull the pliers out, and use them to pinch the loop smaller, if necessary.
 Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pull apart a jump ring. Slip a charm onto the jump ring, then place the ring where you want it on the bracelet. Use the needle-nose pliers to close the ring. Great places to put charms include at either end of the bracelet, or in the middle between two beads.
