 This can be done by removing the battery quickly, or by pulling out the tab which lets you set the time on a watch.;
, Say like if it was 07:45:12, set it to 07:46 on the physical clock.
 Replace the battery quickly, or quickly push the watch tab back in.
 With this single clock synced to the computer, simply take this clock and use it to do the same with all the other clocks you own, replacing the computers time with the time from your first synced clock.
