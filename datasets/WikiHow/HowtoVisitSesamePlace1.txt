 This will save you time when you arrive at the park - you won't have to wait in any queues at the ticket offices!;
, Try previewing each ride on YouTube, or take a peak at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. Although some of the bigger rides have on-ride footage, there may be a few short snippets of others that exist that may just give you enough of a glimpse of the attraction (more-so plays as the entertainment option than the rides that this happens for). This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit.
, You are usually allowed in through the barriers before opening, however you won't have access to most rides. Getting through the barriers early will give you time to pick up a park map and plan your route to the first ride of the day.
