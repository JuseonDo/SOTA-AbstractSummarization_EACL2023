 If possible, go even bolder by painting each nail a different color.;
, Although you will be applying a clear topcoat, preserve your manicure by using strong polish for the details.
 Make sure the base coat is fully dry before you attempt to design your skull. Also, while you can get away with only one coat, consider painting two base coats for a stronger manicure.
 You’ll want your skulls to be looking outward instead of at you.
 One way to approach this is to paint two small slanted ovals side by side with the ends touching each other.
 If you don’t have a brush try using a toothpick or even the tip of a dried out felt tip pen.
 If you add the top coat too soon your skulls will smudge.
