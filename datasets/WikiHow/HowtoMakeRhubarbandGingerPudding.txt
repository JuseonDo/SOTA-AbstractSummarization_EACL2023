 Prepare the pudding basin by greasing and lining it with baking paper. Grease a sheet of foil and lay a piece of baking paper over the foil. Pleat along the centre; this will go over the top of the pudding once it is made.;
, Sprinkle sugar over the rhubarb and add the water. Place the lid on the saucepan and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, until the rhubarb begins to soften. Pour the cooked rhubarb into a bowl and leave aside to cool. Drain it but keep the syrup.
 Cook over low heat to allow the butter to melt and sugar to dissolve. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for a few minutes. Add the whisked egg and milk.
 Indent the centre of the mixture and fold in the liquid mixture.
 Spread the rhubarb slightly up the edges of the basin. Pour the pudding mixture over the top of the rhubarb into the basin. Place the greased foil and paper arrangement made in step 1 over the top of the pudding basin. Have the foil side face upwards.
 Make a handle - do this by attaching another double length of string on the opposite sides of the rim and tie to the first attached string.
 Pour boiling water into the dish until it comes up halfway around the sides of the pudding basin.
 Bake for two hours. The pudding is ready when a skewer inserted into the pudding comes out clean.
 This goes well with cream or ice cream. If wished, serve with additional cooked rhubarb.
