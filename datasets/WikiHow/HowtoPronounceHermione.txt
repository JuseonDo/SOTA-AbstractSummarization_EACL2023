 The correct pronunciation of “Hermione” has four syllables, so in order to pronounce it correctly, you need to break the whole name down into those syllables.


Write or type the name on a piece of paper; then use your index fingers or additional small pieces of paper to cover up parts of the name.;
, The first syllable is “Her-,” which is at the beginning of the name “Hermione.”


This first syllable is simply pronounced “her,” as in “him or her.”
Cover up the rest of her name (i.e. “-mione”) with your index finger or a small piece of paper so that you focus only on this first syllable.
 After you practice pronouncing “Her-,” cover up that syllable with an index fingers or piece of paper and move onto the next syllable, which is “-mi-.”


Pronounce the second syllable in the same way that you say “my,” as in “my book.” This is one of the two syllables that confuse people the most in pronouncing her name, because some people want to pronounce it as “me.”
The emphasis of the name should fall on this syllable (i.e. “Her-MY-”).



The third syllable is pronounced “uh,” as if you paused in the middle of a sentence.
At this point, you should cover up the first two syllables (i.e. “Her-mi-”) and the last syllable (i.e. “-ne”).
 “Her-mi-o-”) of the name should be covered up at this point.
