Use a hair tie to secure one side of head.



Secure each section with a butterfly clip.



Take out butterfly clip.
Using the wide tooth comb, detangle that section of your hair.
Use the spray bottle when needed. Spraying the hair with water will make detangling hair easier and faster!
Always remember to detangle hair from ends to roots.




Smooth hair lotion along hair shaft starting from the ends and working up towards the root of your hair.
The ends are the weakest part of your hair, applying a little more hair lotion will ensure that they do not get brittle and break off.



Smooth curling pudding along hair shaft starting from the ends and working up towards the root of your hair.



Brush your hair from ends to roots.
Your hair should start to form curls.



Doing this will ensure that every piece of hair is smooth and dries smooth.



Begin by twisting your hair normally (it is best to twist away from the face (twist back) so that when your hair is taken down it does not "fall" in your face).
As you work your way down the section of hair, you will pick up small pieces of hair every time you twist to add to the twist (similar to a french braid).
, Smooth over all of your twists. Doing this will seal the moisture into your twists. Different oils have different benefits:


Coconut Oil: Coconut oil can penetrate the hair shaft leaving your hair moisturized all week.
Olive Oil: Olive oil helps to seal the moisture into your hair.
Castor Oil: Castor oil helps to seal the moisture into your hair while also helping to grow thicker hair.
Argon Oil: Argon oil helps to strengthen the hair shafts.
 To prevent some shrinkage, stretch each twist across your head.

Take the front twist and stretch it to the opposite side of your head.
Secure with a bobby pin.
Complete the above steps until all of your twists are stretched across your head.

Doing this will secure the moisture in your hair.

Be very gentle and make sure your hair is completely dry.
