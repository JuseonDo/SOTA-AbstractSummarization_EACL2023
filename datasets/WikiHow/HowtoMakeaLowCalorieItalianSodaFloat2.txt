 Use a scooper or a tablespoon to scoop two equal portions of sorbet into each glass. You can purchase flavored sorbet at most grocery stores.

Make sure to read the calorie count for the sorbet you are buying.
 Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of club soda into each glass. The sorbet and the soda should mix and give your drink a pink or reddish color., Put one tablespoon (4.9 ml) of almond milk or half-and-half into each glass. You can also use fat-free half-and-half or evaporated skim milk as a healthy replacement for half-and-half., Break off two pieces of fresh mint and place them on the top of each drink. Use a straw to sip the float.
