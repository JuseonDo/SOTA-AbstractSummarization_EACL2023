 Keep doing this until you feel high enough to do a back handspring.;
,, Get a roller that barely touches, or doesn't touch your back at all. Do a back handspring with a higher jump over it. Keep practicing until you an do this with ease.
 Do a high back handspring over it. If you aren't comfortable with this, go to the trampoline and do this before the floor.
 Also get a panel mat. Put the panel mat at the smaller end of the really soft mat. Get a spot, and do a back handspring over it. If you can do this, try it on your own.
 It's best to do this without a spot, because if you can do step 5, you seem ready.
 If she/he says no, and you think your ready, judge honestly, it's better to fail than to fall.
