It is pronounced like 'tea'.



It is pronounced like 'ewe'.
 This is the Welsh translation of 'my'.


It is pronounced roughly like 'vuh'.
 Different to the verb form 'caru', the noun form of 'love' is 'cariad'. But because the word follows 'fy', it mutates into 'nghariad'.


The 'ng' at the beginning of the word is pronounced like the end of 'hang'.
The 'hari' in the middle of the word is pronounced like the name 'Harry'.
'ad' is pronounced like theÂ 'add'.
Together, it should sound like, 'ng-harry-add'.
