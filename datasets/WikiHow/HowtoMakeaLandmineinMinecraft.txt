,, It is a hole that is a block in area and 2 blocks deep.
 Don't put another TNT.


There should be a hole 2 blocks deep with an area of one block with one TNT on the bottom.

If you can, use a pressure plate that matches the block.
 Now make more for a mine field.



Note: The mines could cause a chain reaction if the explosion touches other mines.
Note: Some players won't die unless they are new in Minecraft.
Note: Mines take a few seconds to explode.
