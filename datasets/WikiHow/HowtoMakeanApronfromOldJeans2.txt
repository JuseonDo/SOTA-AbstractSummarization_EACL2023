 The bigger the jean legs are, the bigger the apron can be.
 Cut the back with the pockets apart from the front along the side seams. You can set aside 1 of the legs for another project.
 Cut off the hem at the ankle portion of the leg. This will be the top, or bib, of the apron.
 Cut out a slight inward curve at the top to make a narrower bib. Cut a slight outward curve at the bottom so that the apron is lower in front and tapered at the sides.
 You should choose bias tape in a color or pattern of your liking, so that it makes an attractive apron. Pin the bias tape onto the apron.


You can use ribbon instead of bias tape for the embellishments and ties of your apron. Bias tape allows you to place the denim inside a pre-pressed fold, so it is easy to use in this case.
 Cut approximately 15 inches (38 cm) of bias tape for each tie on the side of your apron. Measure the same point on both sides of the apron and then pin the tape in place.
 Use a complimentary color of thread. Make sure to back stitch where the ties are affixed for extra strength.
 Sew matching bias tape around the perimeter of the pocket. Affix the pocket to the front of the apron with pins, leaving an extra gap in the pocket that will hold ingredients or tools.
