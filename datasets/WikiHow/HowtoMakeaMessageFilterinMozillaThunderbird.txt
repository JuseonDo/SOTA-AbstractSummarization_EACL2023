 You will only ever really need From, Body or Subject. In this, we are going to block all emails from unclelarry@wikihowemailadress.com, so we want to select from.
 This is the best option for From, as then it will only block emails from unclelarry@wikihowemailadress.com, and not thisisunclelarry@mywikihowemailadress.com, or anything containing unclelarry@wikihowemailadress.com

, In this case, it'd be unclelarry@wikihowemailadress.com.
 In our example, we will delete the emails.
, Uncle Larry won't bug you again, of course, this can be used for anyone or anything. If you wanted to delete anything that contains "pass this on" or "buy now" in the body, you could do that!
