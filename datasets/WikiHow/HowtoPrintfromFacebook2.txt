 In order to print a Facebook photo, you'll first need to save the photo in question to your computer--you can't print a photo directly from the site.
, You should see a list of options pop up.
 You may have to choose a save location before the download properly begins.
 If you're using a Mac, you'll need to double-click the photo to open it instead.
 Doing so will bring up the print preferences menu.


Mac users will need to hold down Command and tap P.
If you're using a Mac, you can also click File in the top left corner of the screen and then select Print.
 Depending on what you want your printed product to look like, you may have to alter things like the image size, the color settings, and the style of printing per page.
 As long as your computer is connected to a printer and the printer is set up properly, your photo should begin printing.
