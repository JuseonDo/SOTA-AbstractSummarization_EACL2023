If they seem receptive, suggest different alternatives.



This can cause a negative impact on the client. It can make the client think that perhaps you are an immature developer in the community, or that you have no previous experience of developing a project in real-time. After all, professional and quality work should have some worth. It is a skill within itself to ask for the amount which you deserve.



Be in between the category of those who are asking for more and those who are desperate to work with the clients at any cost.

Make something creative and attractive and sell it in the market.
Take the help of the marketing professionals such as merchandisers willing to work with you .Merchandisers are commonly misunderstood in the information technology domain. These are the people and resources that get to the right audiences and can do all the heavy lifting of marketing for your product.
Use automated installers that are available in the market. These are the newest merchandising software that pay you after every successful installation of your product to the computers of those who download them.
Keep in mind that the targeted audiences may not want to install anything that auto-installs the browser redirectors. Take an opportunity and the responsibility to describe that they are not redirection malware.
