 A glass pie plate or glass casserole dish works well. It will need to have walls, so a dinner plate isn't the best choice.;
, You don't have to measure. Just make a loosely packed layer an inch or so deep, depending on how much sauce you want to make and how large a dish you have.
,,, Cover the dish if you want to save yourself some cleanup., Break up and loosen any clumps of cheese that stick together, or to the bottom.
 Microwave the sauce for about two minutes at a time, stirring in between. It will take about 2-4 two-minute cycles, depending on your microwave and quantities.


If the sauce seems too thick, add more milk and microwave for 20-45 seconds, then stir thoroughly.
If the sauce seems too thin, add more cheese and microwave for about 30 seconds-1 minute or until cheese is melted, then stir thoroughly.
 A little salt will help a lot to bring out the cheese flavor., Pour it over pasta, veggies, or whatever else needs to be a bit cheesier.
