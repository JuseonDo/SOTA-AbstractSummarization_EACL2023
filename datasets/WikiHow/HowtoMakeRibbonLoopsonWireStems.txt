done.

@article
 Cut the wire to the length desired before proceeding.;
, Going from the top of the ribbon (choose an end) make loops by folding loosely backwards and forwards two to three times until you reach the bottom of the ribbon. The amount of loops depend on how large you want the final product to be.
 Use a diagonal cut to prevent further unravelling of the ribbon.
 Twist around tightly to hold the loops firmly in place.
