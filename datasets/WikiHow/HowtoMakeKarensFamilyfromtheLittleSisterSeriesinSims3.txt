, Give him brown hair and a full beard. Make him relatively muscular. Dress him in casual clothing. Use the traits Family-Oriented, Handy, Good, Artistic, and Friendly.
 She, as well as the children, must have blond hair and blue eyes. Dress her, as well, in casual clothing. Give her glasses (not sunglasses!). Her traits should be Family-Oriented, Natural Cook, Good, Friendly, and Bookworm.
 Give him jeans and a T-shirt as his everyday outfit. He must have short hair, with or without a baseball cap (but if a baseball cap is used, make it turned forward). Use the traits Loner, Athletic and Workaholic (for explanation on the last see step 15). Favorite food must be hot dogs or hamburgers.
 Give her a girly everyday outfit. Give her long hair and glasses (extra points for pink or blue rims!). Use the traits Athletic, Artistic and Good. Set her favorite color to pink.
 Create a male cat named Rocky and a female dog named Midgie (who must be small). Give both Rocky and Midgie the Friendly trait, and give Midgie the Playful trait.
 Put a phone in this house. Use the "motherlode" cheat several times to give them more money.
,,,, Set her to studying cooking.
 Choose to stock this terrarium with a rat. Give it the name Emily Junior. Have Karen perform the tasks necessary to care for this rat, for the most part. Seth and Lisa may pitch in, but do not let Andrew have anything to do with the care of Emily Junior.
 Accepting this opportunity would be counter to her personality in the series.


This does not apply to dropping off permission slips or visiting the stadium. Karen would jump at these opportunities (the latter, especially).
 In the series, Andrew is aiming to get on the teacher's good side.
