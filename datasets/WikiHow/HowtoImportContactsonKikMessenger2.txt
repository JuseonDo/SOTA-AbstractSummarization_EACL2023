 If you’re new to Kik, you can import your contacts during setup. Kik will use the email addresses and phone numbers in your contacts to find your friends who use the app. Start by installing Kik if you haven’t yet done so.
 You’ll be prompted to enter your contact information, and also to choose a unique username for your Kik account. Tap “Register” when you’re done.
 You’ll have to complete a short activity to verify that you’re a human before arriving at this screen.
 Kik will now sync your phone contacts with your Kik account. If any of your phone contacts use Kik (and have not opted out of the Find Friends feature), their accounts will now display in Kik.To send a contact a message, tap their profile photo and select “Chat.”
