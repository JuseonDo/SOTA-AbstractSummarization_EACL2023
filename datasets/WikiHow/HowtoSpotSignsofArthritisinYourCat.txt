 Does she jump as usual or do you notice her using props such as a chair, stool, pile of papers or such to help her get to the higher level, something which she hasn't used in the past? Cats with arthritis will try to alleviate the limitations caused by arthritis by finding props to help them still get up high.;
, Does she look hesitant, act stuck or try to use a staircase approach to get down from the height by jumping onto objects in descending order.
 Arthritic cats often try to avoid climbing stairs.
 A cat in good health will still be a little playful even into older age. An arthritic cat will play less often or perhaps not at all.
 Although this can be a sign of just getting older or even of a different illness, if coupled with the other signs, it might indicate arthritis.
 Sometimes there is muscle wastage which can show up as thinner, weaker legs.
 Explain your concerns and offer your observations of the cat's behavior.
