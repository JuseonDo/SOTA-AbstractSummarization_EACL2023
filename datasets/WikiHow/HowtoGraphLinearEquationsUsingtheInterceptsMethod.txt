 Identify both. For the sake of clarity, let the independent be x and the dependent be y.;
,, This will generate a coordinate for your y-intercept. First, substitute x to zero. Then, subtract the product from both sides of the equation. Note that the operation you will perform with both sides depends on the sign of your number. In this case the number is zero so we will use its opposite, subtraction. After that, divide three from both sides. And, VOILA! You have the answer.
 (x,y) Since x=0, your coordinate pair will be similar to: (0,y).
, Again, since you set y=0, your coordinate pair will look something like: (x,0).
