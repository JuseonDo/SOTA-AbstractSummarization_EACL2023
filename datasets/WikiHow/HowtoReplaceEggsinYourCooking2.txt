 Banana is one of the most popular choices for egg replacements in sweet recipes like muffins, breads, and cake. Use 1/2 banana to yield 1/4 cup puree.The banana will alter the taste of your baked goods, so make sure you like banana-flavored muffins, breads, etc. before you add it to your recipe. Otherwise, look for something with a milder taste.
 Applesauce or other fruit purees will make whatever you were cooking or baking heavy and dense, so if you want something lighter, you will have to add baking powder as well.Applesauce works great with recipes like brownies are chocolate cake, because the chocolate hides the flavor of the applesauce. It won't alter the taste of your brownies like banana or another fruit might.Use 1/3 cup puree to replace one egg or 1/4 cup puree with 1 Tsp baking powder for a lighter, fluffier product., Pumpkin can also leave a distinct flavor in baked goods, so it's best to incorporate it in a recipe that works well with pumpkin. Bread, muffins, and spice cakes will all benefit from the moisture, binding properties, and taste of pumpkin.Make sure the pumpkin is pureed so that it is smooth and won't make lumps in your baked goods.
 Sour cream also makes an excellent binding agent.
