 Grab a handful of it from the bag and close it with your hand.;
,, Apply the milky substance you get to your face.
 Massage onto skin for one minute, then rinse off. It should feel soft and be gentle and hydrating and will help to firm the skin.
 Get a small jar (such as a baby food one) and fill it a fourth full with the apple cider vinegar. Take fresh brewed green tea and fill the jar the rest of the way.
 This toner is anti-aging, packed with anti-oxidants, and dissolves away fatty deposits on skin's surface., Pour about five tablespoons sugar into a bowl, and add three tablespoons cooled green tea. Then add in two tablespoons pure honey, and you have your scrub.
 Let sit for another ten, and then rinse off.
 Your skin should feel softer and be moisturized, as well as firmer and brighter.
 Simply add a half a cup of plain yogurt into a bowl and add in two tablespoons of honey. Mix well.
 Leave on for fifteen minutes, then rinse off.
 This is great for all skin types, since it controls oil and moisturizes the skin at the same time.
 After cleansing with the oatmeal, apply either a mask or a scrub. Or, if you're on that odd day of the week, skip straight to the toner.
