Wait till the last moment to jerk out of the way and move past the other car. “Avoided Accident 100+” will flash on your HUD (heads-up display), meaning you have avoided an accident (Crash Escape) and earned 100 points.
 For your next Crash Escape, you will be awarded 100x2 points (200), 100x3 points for your third Crash Escape, and so on.
