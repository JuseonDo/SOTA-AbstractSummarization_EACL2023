 Many side quests can start from just talking to people in towns.;
, After walking through the main quest, chances are that you'll have picked up quite a few more quests. Start doing them, they can be a lot of fun!

, The Dark Brotherhood or The Companions are good ones to try.
 Both give you special skills and abilities.
 If you haven't joined either the Stormcloaks or the Imperials, look back in your quest log, and there should be a quest that will start your journey.
 Choose a different race, and try a different playstyle. Start a mage or assassin character, if you played as a warrior the first time. Playing as a different class can really enhance your experience.
