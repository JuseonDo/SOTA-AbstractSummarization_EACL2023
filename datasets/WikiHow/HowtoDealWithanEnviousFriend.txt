 They will not admit they are envious typically. Steer away from this person. Keep away until they confess and say sorry. If not keep away, you can not afford to keep envious people in your private world. People that envy you are not your friends.;
, See his actions, words, etc. Sometimes they may make a facial response, so be alert.
 For example: You would like to sing, and he says you shouldn't because you are a bad singer but others say you have a great voice, something's wrong.
 If you don't succeed try to Break Up with that friend.
 You might not see he's envious, but if you tell others the situation they may identify it.
, You might be mistaken for something you did that he hated and he's trying to take revenge. Or maybe he's in a bad mood; and people who are always in a bad mood often try to make others feel like dirt.
