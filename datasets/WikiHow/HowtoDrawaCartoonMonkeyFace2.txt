 If you cannot imagine this arrangement, lightly sketch these shapes with a pencil and erase them after the next step., You should have an oval with two lumps on top. Notice that there are three inward points, one at the top, one at the left and one at the right. If you chose to sketch the two circles and oval, erase any unnecessary lines now. Be sure to erase accordingly., This is the monkey's face., These are the monkey's ears., This is the monkey's nose., Notice that they look like the number "11". These are the monkey's eyes., Experiment with different types of mouths. A short upward curve makes a good smile. Alternatively, try a small circle or broad line with creases on each end. Place the mouth higher or lower for different effects., Add other interesting details to personalize your monkey.
