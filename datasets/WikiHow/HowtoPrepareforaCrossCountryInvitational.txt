 Carbohydrates are the primary energy source that your body uses when running, so you need to have plenty on hand. Don't gorge yourself, but a spaghetti dinner is the classic meal to prepare for long runs.;
, This includes bottled water, snacks like crackers or fruit bars, money, cell phone, warm-ups, and don't forget your racing shoes.
 There's no need to be rushing around in the morning trying to find it.
 Eight hours at the minimum! You may have a hard time getting to sleep because of your nerves, so try to get to sleep early.
 An apple should be good if you run in less than two hours. Oatmeal is a great breakfast if you run later in the day.
 Good energy will help you when you're racing.
, A good spot is key to a good race.
