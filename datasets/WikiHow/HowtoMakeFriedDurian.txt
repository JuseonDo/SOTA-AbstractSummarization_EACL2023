 Take the seeds out. Slice the durian into pieces, thinly cutting with a knife or using a grater. Try to slice the pieces with same thickness.
 Wait for the palm oil to heat up.,, Then remove from the oil and put the durian on paper towels to dry. The paper towel will absorb any excess oil., Sprinkle them with some sea salt for taste., The durian can also be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 months. Enjoy!
