@summary
start by drawing a rectangular shape with a narrow bottom.

@summary
draw another rectangle on the right side of the first rectangle.

@summary
on top of both rectangles, sketch a curving, bumpy line.

@summary
outline the shape of the box and popcorn over the sketch.

@summary
add in color!
@article
 It should look sort of like a doorway or a long, prismatic piece of paper.;
, It should be the mirror image of the first rectangle, and look sort of like a pamphlet.
 This should depict the shape of the popcorn coming out of the box. Refer to the image here to help you.
 Also add details to the box, like a simple logo or picture to represent its contents. Use a dark color for this step, and afterwards erase all unnecessary pencil lines underneath.
 Use bright yellow for the popcorn and add colored stripes on the side of the box to give it an old-fashioned look; the specific details are up to you.
