 Plain is best but if not, have it with an intimidating red design. No logos though that just makes you look like a tool. However subtle, grey logos are fine. It only depends on what you think would fit.;
, You can wear any type of dark colored pants you would like, even leggings, preferably dark ones.
 At the very least, wear black shoes that cover your whole foot. No Sith was ever feared or respected in sandals.
 This isn't completely required but, as part of a whole outfit, it will enhance the image. This also applies to black gloves. (If you decide to wear dark grey jeans, a black belt will add a splash of darkness to your look!) Even experiment with various accessories such as goggles or black socks. Try to be subtle about your appearance, no Sith would ever care about looks.
 Maybe you can have a lightsaber battle with other friends.
 It's free to do and has a plethora of benefits. Some of the benefits include patience and concentration which are Sith-like qualities!

, Sith view conflict as an opportunity for growth in which weakness is weeded out. Try to persuade your friends to join in lightsaber battles with you, and they might thank you.
