 Even though you will be cooking the peppers, it's always a good idea to thoroughly wash all vegetables before eating.;
, Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts (to better hold the egg in place). Cut away the white inner flesh and seeds.
 By cracking the egg into the bowl first, you can remove any shells or avoid having a bad egg drop into the pepper rings.
 Give the pan a few minutes to heat up before adding food.
 Allow the rings to cook and brown lightly before adding the egg. If possible, you may want to turn the rings over a few times so both sides cook evenly.
 Gently allow the egg to slide from the bowl into the ring middle.
, Slide it underneath one egg and pepper ring.


Lift carefully from the skillet and onto your plate.
