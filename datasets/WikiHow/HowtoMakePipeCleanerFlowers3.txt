 This will make your petals. You can any color you want to make your rose, but make sure that all 4 pipe cleaners are the same color. The most popular rose colors are red, pink, and white.


After you cut them, make sure that the mini pipe cleaners are all the same height.
 Save the last mini pipe cleaner for later. You will need it to hold your rose together.
 The top of mini bundle should be level with the top of the green pipe cleaner. The bottom of the mini bundle should be facing towards the bottom of the green pipe cleaner. Make sure that the mini pipe cleaners are gathered all around the green pipe cleaner.


The green pipe cleaner will be your stem. To make it stronger, fold a whole green pipe cleaner in half, and twist it to make a thick, half-sized pipe cleaner.
 Start wrapping the mini pipe cleaner around the bundle, moving upwards towards the top. This will hold your rose together.


Wrap the mini pipe cleaner as tightly as you can, or your rose won't hold together very well.
 You will end up with something that looks like a spider or sea anemone.Don't worry, you will end up with a pretty rose when you are done, and not a spider.


Be gentle when spreading the mini pipe cleaners, or you will pull them apart.
 Start by folding the tip of each mini pipe cleaner over. Then, roll each mini pipe cleaner towards the green pipe cleaner at the center. Keep the roll as flat as you can, like a disk. These will become your petals.Roll all of the mini pipe cleaners in the same direction.
 When you are done rolling the petals, many of them will probably be vertical; they should be horizontal. To make them look more rose-like, turn each disk/petal so that it is horizontal. Some disks/petals will need to be on top of each other.


There should be fewer petals towards the center, and more towards the outside.
The petals will also be closer together towards the center than the outside.
 You can give it to someone you care about, or stick it into a pretty vase.
