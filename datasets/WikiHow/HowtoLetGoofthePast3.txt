 However, there are enormous psychological benefits to forgiving others.Specifically telling people that you forgive them can help. If someone has said something cruel to you, try telling that person “I was hurt when you said X, but I want you to know that I’m letting it go because I want to move on. I forgive you.”

, When you place blame on others, you may have a subconscious expectation for them to correct things. It is more effective, however, to acknowledge an issue and focus on moving on.


For instance, if a partner’s spending habits have created financial troubles, don’t just say “You’ve ruined things!” Instead, try to be more constructive: “We are having financial problems and need to make some changes in our spending habits.”

, If someone has hurt you or done you wrong in the past, don’t focus on retaliating. While you may think it would be very satisfying to see the person get hurt, you will feel better if you move on.


For instance, if you are angry because you think that a someone took an ex away from you, approach that person and say something like: "I was upset at first, but I want everyone to be happy and move on. I want you to know that I accept your relationship."

, It is hard enough to change yourself, let alone someone else. If you let others worry about taking care of their own problems, you will have more energy and attention to devote to correcting yours.
 Time to reflect can work wonders.


You might make an agreement with someone to come back to a problem at a later date. For instance, if you are having relationship troubles, you might consider taking a break from one another.
