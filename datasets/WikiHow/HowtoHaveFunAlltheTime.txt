 Joining clubs is an amazing way to have fun, and meet your new best friend. They don't have to be boring. If you like math, go for it! Acting? Go for it! Cooking food? Go for it!;
, Even better, host parties to your liking.
 You don't want to realise your schedule has two things at once.
 Some ideas are dance classes, volunteer work, exercise/fitness programs, art lessons, music lessons, sports teams, clubs. Maybe even babysitting little, cute kids can do the trick.
 do something wacky, like jumping in the lake/pool or going for a 5 hour bike ride.
 Take water guns and fill them with paint to make a masterpiece. Awesome things are to host a hula hoop competition, go through old music, bake cookies etc. . Do random things a kid would do.
 Cooking supper? Dance to music. Raking leaves? Jump in them. Doing laundry? lay in the warm clothes. Fun? You bet.
 Invite people along even if you don't know them well.
 If you go to a Mexican restaurant order the spiciest thing on the menu like a "Blazing inferno" (guaranteed to get your friends to have a laugh and an opportunity to try out their new camera phones!). You will laugh your head off.
