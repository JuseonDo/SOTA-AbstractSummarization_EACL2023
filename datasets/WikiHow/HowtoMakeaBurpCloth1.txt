 Pick some absorbent fabric for the body of the burp cloth, such as terry, minky, or flannel. Next, pick some patterned cotton fabric for the center strip. It can be baby or nursery-themed, or just something you find pretty.;
, Avoid using dryer sheets when drying your fabric, as they may make your fabric less-absorbent.


Don't cut your fabric first; it may end up shrinking by quite a bit!

, Cut the absorbent fabric into a 12 by 16-inch (30.48 by 40.64-centimeter) rectangle. Cut the patterned fabric into a 5 by 16-inch (12.7 by 40.64-centimeter) strip. Set the absorbent fabric aside for now.
 Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the long edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters), and secure them with sewing pins. Press the edges flat with an iron, then remove the sewing pins.
 Make sure that the patterned fabric is centered, and that the narrow edges are aligned with the narrow edges of the absorbent fabric. Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric in place.
 Pull the pins put as you go.
 This will longer than you actually need to wrap around the edges of your burp cloth, but it's better to have something be too long than too short. Remember, it is always easier to cut down something that is too long than to add length to something that is too short!


You can also use ½-inch (0.27-centimeter) double-fold bias tape instead.
 Wrap the sides of the ribbon tape over the edges of the burp cloth, so that it looks the same on both sides. Pin the ribbon in place as you go.If you are using bias tape: Open up the bias tape first, then fold the end under by ½ inch (0.27 centimeters). After that, wrap it around the burp cloth, tucking the edges of the cloth into the fold of the bias tape.
 Try to get as close to the inner edge as you can, and remove the pins as you go. To prevent the thread from unraveling, backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing.
