@summary
a solid colored background is the most basic type of background that you can put on a website.

@summary
open your web code (source).

@summary
,

@summary
in the body tag, add an attribute called bgcolor.

@summary
experimenting with rgb and # can lead to many shades, but you can take the easy first way.

@summary
add the background property to the body tag, so it looks like this-<body background="src">

@summary
where src is the source of the image src can be in the same folder,or another folder/webpage.

@summary
remember to type the .gif/ .jpeg /.bmp extension.

@summary
,

@summary
to add a solid colored background in css, add a style attribute.

@summary
your body tag should look like this-

@summary
<body style="background-color: colorname;">

@summary
where the colorname is the name of the color, hex value or rgb(also remember the last steps of the solid colored background in html, the are applicable here too) .

@summary

@summary
to add an image, add the style attribute to the body tag.

@summary
your body tag should now look like this-

@summary
<body style="background-image:url('src'); ">

@summary
,

@summary
remember that src is the source.

@summary
remember to add the .extensions too.

@summary
,

@summary
to make a repeated pattern background, add a background as said in the steps above.

@summary
fixed image backgrounds look cool and do not change as you scroll down.

 In fact, every website begins with a default white background. However, while a white background can be very sleek and clean looking when used with a harmonious color scheme, a different colored background may be favored with different themes.;
,, Now, you body tag should look like this-<body bgcolor="COLORNAME">
where COLORNAME is the name of the color. COLORNAME can be filled with many types of color representatives-



<body bgcolor="red">(color name)

<body bgcolor="#FF0000">(hex value)

<body bgcolor="rgb(255, 8, 9)">(RGB value)

, But remember that typing an uncommon color as "Ultramarine Bluish Green" will result in white.




<body background="red.gif">(in same folder)

<body background="\Folder1\red.gif">(inside a different folder)

<body background="imagepage1/red.gif">(in a different webpage)

,, You can also give IDs and Classes and use both External and internal stylesheets.
, You can also give IDs and Classes and use both External and internal stylesheets.
, It can be from the same folder, different folder or a different web page.



<body style="background-image:red.gif;">(in same folder)

<body style="background-image:\Folder1\red.gif">(inside a different folder)

<body style="background-image:imagepage1/red.gif">(in a different web page).
, Your body tag must be now changed to-<body style="background-image: url('SRC'); background-repeat:REPEAT-SETTINGS; "> Where REPEAT-SETTINGS are the settings. There can be many repeat settings, like-



<body style="background-image: red.gif; background-repeat: repeat;">(The background will repeat both vertically and horizontally.)

<body style="background-image: red.gif; background-repeat: repeat-x;">(The background will repeat horizontally.)

<body style="background-image: red.gif; background-repeat: repeat-y;">(The background will repeat vertically.)

, To do them you just need to do some simple tweaks to the code in the above section. Do the tweaks to make the body tag look like this-



<body style="background-image:url('SRC'); background-attachment:fixed; background-position:POSITION; background-repeat:REPEAT SETTINGS;">
where SRC is the source of the background image, POSITION is the position of the image(it can range from center to top-right); background-attachment is the main "catalyst" of this background type. It is used to tell the position of the background and it is recommended that it should not be changed.
