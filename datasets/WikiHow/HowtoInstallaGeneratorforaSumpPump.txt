 Most generators run on fuel such as gasoline or diesel, so it is very important that the machine be in a location that will allow the exhaust to dissipate. If you store a generator in an unprotected area, the generator may sustain damage from rain, ice, lightning strikes or falling objects.
 Use this measurement to determine how long of an extension cord you will need when you install the generator to the sump pump. You may require multiple extension cords.,, You will know the pump is working because you will hear the water being pumped away from the building and you will see the water begin to drain in the sump pump hole. Once you know the pump is working, make sure water continues to drain and is sent away from the building until the water is at a low level in the pump hole.
