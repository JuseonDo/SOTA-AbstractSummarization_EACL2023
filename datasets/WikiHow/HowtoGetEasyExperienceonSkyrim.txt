 As soon as you get the armor and sword from the chest where the arrow is pointing at, he'll start to move on.
 To do this, press the red B button. Choices will come up; move your Right Stick to the right, and your inventory will come up. Go down to 'weapons' and select the 'iron sword' to equip it.
 Press down the Left Stick to sneak. Now walk towards him.
 Now attack by clicking the Left Trigger. Your sneak skill and one-handed skill should go up.


You can raise your destruction stat here, too. To do this, attack with your destruction magic to attack.

 Get into the cavern with the bear. When Hadvar gives you the bow and arrows, hit him with your two-handed sword.


You can also level up your archery skill here with the bow her gives you, or you can use one you picked up from earlier in the game.
 You shouldn't hit him while he's down.
