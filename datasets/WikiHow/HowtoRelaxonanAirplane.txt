 Make sure that the airline's seats have a seat pitch just right for you and that there is some forms of entertainment provided for you ( especially for long flights). If there is no entertainment for you, bring your own forms of entertainment such as books or a tablet to keep you awake.;
, Also ensure that the duration of the stopover is no longer than 5 hours. Some long waits at certain airports may be very boring and you may doze off.
 Sometimes you might really be up and awake if you sleep very early on the night before.
 If you come at about 2 1/2 hours before your flight, not many people will be queuing at the check-in area, allowing a smoother process.
 Looking at the lush greenery may make you daydream and fall to sleep, if not, it will at least make you a little bit more relaxed than you were previously.
 Walking around, especially on long journeys, will allow blood to circulate more and thus you are more relaxed.
 You will get easily dehydrated when in the air, so, to make sure that you drink a lot of fluid in sips, not gulps.
 Chat with the person sitting next to you or even the flight attendants! Just make sure that the flight attendants are not busy doing their duties when you're trying to chat with them.
 You can see what country your plane is hovering above, and it is really quite interesting.
 Is it the white sandy beaches that you're visiting, or is it the gastronomic delights and the shopping centers that you will visit and buy stuff there? If you think about them while closing your eyes, you might just doze off and whoosh, you're at your destination!
