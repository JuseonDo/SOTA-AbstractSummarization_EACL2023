be a good role model.

 If your child is below 2 years of age, consider using non-fluoride toothpaste, as fluoride can be upsetting to little tummies. However, children above 2 years can use fluoride toothpaste, but only a pea-sized amount.;
, Show him/her a few times, and then let him/her try it himself/herself. If your child is an infant, then do his/her brushing for him/her. However, toddlers and older children should start learning how to brush their own teeth.
 Kids learn from their parents. Brush your teeth correctly three times a day, and this will teach your child to do the same.
