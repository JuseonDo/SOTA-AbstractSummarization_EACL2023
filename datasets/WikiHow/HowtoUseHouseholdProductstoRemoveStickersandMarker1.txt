 Before you smear the sticker area with mayo, try to peel/remove the sticker without damaging the box or surface. Remove the sticker as slowly as possible in order to keep the sticker in tact as you remove it (keeping it in tact will open the possibility of getting more sticker off the item rather than trying to rip pieces).;
, Try to remove as much leftover residue that may be easy to lift off the item.
 Depending upon the sticker size, approximately 1 tsp. could do the job.
 You want the compound to permeate the sticker and any remaining residue so give the mayo some time to start working.
 You may need to also use your index finger to rub the area in the even the sticker does not peel easily.
 If the sticker still does not budge or you only remove a portion, repeat the process. Consider adding more mayo if you feel as though the mayonnaise didnâ€™t do the job during the first pass.
