@summary
find and purchase a sturdy, thick notebook with more than one hundred pages.

@summary
start by writing a few sentence starters like "my name is...", "i am...years...months old", "my birthday is on..." etc.

@summary
on the next blank page write in big, bold bubble letters "my own story".

@summary
do not necessarily start by talking about your birth - it is not supposed to be in a chronological order!,

@summary
when you finish your first writing session hide the journal so that you can return to it later.

@summary
before starting your new writing session leave a 3–10 centimeter (1.2–3.9 in) gap in between the previous writing session.

@summary
when your life book is finished, consider let people read certain parts.
@article
 It should be inspiring. A cover with only one colour and no patterns would be perfect as you can decorate it with photographs and drawings of yourself or your favourite things.;
, You can also include starters about your un/favourite things to do such as "I like eating...", "My favourite film is..." and so on. Write at least 12 sentence starters. After you've finished add your personal information and pictures. Add descriptions if you like, so that it will be more interesting.
 You can embellish it with doodles, zig-zags and colours.
 Write about what seems more relevant such as if you're feeling particularly hungry that day you may write "I feel like eating a candy bar right this instant. Think about a chocolate twice my size. I can see myself licking it, gnawing it carefully...". Once you start your imagination will flow.
 If you want it to be completely private, considering keeping your Life Book in a computer and password protecting it until it's finished. DO NOT purchase one of those diaries with locks as they break fairly easily.
 If you are feeling uninspired follow the same procedures as you did when you started.
 If you typed it, it is time to print and bind it. If you are writing in the computer than consider having it one hundred pages as that is a reasonable amount to tell the story of your life. If your story is typed you can change fonts and add images more easily. However, a notebook never looses it's beauty and charm.
