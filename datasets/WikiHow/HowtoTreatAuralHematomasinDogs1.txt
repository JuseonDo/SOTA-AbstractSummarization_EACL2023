 Medical correction involves removing the blood from the hematoma pocket by sucking it out using a needle and syringe. The syringe is disconnected from the needle which is left in place in the ear. A small volume of injectable steroid (5 ml of dexamethasone) is then instilled into the dead space via the needle.The needle is then removed from the ear and gentle pressure is applied with a finger and thumb over the pinprick, for 30 seconds or so, to encourage the hole to seal over.;
, Your dog will not have to wear a buster collar (the large cones that look keep your dog from pulling out stitches). This is because there are no stitches to pull out.


When you bring your dog back in, the vet will check to see if the ear has refilled with blood. If it has, the procedure will need to be repeated. Approximately 50% of cases need a repeat procedure., If the ear has refilled again, the procedure will need to be repeated again.


If it continues on like this for many weeks, surgery may be considered as an alternative, and more permanent, treatment.
