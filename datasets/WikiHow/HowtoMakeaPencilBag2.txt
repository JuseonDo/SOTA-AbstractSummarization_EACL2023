 Allow for a half-inch/1 centimeter (0.4 in) seam allowance on all sides.


Another alternative is to fold one large piece of fabric in half and use the fold as the base of the pencil bag. You'll need to press the fold line before stitching the bag together if you do this instead of using two pieces of fabric.
, Fold over a half-inch/1 centimeter (0.4 in) of fabric on one side of the square or rectangle and iron it flat. Place the edge of the zipper beneath the fold. Stitch the zipper in place with a tight, sturdy stitch.
 Double stitch the seams to ensure strength.
 Turn the case right side out and make sure you can not see the part that you sewed .
 Fill with pencils and related items and you're all set.
