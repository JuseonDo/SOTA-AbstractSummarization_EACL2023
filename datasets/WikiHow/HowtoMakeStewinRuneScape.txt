 You can either craft this if you have level 8 crafting or buy one at any General Store for a few GP.
 You can use any sink or a water fountain to get the water by using the bowl on the water source,or use water staff., Cook the meat, on a range or over a fire, to receive a "cooked meat" in your inventory., If you're a member, you can also farm your own potatoes with a level 1 farming., Then, click on the bowl (now "incomplete stew") then click on the potato to "use" it. This will give you an "uncooked" stew.,
