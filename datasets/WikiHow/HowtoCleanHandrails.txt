 Combine an equal amount of mineral or coconut oil with baking soda. Mix thoroughly with a spoon.

Continue until it has picked up all the moisture., If you have any serious rough spots or blemishes in the wood, consider using a sanding sponge. Start at the top of the rail and sand your way down, always rubbing parallel to the gain of the wood.A sanding sponge is flexible so it will conform to the shape of your rail. One side will be rough, allowing you to rub the surface and scrub out imperfections.

Be extra careful to get to the hard to reach underside of the rail., For hard to pick up spots, use a plastic scouring pad that is non-abrasive.
