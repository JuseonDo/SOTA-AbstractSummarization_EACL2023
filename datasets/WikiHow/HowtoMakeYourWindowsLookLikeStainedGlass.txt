* Keep your designs simple to start out with. Small intricate patterns are difficult to do so that they can be seen once the design  is finished. If you want to simulate cut glass designs, draw your base design first, then draw in random connecting lines throughout your base design.
*Make sure your design will touch all four sides, or separate any large amount of clear space with a leaded line.;
, This can be a purchased sheet or you can use any flat, clear, smooth plastic cover such as those from a disposable container if it is large enough to fit your design.
 You should practice just making straight lines and circles first to get used to how the liquid flows. You need to be able to control the flow so your lines are even and not blotchy or wiggly.
 Applying color while leading still wet can result in blurred outlines.
 If you don't there will be holes in the design and it will be more difficult to peel off. For large areas, you may use a palette  knife or a small spatula to smooth the color.
 The thicker the application, the longer the drying time. Test several areas before trying to peel off design.
, It will stick on the window and  it can be peeled off and repositioned.


If the design doesn't stick, make sure the window is clean and dampen the back of the design slightly with a moist (not wet!)paper towel.
If portions of the design fails to stick, press your hand against the area and leave for 5 minutes to warm the area and make it more pliable.
