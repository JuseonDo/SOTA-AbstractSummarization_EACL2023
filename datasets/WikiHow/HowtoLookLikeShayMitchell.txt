 You can regularly spot her rocking black outfits. You can buy black stuff everywhere and you probably have a little black dress in your closet, which would be great to wear.;
, Be elegant yet girly. Cute yet super hot, I am sure you can pull off anything!

,, She wears a lot of designer brands, but you can find some really inexpensive alternatives. If you want to see Shay Mitchell inspired outfits, see the link below.
 She recently did a collaboration with quay (QuayxShay), so you'll probably see her rock some of the sunglasses she created with quay. Any sunglasses will do though, since the collaboration is full of many styles, you probably already have some appropriate shades.
 Shay's hair is pretty long and it is dark brown with light brown/blonde highlights. If you don't have long or even dark hair, don't worry, it is just as an inspiration!

, Shay usually just has her hair curled away from her face. Sometimes she rocks some braids or wet/slicked back straight hair.
 You can get her exact look with the following steps, but if you don't want to exactly copy her make up or you don't wear so much make up, just some mascara and a nude lipstick will do.


For her look you will need black eyeshadow, an angled brush, a blending brush, mascara, false eyelashes (if desired), nude lipstick, bronzer (preferably matte), blush, highlighter, foundation, and concealer.
 Put on your usual base (foundation, concealer or bb cream) and if you want to, apply some lip balm before you put on the lipstick.
 Put the bronzer on your cheekbones, forehead and down your neck.
 Shay usually wears rosy and bronze blushes. If you want, you can use a shimmery gold color as a highlighter.
 Put it as close to your lashline as possible and then blend.


Always look into the mirror because you don't want to look like panda, do you? Repeat this step until you're done.
 Boom, you're done!
