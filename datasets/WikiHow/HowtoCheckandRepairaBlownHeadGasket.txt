 High temperatures can cause your gasket to blow, and once this has occurred, your engine temperature will only continue to rise. If your car is constantly overheating, this could be a sign that your head gasket has blown.;
, If your head gasket is blown, coolant may be leaking from the cooling system.
 Check the colour of your oil. If it’s white and milky looking, or if your oil dipstick reveals a frothy substance, chances are your oil has mixed with the coolant and your head gasket has blown.
 If you spot white smoke emerging from your exhaust pipe, this could mean that the coolant has leaked into the combustion chamber.
,, Once the compressor is free, lay the device on its side in order to access the cylinder head.
, You won’t need to take off the entire alternator harness; simply remove the bolts.
 Disconnect all the lines running to the air conditioner.
 Refer to your service manual and pay close attention to the tightening sequence for the head bolts that hold the head gasket in place, as these must be loosened in the correct reverse order.
 Be sure to thoroughly clean the cylinder head, so that the new head gasket sits correctly.
  You’ll need a torque wrench to do so, as the bolts must be torqued to a specific tightness, relevant to your particular vehicle. It’s crucial that these bolts are torqued correctly, as otherwise you may cause damage to your new head gasket.
 Reconnect the hoses in the order in which you disconnected them, replace the alternator, and ensure that all necessary parts are once again in place.
 Allow the engine to run for several minutes before switching it off and checking your new head gasket for any leaks.
