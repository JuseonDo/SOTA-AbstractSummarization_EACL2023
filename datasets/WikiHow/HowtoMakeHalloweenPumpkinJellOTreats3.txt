 If they are whole, slice them into neat halves.
 For example, use small triangles for eyes and a nose, and a semi-circle for the smile. Keep it simple and be careful when cutting with the knife.

 Follow the time suggested by the manufacturer.
 The peach pumpkin faces in Jell-O are now ready for serving. When serving, be sure to serve intact peaches so that each child gets a proper "pumpkin" for dessert, plus a good share of surrounding Jell-O.
