 To install a new icon, you’ll first have to download an icon file (.ico) from the internet.
 This will bring up a list of sites with alternative Chrome icons. Design Shack and Icon Archive are both excellent options for free, easily-downloadable icons.You shouldn’t have to pay or give out any personal information for these icons.
 Keep in mind that you can do this as many times as you like, so feel free to experiment with multiple different icons.
 This will take you to the icon’s download preferences.
 Some sites allow you to pick the size of the icon or implement different color schemes.
 Most sites have the option to download as a PNG file or a JPEG file as well, but the ICO file is the only file your computer will recognize as an icon.
, For example, you might store it in your “Pictures” folder or the same folder where Google Chrome is installed.


If you place your icon somewhere obtrusive and accidentally delete it later, your Chrome icon will change back to the original icon.
 You can do this by selecting the icon image, holding down ⌘ Command, and tapping C.



For a Mac, open the Finder.
 Chrome should come up in the search window. On PC, it will be listed as a “Desktop App”.
 This will take you to Google Chrome’s directory—for example, your “Documents” folder.


On Mac, click “Get Info”.
 This will open the Properties menu.


On a Mac, click the picture at the top of “Get Info”, then paste the icon with ⌘ Command + V. Your icon should now be changed!

, This will allow you to choose from a couple of the default icons included in Chrome’s installation.
 This will allow you to select an icon file from your computer.
 This should be wherever you saved it.
 This will save your changes. You now have a new icon!


If your Chrome icon was pinned to your taskbar or Start menu beforehand, you’ll need to unpin it, and then repin using the original file found in Chrome’s directory before the icon swap will show.
