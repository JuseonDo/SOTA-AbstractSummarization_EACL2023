The Uldaman dungeon and Angor Fortress are in the northern part of the zone.
The main Horde city of New Korgath is at the western edge of the zone. You can find a flight path there.
The only other Horde flight path in the Badlands is at Bloodwatcher Point, although you can find a neutral flight master at Fuselight, in the eastern area south of Camp Kosh.
The Alliance maintains a presence in two areas of Badlands: Dustwind Dig and the Dragon's Mouth.;
, You want to circle to the rear of the city by moving counter-clockwise from east to west.
 The path is marked by flaming torches.


After the path peaks, continue following it downhill and into the Searing Gorge zone.

Be sure to pick up the neutral flight path at the foot of the mountain.



Inside the mountain, you will find yourself on a tilted ring of stone. There will be a floating chunk of rock chained to the sides of the ring.
