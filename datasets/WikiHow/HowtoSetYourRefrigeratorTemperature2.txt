 A dial usually comes preset with the arrow pointed toward the center. To the right side, you may see a word that says "cooler" while to the left you may see a word that says "warmer."

, Next to "cooler" or "warmer" you may see a series of numbers. Dialing 1 number in the "cooler" direction will drop your refrigerator temp slightly lower, while dialing 1 number in the "warmer" direction will dial your refrigerator temp slightly higher.
 Check your temperature again after 5 to 8 hours to see if the reset had any effect. If you don't see enough of a change, turn the dial to the next number.
, If the dial is bumped out of position, then you will know exactly where to reposition it.
