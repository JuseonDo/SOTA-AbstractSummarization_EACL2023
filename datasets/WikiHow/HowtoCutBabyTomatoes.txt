 You want an even layer of tomatoes, no tomatoes should be on top of each other.;
, You should have a perfect fit so make sure the edges line up but you also have a small gap between the two plates.


Don’t press downward or you may smash the tomatoes. A gentle fit will work well.
 Your top hand should hold the plate in place so the tomatoes (and plate) don’t roll around.
