, Don't spend hours doing this, just grab yourself 2 bin bags, a cardboard box and a tray. Put all the dirty clothes in one bin bag, and clean clothes back into your wardrobe/closet/drawers. Then put all rubbish in the other bin bag and anything that shouldn't be in your room (like cups and stuff you borrowed from your mum)on the tray. Put the tray in the hall to be sorted later. Put anything else lying around the room in the box and tuck the box out of sight.
 Look bigger, doesn't it? Even just tidying your room can make it a nicer place to be.
 Perhaps that table is in an inconvenient place? Or maybe your desk is looking a bit cluttered? Have a nice long think about it.
 Start with what you want to achieve the most.
 BE sure to get somebody to help you and move the furniture SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY.
 Too much stuff on your desk? Put some of the stuff on the top of your chest of drawers. This looks cool and helps even out the amount of clutter.
, Decide where you want the posters to go, or if you want to put them back up at all.
