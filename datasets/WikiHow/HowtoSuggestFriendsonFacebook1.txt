 You’ll need to use a web browser to suggest a friend on Facebook, as this feature isn’t supported by the app.;
,,


If you’re already signed in, you can skip this step.
 Suggesting a friend sends the same message to both friends, so you can visit either friends’ profile.


To search for a friend: tap the search icon (magnifying glass) and start typing their name, or tap the Friends icon (two heads).
 This button (which also has three horizontal dots) is beneath your friend’s profile image.



If you don’t see this option, this means your friend’s privacy settings do not allow for friend suggestions.
 You can scroll down the list until you find the person you want, or you can start typing their name into the “Search Friends” field at the top of the page.
 Both friends will receive invitations to add one another as friends.
