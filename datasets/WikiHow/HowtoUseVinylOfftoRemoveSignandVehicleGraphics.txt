wipe vinyl-off onto only the vinyl you want to remove using:

@summary
pad sponge foam brush fine nap roller paper towel, etc.

@summary
for best results, warm surfaces immediately before removal.

@summary
allow a few minutes dwell time(very little waiting needed)

@summary
vinyl-off penetrates the vinyl and attacks the adhesive behind it.

@summary
lift an edge and pull.

@summary
remove any remaining adhesive by either re-applying vinyl-off or applying adhesive –off.

We also recommend starting with a small area and determining the best method of dwell time, amount of heat, and angle of pull.

A little goes a long way. “Less is More”







,


Warm to the touch. Sun warmed on a warm day is perfect!






Non-Flammable and no toxic fumes! So you can use a heat gun or propane to warm the surface even indoors!







, You won’t usually see changes to the vinyl.






Dwell time will vary based on vinyl thickness and age.



The vinyl will come off in larger pieces because it has been rejuvenated. Most of the adhesive should come with the vinyl.

If installing new graphics after the removal,we recommend using isopropyl alcohol (IPA)to make sure that no oily residue from the other solvents is being left behind on the surface.
