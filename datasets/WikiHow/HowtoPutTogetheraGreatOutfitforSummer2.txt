again, start with a cute top.

a cute mini or a pair of skinny jeans are great for simple evening wear.

depending on where you are going, you can wear a nicer pair of sandals or heels.

 Glam it up this time around. Maybe a brighter color or a little sparkle. (Just make sure you don't look like a 6 year-old playing dress-up.)

, If you are not comfortable in either, wear a pair of great trouser styled dark wash jeans. The dark wash will make you look thinner.
 Gladiator sandals work great for a night out.
