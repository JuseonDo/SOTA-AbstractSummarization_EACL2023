 You'll be needing eight if you also want a spare, unevolved Eevee. Catching an Eevee in Pokémon Platinum is extremely difficult, but you can get your first one from Bebe in Hearthome City or in the Trophy Garden.


Breeding Eevee is the best option. Be sure to have a female Eevee or one of it's evolved forms, and another Pokémon in it's breeding group. To breed them, put two Eevee, one male and one female, in the Solaceon Daycare. Wait for a while and you will get a Pokémon egg that will hatch into an Eevee. Or, put Ditto and Eevee (any gender) in and you will get an Eevee egg.;
, Water Stones are found on Route 213 which is in the Solaceon Ruins. You can also get one on Route 230 if you have the Dowsing App on your Poketch.
 Fire Stones are found Solaceon Ruins, Fuego Ironworks (near Floroma, by surfing), and on Stark Mountain if you have the Dowsing App on your Poketch.
 Thunder Stones are found on Sunnyshore, by unearthing while underground, in Solaceon Ruins and Route 299 with the Dowsing App.
 This will take some time, so be patient. Also, make sure you are close enough to the moss rock, otherwise you might get an Espeon or Umbreon.
 Again, be close enough to the rock or you'll get another evolution. This will take more time than using one of the stones.
 Be careful that you are not close to the moss rock or the ice rock, or it will fail. Make double sure that you have enough friendship.
 Here it is the same, make sure you have enough friendship and are not close to the rocks. If you are press B while its evolving.
