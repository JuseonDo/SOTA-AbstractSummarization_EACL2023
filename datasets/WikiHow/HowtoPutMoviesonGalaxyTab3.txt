If you have a memory card installed in your tablet, another directory will appear beside the “Internal memory” folder. Click that if you want to transfer the movie into the memory card.
 Once you’re at the desired directory where you want to place the movie, open the directory where your movie is located.

DO NOT unplug the device while the computer is still transferring the movie file. This can cause data corruption. Wait for the transfer to finish, which you will know when the progress bar disappears and the file is present in the tablet’s directory.
