 This is Oracle's website, who develops the Oracle database as well as many other tools.



It is in the left column under Databases. The latest version of Oracle Express is 11g. In the future, this will get upgraded to 12c, but the position of the link and the rest of the functionality should be the same.



You need to accept the license agreement by clicking in the radio box to continue to download the file. There is a link to the License Agreement on the page.


There are versions for Windows 64 bit, Windows 32 bit, and Linux. Click on the link for the version that matches your operating system.



You'll need an account to download Oracle Express. The fields are self-explanatory, and once you have filled them in, click Create Account.
, Wait for it to download.
,

Windows has a built in tool for extracting files, if you haven't installed one yourself.
 It's in the folder you just extracted the downloaded file to.
,,


You'll need to enter a password for both of these Oracle accounts on your database. You can make up a password here, and they can be the same. You'll need to remember this password for logging in to the database later.
 The database will then be installed on your computer.
