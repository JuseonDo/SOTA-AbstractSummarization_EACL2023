 You will be placing the finished haystacks onto this.
 Place a large saucepan on the stove, and add in the sugar and corn syrup. Turn the heat to low/medium and wait for the sugar to dissolve. Stir the mixture often with a spatula so that it does not burn or scorch.
 Keep stirring until everything is smooth and melted together. Don't worry, the mixture will harden again once it cools.
 You will finish making your haystacks here.
 Try to use a rolling motion, so that you are always bringing the mixture from the bottom of the pot to the top. Be sure to stir gently, so that the cereal does not break.


Try to use a cereal without any added "frost" or sugar glaze.
 Don't worry about making the cookies neat; haystacks don't look very neat either. You can make the cookies as big or as small as you'd like. This recipe is enough to make about 24 cookies.
 This will take about 1 to 2 hours.If you are in a hurry, then place them into the freezer for about 10 minutes.
