You can check that in Settings>About Tablet>Android Version.
 Once downloaded (it should be in .apk format, which is a typical Android app installer), paste it into your Internal SD card or External SD card.


Do this by hooking your device up to your computer and pasting it to your desired data storage.
 Once transferred, run the installer from the data storage where it is located.


It should install just like a normal app installer. Scroll down until the end on the Terms and Conditions, and tap “Agree.”

, The tablet should reboot. There should be some text on the top left saying “Unlocking Device.”


It may take a bit, so wait for it to finish. Once complete, it should say “Device Unlocked.”
You now have an unlocked bootloader on your TF700.
 Rooting must be done with a tablet version of Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean. If not, look around for sources, as doing so should take a whole new tutorial.
 It should unlock Developer Options under the System Section.

, Now, follow the instructions on the screen.
 Once the program has finished, press any key and your device should reboot.
 Once the device has booted up again, look into your home screen and find the SuperSU app. If it isn’t there, it is likely that it is in your App Drawer.


Congratulations! You have rooted your TF700 successfully.
