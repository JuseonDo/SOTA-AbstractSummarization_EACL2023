, Leave the lead of the rope (the bottom part of the "S") long so that you can tie it to something when you've made the noose.
 Compress the "S" shape until all three rows of rope are nearly on top of each other, with only a few inches in between them.
 Pinch them tightly until the ends fan out to create a bow-tie effect.
 Wrap it from the right side to the left, leaving about three to four inches of the rope unwrapped. You should be left with a loop and a string on the left end, and just a loop on the right end of the "bow tie."

,, Use your thumb to hold down the short piece of rope that you just worked through the loop on the left-hand side so it bends over the loop.
 If this part of the loop begins to pull on the free rope instead of the loop, pull on the other side of the bow.
 Adjust the noose until the coils look nice and tight and the loop is the size you wanted.
 Don't use it on yourself or othersâ€”not even as a joke. Use the noose for a Halloween decoration, or when you're fishing or boating.
