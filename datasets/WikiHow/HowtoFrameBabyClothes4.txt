 The framed clothes should be hung on a nail that is firmly in the wall to prevent it from falling if it is bumped. The parent could use wall anchors to give additional support, especially when displaying larger shadow boxes.
 If more than one picture frame or shadow box will be displayed in the same room, it is important to space them out so that they do not look crowded and make the overall display unattractive.
 It is important to avoid hanging framed clothing where it will be exposed to direct sunlight. Aside from the fact that the sunlight would reflect on the glass and make the clothing difficult to view, the glass can magnify the sunlight and cause discoloration to the clothes over time.
