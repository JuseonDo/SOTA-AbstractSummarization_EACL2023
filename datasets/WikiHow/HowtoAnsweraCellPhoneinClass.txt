 Look around and check out the faculty around you; make sure they aren't interested in what you are doing. However, realize that teachers see a LOT more than they let on...;
, Slip your hand into your pocket and pull it out under your desk. Hang your phone down near the ground so it looks like your picking something up, or put it in your pencil case/coat pocket and pretend to be looking for something.
 Under no circumstances answer a phone call at anytime in a classroom. The bathroom, however, is a great place to answer the phone, as teachers are not present.
 If you are expecting the call and are just awaiting the info the caller intends to pass along, simply answer discretely and hold the phone up to the non-teacher ear and listen. Simple as that, then just slide it back into its place of holding

, Try not to look suspicious and keep looking back up to check whether your teacher is looking at you. But be careful, if you look back too much, the teacher may get suspicious.
, it can go on your lap or right on your desk! Or go to the bathroom, and text there.
 Lean your head towards and sort of hand the phone, so that you look like you're leaning your head against your hand because you are tired or bored.Also ask a question so the teacher knows you're "listening". Also look to someone who is looking at you and pretend to have a conversation with them. You should be wearing a hood when you do this though
