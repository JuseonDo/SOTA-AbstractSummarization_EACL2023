 Piggy back your tunes (use BINGO and Mary Had a Little Lamb, etc) and make up the words to suit every day activities. Put the spelling of their names to music and make it such a part of their lives that they cannot think without music being in their heads. If you play an instrument well, play it for them... often. Their brains can be "fine tuned" to (correctly) hear the music from a very young age.;
, They will find that performing is fun. Most musical theater groups will perform in a low key and non-threatening way. A hardy round of applause will culminate in a desire to do more and to do better each time.
 Get a voice coach that knows how to work with children.


At some point you are going to want them to join a children chorus. There is probably one in their school, so encourage them to join.
 This will help your child understand music more, and make it easier for them to excel in singing lessons.
 the radio, music in TV, and maybe some good tapes/CDs they might enjoy. A good idea is to put some classical music on their bedside when they go to sleep. Not so loud as they cannot sleep, but at a level in which they an still listen.
 while doing chores, cooking meals, in the car to the radio etc. Sing songs your child knows and encourage them to join in.
 This could include open mic nights, karaoke, talent shows, Etc. Before you do this however, watch talent shows on TV and see if your child shows an interest in that area. If so, then you can start taking them to different events

, Your manager will look for jobs that are available, make deals, and other such things.
