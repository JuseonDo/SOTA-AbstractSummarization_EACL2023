, You can't go Kayaking without a boat.
 Depending on how long you are camping will determine how large of a water jug you will need, it is very important that you do not drink or refill your water jug at the lake where you are Kayaking. The lake water contains bacteria and other contaminants that can be a danger not only to your health but that of your your friends and family. This is why you should not drink the water from the lake, so be sure to bring more than one water jug if you have to.
,,, To brush your teeth, you will obviously need toothpaste.
 Bring 2 small ones and a big one. One for your hair (if you have a lot of hair), another one for extra needs (a just-in-case washcloth). A big one is to dry off your whole body!

, When you're out in the dark, it can be scary and you never know what is out there. Bring lots of extra batteries.
 If you're coming with other people, they can entertain you as well.
 You don't want to get bitten by mosquitoes on your trip. A popular bug spray is "off." Get the clip on so you won't fuss with spraying it in your eyes!
