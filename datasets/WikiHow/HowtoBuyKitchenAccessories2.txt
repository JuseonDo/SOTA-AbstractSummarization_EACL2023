@article
 Make a list of the functions and/or features you need a kitchen appliance to have.
 Read customer reviews and product information. Consider its durability and energy-saving or efficiency qualities along with its included features or other qualities that concern you.
 You can rearrange the appliances around more easily or take them with you if you move.
 These will save room in the kitchen and be less expensive than buying the appliances separately. An example is a combination coffee and espresso maker.
