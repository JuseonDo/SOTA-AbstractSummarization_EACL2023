 Gold and silver look amazing with navy.
 Beyonce looked amazing when she made her first post-baby appearance rocking a tangerine dress and wearing cobalt blue nail polish.
 This icy twist on traditional blue pairs well with white and silver.
 Sky blue looks great with a white outfit, especially if you add some sky blue jewelry to call attention to the color.
