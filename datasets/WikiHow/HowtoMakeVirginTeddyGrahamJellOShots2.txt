 Allow Jell-O to cool slightly before transferring to the cups.
 If you plan to add gummy sharks, turtles or fish, add the candy in as the Jell-O cools in the large bowl.
 For speedier set time, skip the fridge and place in freezer for two hours.
 Measure/compare the fruit roll up to the Teddy Graham size. You want to cut a towel that can accommodate the entire cookie with a little overlay.


Cut enough “towels” for your sun bathing Teddy Grahams. Lay each towel on plastic wrap to prevent the towels from sticking to the surface.
 Measure across the Teddy Graham’s eyes and cut a small strip that will be used to cover the bear’s eyes. Cut enough sunglasses to accommodate each bear.
