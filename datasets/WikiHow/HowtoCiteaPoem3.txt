@summary
begin your blockquote on the next line, after your introduction.

@summary
indent twice.

@summary
punctuate the poem exactly as it reads in the original.

@article
 A block quote is also often called a long quotation.
 This will link the poem to what you are discussing in your paper, essay or article.


End your introduction with a colon. For example, when writing about Barrett Browning's poem and preparing for a block quote, you might say: Barrett Browning shares how she loves here:

, It should be set apart.
 The entire blockquote should be aligned at the second indentation within the body of your work. This will continue to provide a separate feel to your blockquote.
 You will not use backslashes. Instead, you will mirror the lines of the poem you cite.
 For example, if you cite several consecutive lines of Barrett Browning's poem, after your blockquote you would put: (7-11) without punctuation.
