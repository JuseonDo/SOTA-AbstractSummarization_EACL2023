, Any flavor will suffice. Don't worry about trying to "float" the Baileys; it will settle to the bottom regardless.


If you don't have any of the creamy beige lying around, you can make your own (although it's definitely the harder of the two options). Or, as a much easier substitute, off-brands (like O'Grady's or St. Brendan's, just to name two) are much cheaper.
 You must do this in the same shot glass, as this glass will be dropped into your pint glass to drink.


Bushmill's works, too, as does any other similar Irish whiskey.
 Grasp the rim and hold it above your glass of Guinness. At this time, take a deep breath, work up a thirst, and start getting into the zone.
 Slide the shot glass down the inside wall of the pint glass until the top edge is barely above the surface of the beer.
 But go fast -- the slower you go, the more it has a chance to curdle. The more it curdles...the more you'll regret your decisions. This drink goes from remarkably delicious to remarkably regrettable in seconds.
