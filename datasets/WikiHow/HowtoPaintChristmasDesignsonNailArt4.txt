 For this finger, make it a light brown (or tan) circle coming up from your nail. You can use a makeup brush, the brush it came with, or even a dotting tool.
 


To make the antlers, dip a makeup brush, dotting tool, or even a toothpick in dark brown (or if you used tan, a light brown) polish and make a line with two or three smaller lines coming up.






To make the nose, either paint it with a red polish, or dot it with a dotting tool.






To make the beginning of the eyes, make two large dots where you want the eyes to be.
 Once it is dry, finish the eyes with a slightly smaller white dot on the black, and a slightly smaller black dot over that.
 Put on a top coat, let it dry, and you're done! Now you can wear this cute design while doing anything this Christmas. Happy Holidays!
