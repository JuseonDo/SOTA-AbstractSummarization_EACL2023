 It can even be kids stuff. The best things are glow sticks, glow body paint, etc. Have a great love for these items.;
, Sequins are great to wear and they are flashy! A plain tank top is perfect for partying. If you can, find some glow in the dark clothing such as a jacket or sneakers.
 Have at least seven glow bracelets on both of your arms. Plus, try finding glow nail color!

, Wear glow in the dark lipstick or maybe even glow eye shadow.
 Always be in a party mood. Sing or hum quietly when people are around. Glow on! If people are giving you a hard time, dance when you get home or if you are fierce enough, dance it front of them! No one should ever ruin your happy mood.
 Both are lively genres of music.
 It's mean and rude to others. Remember, you want to be happy, so let everyone be happy too by showing them.
 It's natural and it shows how unique you can be. If you have curly hair or straight hair, keep it that way! Everyone's beautiful!

, It shows that you aren't serious about things in life that makes people worry too much.
 Make your world light up at night by using glow paint for your walls. If you can't do that, but some glow stars and slap them right on your wall. It doesn't have to be stars though. There's plenty more items.
