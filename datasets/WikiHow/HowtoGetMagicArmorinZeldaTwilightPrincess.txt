@article
 Go into Malo Mart in Kakariko Village and pay the old Goron that's holding up a sign 1000 Rupees. If you don't have 1000 Rupees, then you can pay him partially.;
, He will give you a barrel of Hot Spring Water. While dodging the different enemies, run to the bridge and throw the water onto the Goron. He will smash the rock and give you a Heart Piece. If you miss, go back to the Goron Elder for another barrel of Hot Spring Water.
 Donate 200 Rupees to the old Goron in Malo Mart. This will open up a new branch in Castle Town.
 Go to the center of Castle Town, then go into the new shop and buy the Magic Armor for 598 Rupees. You can also buy other stuff at discounted prices.
