 You can use any types or brands you prefer, but consider 1800 tequila, Puerto Rican or Jamaican rum, RÃ©my Martin or Hennessy cognac, and Russian vodka.;
, If you can't find any, you can use any other type of hot sauce.


Instead of Hot sauce, you could use ginger beer.
 Make sure that the lid is tight so that the mixture doesn't leak.
 Place a few ice cubes into a shot glass first. Then, carefully pour the mixture over the ice.
 Be prepared for a strong taste. The Suicide Shot is not reputed to be very pleasant, hence the name.
