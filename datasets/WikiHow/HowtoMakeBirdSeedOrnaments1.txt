 Microwave the water for about 30 seconds. The water should be hot to the touch but does not need to boil.;
, Only whisk the gelatin into the water long enough for it to dissolve.
 Stir the corn syrup long enough for it to dissolve.
 The two should be thoroughly combined.
 Use a large spoon to mix all ingredients well until a thick, sticky mass forms.
 You can use any cookie cutter shape you want, but larger shapes tend to be easier to work with than smaller ones and may attract more birds.
 Wax paper or nonstick cooking foil can also be used.
 You will need to work directly with the sticky bird seed mixture, and cooking spray will reduce the amount of seed that gets stuck to your skin.
 Press the seed mix into the cookie cutter with your hands until it feels firm and compact.
 Immediately remove it after inserting it into the seed to create a hole. The hole will allow you to tie the ornament onto the tree. You can create the hole anywhere, but the closer it is to the center, the sturdier the ornament will be and the longer it will last.
 Do so carefully, "wiggling" it free and gently holding the seed in place with your fingers if necessary.
 You may need to spray the cookie cutter with additional nonstick spray after every one or two moldings.
 Allow them to sit in a cool spot, such as a basement or refrigerator.
 Tie the string, leaving enough empty space to slip the loop over a tree branch.
