 Ideal flowers include dried rose petals, dried lavender, dried pansies and the like. You'll also need a vanilla or mocha body spray along with 3/4 of a cup of the dried coffee grounds.
 Lay them out in a thin layer.
 Don't overdo this, the scent shouldn't be too intense. You can always add more if needed.
, Allow to sit for 2 weeks, to let the scents infuse. You may find it needs longer, up to 6 weeks, to smell its best.
 This will reveal the scent. Choose a place to put the potpourri bowl, to allow the scent to waft around your house.
