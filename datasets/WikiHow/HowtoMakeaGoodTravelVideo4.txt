 For first time travel video makers, this is easiest done off-camera after you have been to your travel destination. You can edit in your on-camera sound bites later. Your narration is like a map, it is the story you are telling. Having this down first will help you decide which shots and sound bites you need. If you want to try to do this on-camera, you will have to be prepared at each location to record narration.
, Take no more than 2 to 3 minutes. You need some spaces in your video without voice-over, so narration should be shorter than actual run time.
 Remember to pause between sentences so you can edit your audio.
