 If you can't read the characters, that is okay. The phonetic sounding is not difficult to pick up.


"Am-ar Nahm"

, Note how there is a word after your name -- "hai." This translates literally to "My name Nick is." This is grammatically correct in Hindi.


"May-rah nahm _____ hey"You use the same phrase in Urdu. It is written out as "میرا نام ____ ہے.", Note that there is a word "desu" that comes after your name in Japanese. For simpler speaking, you can say, "I am ____," or "Watashi wa Nick"' desu."


"Wat-a-shee no na-my wah ______ dehs"
Wat-a-shee wah ____ dehs"

, There are several versions of an introduction in Tagalog, all of which are easy to pick up. The word for name, "pangalan"



Casual: Ako si ___ → " "AkOH see"

Polite: Ako po si ___ → "AkOH poh see"

Formal: Ang pangalan ko ak___ → "An pan-nall-en co ack", This is in the Mandarin dialect. Chinese is not just about accent but also inflection, which completely changes the meanings of words. This is one you should absolutely listen to examples of."Wuo - duh - meeng -- tza -- shuu _____"
For a simpler translation, try "Wuo Jiao ___"In Cantonese Chinese, use the phrase "Ngo kui tso.", Things might get difficult in Cambodia, Vietnam, or Laos, but this phrase can help start introductions.


"Ka-nohm ch'moo-ah", Some speakers drop the first word, sticking instead with " tôi là ___."


"Ten Thoy la", Thai is a gendered language, so make sure you use the right form. The last word, though hyphenated below, should be smushed together.Male: "pohm chee-ew"
Female: "dee-shaun chee-ew"
