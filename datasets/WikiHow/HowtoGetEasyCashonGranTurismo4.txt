 If you're just starting out in a new game, a Toyota Supra is recommended and can be bought in the Used Car Showrooms.


If you have Gran Turismo 3 game data, you can transfer credits from the game and have 100,000 credits.

,, It's called Capri Rally (easy).
 The track is a little different than normal races, that's why it's called "Special Conditions". When racing don't hit the other racer or walls, otherwise, you will get 5 second penalties which force you to go a max of 31 mph (50 km/h) for 5 seconds. It doesn't seem like much but it can add up if you do it a lot.



This car sells for 265,624 credits! This is more than twice the amount to buy a Dodge Viper or a BMW M5 and tuning it up!







, You have now made 275,624 Credits (375,624 if you have Gran Turismo 3 game data) in a fairly short time, if you didn't mess up on the races.
 If you want a fast race car, repeat almost 20 times for a Toyota GT-One or any race car costing 4,500,000 credits. For a shorter option, race cars costing 1.2-1.4 million credits are almost as fast.
