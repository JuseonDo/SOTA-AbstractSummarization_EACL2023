, The mango juice is for the popsicle. Frozen fruit juice made out of real fruit makes a fruit popsicle!


If you don't have mango juice, try another fruit juice (e.g. orange juice).
 If you have popsicle freezer molds, great (you can skip the next step). If not, you can use small yoghurt containers (or something similar).
 Cover your container with aluminum foil (The foil should hold your stick in place while the popsicle freezes).


If you don't have popsicle sticks (or something similar), you can use a teaspoon. Hold the teaspoon in the center of the yoghurt container, then place the foil on top of this, piercing a hole in the foil to hold the spoon upright.
