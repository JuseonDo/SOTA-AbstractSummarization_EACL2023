 The pot should be large enough to hold the potatoes, and you should have enough water to cover the potatoes completely.
 This will help to flavor the potatoes if you don’t like them plain.
 You can use tongs, or if you don’t have tongs you can gently slip them on with one hand; make sure the potatoes are as close to the water as possible, or even partially submerged, so that you avoid scalding yourself with hot water.
 To check if they’re ready, spear one with a fork. If the fork goes through the flesh easily, they’re cooked.
 You can either strain them or pour them directly into your clean sink to drain.
 Hold the fork with your non-dominant hand. The fork should go directly through the middle of the potato so that you do not have to touch the hot potato with your fingers.
, The peel should slip off easily as you move your knife. Be careful not to cut off too much of the white flesh. Use tongs to handle the potatoes if they are too hot to touch after they are peeled.
 Then, prepare the potatoes according to your recipe.
