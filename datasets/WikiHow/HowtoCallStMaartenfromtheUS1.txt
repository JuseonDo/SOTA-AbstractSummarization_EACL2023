 This is the country code for St. Maarten, as well as the United States., This Caribbean island is split into roughly two halves. The Northern half of the island is a French collective, and is not part of the North American Numbering Plan. The Southern half of the Island is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands., In total you will have 10-digits, just like a US number., Long distance fees and/or cell phone minutes will apply when calling St. Maarten as they would when calling a US number.
