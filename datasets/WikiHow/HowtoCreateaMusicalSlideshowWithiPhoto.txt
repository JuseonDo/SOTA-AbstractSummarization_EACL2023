, You can use songs you have bought from the iTunes store, and you should not use any song that you do not have express permission to use.
 That means scanning your photos and importing them into your iPhoto library and ensuring that your music is in your iTunes library as well.
 From the File pull-down menu, select “new album.” Name it whatever you want, and then go back to your main library. You can drag and drop photos into your new album as you browse through your main library.
 This will put you into a slideshow creation/editing tool set. You will have one photo in your slideshow. If it isn't one you want for your final product, delete it.
 Decide which photo you want to appear first, then drag and drop it into your album. Continue with this until you have all your photos in the slideshow in the order in which you want them to appear. If you’re going to do this the easy way (letting iPhoto time the music for you), don’t use too many photos. I’ve maxed out at 44 photos to a song that was about 2:12, or about three seconds per photo.
, Drag and drop the song(s) for your slideshow into it.
 A list of iTunes playlists will appear. Pick yours.
 as needed. When you have finished, pull down the “share” menu and click “export.” This will turn you slideshow into a Quicktime .mov file. The transcoding takes a bit of time, so be patient.
 Open it and play it to make sure everything is the way that you want it to be. If it’s fine, you’re ready to upload it to youtube. Follow the instructions on the website, and you’re good to go.
 Just check your compressed file to make sure there are no audio or syncing issues introduced in the compression process (play the converted file – if it looks/sounds okay, cool). I use iSquint, because it’s easy. And free.
