@summary
decide on the material - you can use anything from plywood up to an oak or maple veneer.

@summary
plywood is inexpensive and relatively easy to work with; mdf is smooth and easy to cut, however, it can be easily dented; laminate, which is fiberboard covered with a layer of plastic impregnated paper and is very strong and durable, comes in many colors.

@summary
if you have access to a table saw, you'll want to mitre cut the edges at a 45 degree angle to make a nice smooth seam.

@summary
cut the boards to the desired sizes.

@summary
put a bead of wood glue on the joints.

@summary
tack the boards together with small wood nails.

@summary
create the frame of the box.

@summary
fill the frame with boards.

@summary
allow the glue to set.

@summary
create the frame for the lid.

@summary
paint the box, apply primer then coat it with paint.

@summary
attach the lid to the blanket box with a hinge or hinges (depending on the size of the box).

@summary
if desired, you can add lid closers and a catch to the outside.

your blanket box is now ready to use.

, If you want for a more environment friendly material you can go for recycled wood.
 You can also get lumber with an oak or maple veneer, which is a thin layer of more expensive wood over a less expensive substrate. It can be stained and finished like solid oak or maple, but is much more economical; solid oak or maple would be very expensive, hard to find, and more difficult to work with.
 If not, you can butt-joint the edges together, but you'll have to do a fair amount of sanding to achieve a smooth finish on the ends.
,, Place clamps on the boards to hold them in place until the glue dries.



Using a nail set, punch the heads of the nails beneath the surface of the wood. Cover the holes with some wood filler and allow to dry. If you cut at a 45 degree angle, sand the edges smooth and apply a bead of latex caulking (if you're painting) or wood filler (if you're staining) along the seam.



Move your way up and all the sides of the box.






Make sure you adhere the wood with wood glue first then reinforce it with nails.



Sand off the wood filler and wipe down any dust.



Fill the frame with wood and set aside.



Allow to dry overnight.
 Holding the hinge to the top side of the box, mark all the screw holes with a pencil. Temporarily screw the hinge to the box and having someone else holding the lid up and on top of the hinge, mark the screw holes from the hinge on the lid.


Always ensure that the moving part of the hinge lies on the outside of the box.






Screw the hinge to the lid first, then bring it over and attach the hinge to the blanket box.
Always attach the hinge last, after all painting and finishing is completed.
