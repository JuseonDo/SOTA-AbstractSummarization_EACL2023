 Start by making a simple chain. You can make the chain as long or as short as you want it to be. Just keep in mind that this will serve as the backdrop for your motifs, so make sure to make it large enough to sew all of them onto.For example, you could make a small backdrop by chaining 40, or make a large backdrop by chaining 150. Itâ€™s up to you and what you need to complete your design.
 To begin your first row, single crochet into the tenth chain from the hook. This will make a small chain loop., Next, chain six stitches, skip three chains and then single crochet into the base chain. This will create another chain loop. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row., When you get to the end of your row, make a chain of nine for your turning chain. This will help to provide slack to work the next row and it will also serve as your first chain loop., Start your new row with a single crochet stitch into the next loop in your row. Then, chain six stitches. Then, skip three and single crochet to connect the stitches. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row. Follow the last chain of six with a single crochet stitch.
Chain nine and turn your work again and then repeat the second row until your backdrop is the length you want it to be.
 When you have finished several motifs and your background is complete, thread a needle with the same color thread as your yarn and then begin sewing your motifs onto the background. You can place them however you like.

You may want to start by pinning them on to see how you would like to arrange them, and then sew them in place when you are happy with the arrangement.
