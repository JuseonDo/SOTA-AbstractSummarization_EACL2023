 This step is important because some Windows XP systems are not compatible with Windows 7. If you have a custom built PC, make sure you have the correct hardware requirements before you upgrade. Run the Microsoft compatibility checker, which can be downloaded for free at Microsoft.com. If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, do not upgrade to Windows 7 and consider buying a new PC.;
, Determine which copy of Windows you want to install. For the average home user, Windows Home Premium is the best option.
 Do this by going to you computer manufacturer’s website. If you have a custom built PC, download each driver manually.
 If your PC has more than 4 GB of RAM install the 64 bit version, but make sure that your CPU is 64 bit capable. Otherwise, install the 32-bit version of Windows.
 On the installation screen, click “custom install” option. Windows XP cannot upgrade to Windows 7. Clean install means installing a new copy of Windows on the hard drive,which will wipe out all your personal data and reinstalling all the software drivers, files, and programs manually.
