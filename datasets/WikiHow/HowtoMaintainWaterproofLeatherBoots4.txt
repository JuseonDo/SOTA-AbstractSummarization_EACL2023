 Water-based products are good for most leathers and other mixed materials. Oil-based products are only intended for full-grain leather. They may darken and over-soften the leather, especially if used on standard hiking boots.
 Your boots should be slightly damp when you apply a water-based proofing product. Dampness helps the product seep deeper into the leather's fibers.
 The method of application may vary depending on the type of waterproofing you purchase.
, Pay special attention to the seams and joints, since water tends to leak in at these areas most frequently.
 Cover the entire exterior of the boot and pay special attention to the seams.
 You may have to squeeze the bottle as you rub to get the product out of the container. Apply liberally to the entire surface and all the seams.
 These waterproofing products are not intended for rubber.
 Usually, there will not be much to remove at this point.
 This allows the product more time to seep into the fibers.
