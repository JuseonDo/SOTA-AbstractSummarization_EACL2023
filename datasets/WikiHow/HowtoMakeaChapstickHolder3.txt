 Either use heavyweight fabric or add iron-on interfacing to strengthen thinner fabric.
 They should measure about 5cm (2 inches) by 22.5cm (9 inches). Cut the fabric to this measurement.
 Pin in place if needed, then stitch the two long sides and one short side together, allowing for a 6.35mm (1/4 inch) seam. Snip off the base corners diagonally.
 Push out the corners with a knitting needle or similar item.
 Iron the whole piece, including the turned-down part.
 Iron in place, then stitch a neat hem around it to create a pouch.
 Fold to about 2.5cm (1 inch). Iron in place.
 Sew along the open edge, catching both the folded part and the back of the fabric. This will keep the D-ring firmly in place.
 Then attach the D-ring to your keyring or bag ring and you're all set to never lose that chapstick again!
