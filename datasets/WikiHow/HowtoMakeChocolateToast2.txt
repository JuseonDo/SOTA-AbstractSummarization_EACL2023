,, Leave for 4 minutes, then turn over and toast the other side for 4 minutes. Or, heat for as long as it takes to be browned on both sides.
, Place the squares on each bread half. Leave about 1/2 inch (1.2cm) at the edge free of chocolate as it will melt into this area.
 Bake for 1 to 2 minutes or until the chocolate starts melting. It should have a glossy texture.
 Sprinkle a few small drops of olive oil onto each slice and season with a pinch of salt for each slice.


If you don't like the thought of oil and salt on the chocolate, skip; however, it does bring out a great flavor, which is why this is a popular method.
 Enjoy with a hot chocolate and some fresh berries in a side bowl.
