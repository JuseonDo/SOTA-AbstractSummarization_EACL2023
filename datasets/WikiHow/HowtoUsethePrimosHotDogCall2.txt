 Place your lips on D. Blow while gliding your lips to C. Sounding like a siren, it should be one note with zero breaks.;
, Place your lips between C and B. This should sound like this: "Bark, bark, hoooooo, hooooooo."

, Glide your lips from D to C. It should make a "hoooooo" sound, but shorter than the locator howls.
