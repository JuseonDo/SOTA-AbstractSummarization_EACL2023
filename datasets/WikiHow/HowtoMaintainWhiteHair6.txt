 With bleached hair some people may be able to go an entire week without washing the hair, the longer the better. Wash bleached hair as little as possible to keep it healthy and soft.
 To keep the condition of the hair optimal, use hot oil treatments. These are good for adding moisture if you lack moisture in your bleached hair.
, This will prevent your hair feeling dry the next day. Try washing conditioner off with cold water for a few weeks then gradually transition to washing your hair with cold water only, you'll get used to it! It may make a big difference in the health of your hair.
