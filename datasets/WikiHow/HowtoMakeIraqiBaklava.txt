Avoid rapid stirring because it may form sugar crystals in your syrup. Sugar crystals are disfavored because they can harden your syrup once it is cold.
  Let it boil for 10 minutes, and then set it aside and save it for later.


Do not add the green cardamom and the lemon juice before sugar melts completely, because it may burn them and the flavor will be lost. You may also add vanilla or cinnamon.
 Blend together the following items until you have a grain-like mixture. Then set aside:


½ lb. green peanuts
1 tbsp. sugar
1 tbsp. ground green cardamom
½ cup of melted butter
2 tablespoons rose water

,  Knead the dough until you have have created unified coherent dough.


If this is your first time kneading a dough, there are some helpful tips and videos on how to knead a dough at How to Knead Dough.
 Then flatten it out into extremely thin sheets using dough sheet roller or you can skip this part by buying fillo dough from a grocery store.
 Then deposit half of them in tray.

The last sheet should be buttered heavily to make it extra crispy.
 Place the tray in the oven at 180 ̊C, for 35 minutes.
  Then let it air dry for 2 hours. Air drying helps getting rid of the trapped water vapor.


Avoid pouring extra syrup before air drying the Baklava, it may remove the crispiness.
 you may spray some of the saved filling powder on top, of the Baklava (If desired).
