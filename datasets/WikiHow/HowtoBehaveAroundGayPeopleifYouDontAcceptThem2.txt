 Obsessing over what they do in the bedroom won't help you interact with them, and they'll probably think you're a creep. Instead, focus on the good and everyday parts of the person. For example, maybe Leslie is educated, compassionate, great with dogs, and helpful. Being LGBT doesn't rob people of personalities and admirable traits.


Ask about them about their hobbies and interests. Let them tell you stories about their lives. Knowing them as a person can make them feel less scary or strange to you., Try movies and TV shows that include LGBT people in their ordinary lives, like The Fosters and The Kids Are All Right. This can help you understand what it is like to LGBT.


Not all media is realistic. If the character is flat and stereotyped, and/or there are no LGBT people involved in the media creation, then there's a good chance it isn't accurate.
 They aren't automatically promiscuous or dangerous. Many of them are kind and caring people, who just want to love and be loved by a consenting partner.


Gay people are able to have long-lasting and happy relationships., Studies show that gay people are no more likely to be child molesters than straight people are.Furthermore, gay people aren't particularly any more promiscuous than straight people.Stop seeing gay people as depraved and oversexed, and realize that they can be ordinary people who do ordinary things.


Gay people are able to control themselves, just like straight people., In the US, the First Amendment (freedom of religion) states that people can practice the religion they wish, and religion cannot be forced upon them. It isn't legal to force someone into following your religious beliefs, whatever they may be. Thus, if your religion prohibits gay marriage, you are welcome not to marry someone gay, but you cannot use it to stop other people from marrying.
