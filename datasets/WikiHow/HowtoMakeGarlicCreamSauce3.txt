Consider topping with: red onion, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, artichoke hearts, chicken, or broccoli.
 Toss it with cooked fettuccine, penne, linguine or use it in a lasagna.


If using it in pasta, consider grating the zest of a lemon into your sauce. This will add a citrus note and cut some of the richness.
 Steaks are traditionally topped with a compound butter or rich sauce. Garlic cream sauce makes an excellent replacement.
 Shrimp, scallops and clams are especially good with the combination of garlic and cream.


Toss a little sauce into a seafood pasta for an even better combination.
 Dip bread sticks, crackers, or veggies. For an appetizer or party, set out a tray of breads, vegetables, sausages, and a bowl of the garlic sauce for easy dipping.
