Gmail drive is not an official tool maintained by Google. It is built by a third party developer that you need to trust in order to install. Install at your own risk.;

 The filter should put everything with "GMAILFS:" in the subject into the label. You should also have it skip the "inbox". This will prevent your inbox from filling up with Gmail Drive stuff.
