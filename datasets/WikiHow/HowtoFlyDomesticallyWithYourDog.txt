 If your dog is large, he will have to ride via cargo. Some airlines will not allow certain breeds such as Pit Bulls and Rottweilers. Make sure you do this in advance.;
, Will it be over or less than a week? The longer your trip, the more supplies you will need. Also, if you are staying at a hotel, make arrangements for your dog to stay at a pet-friendly hotel.
 Also, take your pet to the vet for a physical before the flight, so your dog is cleared to fly. He also needs health documents recently updated and all his shots to board the plane. Bring a copy of his medical records.
 This list should be helpful, though you should make sure you take anything else you feel necessary.
 That way, you know she is healthy. Sometimes, the vet will prescribe a mild tranquilizer to keep your dog calm during the flight. Have the vet also make sure the dog's micro chip is working if he has one.
 This may still happen, though. About two hours after that, give your dog a long walk and allow him to go to the bathroom.
 You are getting on your flight in an hour. Your Dog's crate should be airline approved. Put layers of very absorbent padding on the bottom of his crate and attach a pail of frozen water to the side of his cage. If it isn't frozen, it will spill during loading. Also, put a chew toy in his crate.
 The drive to the airport should be as calm as possible. At the airport, calmly take your dog through security and put him with the rest of your luggage, or where ever you are directed to put him.
 Also, ask a flight attendant to make sure that your dog is unloaded from cargo after the plane lands. After Landing, ask again so you are certain your dog is off of the plane.
 If it is okay, change his pee pads. Stroke him for a minute and crate him again. Then treat him and leave as calmly as possible.
