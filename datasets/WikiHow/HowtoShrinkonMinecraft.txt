 Don't make it too small. A four by five is a great size choice.;
, There should be space under the slabs. You can make a design if you want, but keep it wooden.
 If a minecart fits on your version then use a minecart instead of a boat.
 If you do this on creative you won't die of suffocation.


Know that you can only get in the boat if you are next to it, not on the slabs.
 This will be slower than moving on water.
 This hides the boat controls so that the viewer doesn't know you are in a boat.
