 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".


In selecting suitable fabric, you can select from an old corkboard in need of renovating––simply cover with fabric or paper first, or use a big piece of thick cardboard and cover it with felt or fabric.;
, Cut to size, making sure each ribbon length overhangs the back of the pinboard. Pull tight. Glue, staple or tack the ribbons in place at the back of the pinboard.
 Only this time, you'll need to weave the ribbon up and over each of the other diagonally placed ribbons that each of these diagonal ribbons cross over. This ensures that the ribbon provides good holding places for papers, etc. Once woven through and overhanging to the back, pull tight. Then, staple, glue or tack in place as before.
 Use something strong like ribbon, string or a commercially made sticky hook set.
 The pinboard can be used to hold favorite photos, business cards, pieces of paper, notes, pens, paperclips, keys, etc.
