 This is a sign that your child is now recognizing the urge to urinate.;
, They might pull at it, cry quickly and demand a change, or simply pull them off.
 They might follow you in and watch. Or they might clamber on it themselves and mimic other family members using the toilet. Some children even work it out for themselves!
