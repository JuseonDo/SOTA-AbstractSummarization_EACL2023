@article
 Actors should practice their lines. If you want to avoid getting many takes in your film, make them practice the lines and action combined.,, It is not always accurate, so remember to look with your own eyes, and review the film you take after each shot.


Remember: Anyone can record an image, but that is not making a film.
, You do not need to use an expensive program at all. With the right skills, a free program that came with the computer can make stunning films. Do not think you need to use the most expensive program out there!

, If you are serious about film-making, submit it to film festivals and send it to film agencies. Remember, the more publicity you get, the better short films you will be able to make in the future. And remember, everyone had to start somewhere!
