 To do this, you can use the Disk Cleanup utility included on the Windows systems, or download a freeware program such as CCleaner to do it for you. In Linux you can use Kleansweep or Bleachbit. Cookies and cache left behind by browsers can amount up to gigabytes of wasted space, so it is imperative they're deleted.;
, There is a myriad of tools available to do this. AVG Anti Virus is a good one to use. Download.com is a great place to legally obtain these tools.
 Windows XP includes a utility to do this, but a tool called Magical Defrag also exists, which automatically defragments your system during periods of inactivity.
 The more free space your computer has, the faster it will go. You'll be surprised how much space you'll free up and how much your computer's performance will increase.
 This can up your start up and boot down times a lot. CCleaner also has a feature that allows you to do the same thing (Tools--->Startup)

For Windows, select Performance and Maintenance and then choose "Rearrange items on your hard disk..." and "Free up space on your hard disk."
For Mac, go to the Applications Folder, select Utilities Folder then launch Disk Utility.
