 You should choose the color on how you feel or what kind of person you think you are. (e.g. pink if you feel cheery, dark purple if you're a little gloomy, etc.)

,, It helps the polish to become less clumpy and do its job better. It potentially makes your nails look better. Do not shake the nail polish container, as it will create bubbles.
, If you want better results, wait a minute or two to apply a second coat.
 Use it to de-smudge the smudges that you needed to put before in order for your nails to be full and look better then usual!

, Wait about five minutes before putting your hands in water or doing any other activity that could potentially mess up all your hard work!

, Soak a cotton ball or paper towel in acetone and rub at old polish until it comes off.;
, This prevents your nails from turning yellow.
 If you are having trouble choosing a color, see the suggestions below:


Purples and Reds go great with darker skin tones.
Blues, Greens, and Nudes look wonderful against medium shade skin tones.
Pinks, and most pastels look nice against lighter skin tones.
 Before you start painting, add a medium to thick layer of vaseline on the skin around your nail. Try not to get any on the nail, or you will have a hard time getting the nail polish to stay.
 If you want to add a design, do it now. Don't worry if you get some paint on your skin; the vaseline will keep it from sticking!

, While not necessary, this will help seal your nail polish and keep it from chipping.
 When they are completely dry, grab a cotton swab and use it to wipe away the vaseline.
 This will help remove any vaseline that the cotton swab didn't get.
 You should be free of smudges anywhere that the vaseline touched.
