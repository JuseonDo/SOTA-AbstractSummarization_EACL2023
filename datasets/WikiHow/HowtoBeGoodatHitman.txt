 Neutralize guards silently. When near a guard and you want to take their disguise, don't use the sedative because you only receive two. Just get your silver baller and use them as a human shield, knock them out then take their disguise. Also, conceal the bodies from guards.;
, Make sure that you know your surroundings.
 Guns lower your rating, and take a big hit in keeping you away from the silent assassin rating.
 Even guards. Remember you are paid to kill your target, and only your target. Unless you have to, sedate or knock out civilians or guards, but do not kill them.
 In order to do this, there must be no witness', so your target has to be on his own. Watch and stalk your target. Learn his routine, and find out all the places when he his by himself. There is always a time when your target is by himself, eg using the bathroom, eating his dinner privately, etc.
 Accident Kills are always your best choice if they're available.
