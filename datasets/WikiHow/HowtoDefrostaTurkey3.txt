 Cook the turkey until the meat begins to soften.
 You'll want to cook the bird until it reaches an internal temperature of 170 F (77 C).
 Liberally salt and pepper the turkey to give it at least some seasoning.
 If the skin begins to brown long before the meat is done, then remove the roasting pan from the oven. Place a tent of foil over the top of the turkey to slow down the browning process.
 For example, if the bird would normally cook in 6 hours, expect that cooking a frozen turkey will take about 9 hours.
