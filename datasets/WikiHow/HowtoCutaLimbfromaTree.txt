plan your cut.

@summary
cut the limb from the underside about 1/2 way through but stop before the saw binds.

@summary
make a second cut at ‘b’, slightly further out on the limb and from the top.

,

@summary
allow the branch to break free and fall under its own weight.

@summary
,

@summary
cut the remaining stub off from ‘e’ to ‘f’,(to prevent tearing the bark make a small cut at 'f' first) make the cut close to the main trunk.

@summary
cut flush with the outer edge of the branch collar, and healing will proceed much faster.
@article
 Decide which branch(es) you will cut and where. You may wish to cut a branch for aesthetic reasons (because it overhangs something or grows in a direction it shouldn't) or because branches are rubbing or damaged.


If you have any doubts about which branches to cut or how to cut them safely, hire a tree service.

Prune branches smaller than about 5cm (2 inches) in diameter with bypass loppers. Use the technique below for larger branches.;
, This cut should be made at ‘A’ in the picture above.

Don't cut into the "branch collar" of the limb being removed. This will actually inhibit healing.
Search "branch collar" images on your browser if you have trouble seeing it. The branch collar can be identified on most trees as a bulge where the limb meets the trunk but can be hard to see on young trees or trees that grow slowly.


Save your money, use clean, sharp tools and don't paint the cut. At one time it was common practice to paint tree cuts, but it's been shown to harm trees more than help.Leave the wound free to dry naturally.
