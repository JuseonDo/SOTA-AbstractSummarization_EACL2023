 Most important may be his back + A throw (when Mario spins around then throws the enemy). It is very useful to not only do damage, but to also surprise and then separate your opponent from yourself.;
, Timing is everything for this move. Practice and get better at this and you will start to become a better player.
 It may be a weak move, but it is an excellent juggling move. As an added bonus if you do that and time a meteor smash correctly, you can get a quick K.O.
 Use this a lot since it is a good way to get quick damage.
, It can deflect any ranged attack and, when your opponent is trying to get on to the stage, you can knock him off with no chance of recovery if timed right.
