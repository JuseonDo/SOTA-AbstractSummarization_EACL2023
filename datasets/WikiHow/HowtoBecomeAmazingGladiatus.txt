 Wrong. First, go to the tavern and get a quest. It is recommended to begin with "easy".;
, He will probably give you a quest to kill something on an expedition somewhere. Go on the expedition. It will give you xp, you will gain money from the Publican, and also the creature you killed will give you stuff

, That is normal. It will get your xp up and the chances of winning become greater.
 After a few expeditions you will probably be getting bored. Go to the training in the city and get a few of your levels up.
 Make sure you buy armor equal or less than your level. Don't waste your money.
