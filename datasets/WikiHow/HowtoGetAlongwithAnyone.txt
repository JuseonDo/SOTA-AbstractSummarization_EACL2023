@article
 Watch how they interact with other people. Keep a mental note.;
, You could also simply watch others to see how they react to this person.
 Maybe you overheard a conversation they had about a certain interest. Maybe you could just ask a quick question (if you were, say, at work) and see how they react to it. Or lastly, just simply introduce yourself. "Oh, hey, I haven't met you yet, I'm Danny", And see what happens.
 No matter how annoying you think they are, a smile could mean a lot of things. If they are nice, do the same. Everyone likes strangers to think they like them in some way.
 When they are around, be outgoing and show them how you are, what you like, without them knowing you are showing them. Similar to what you did to them earlier, but vice versa.
 Repeat all steps (especially the watching and learning) until this person starts approaching you. They will. It just takes time. Then start talking about the things that you have learned you will both be interested in.
 This will avoid any conflict.
 It will usually happen on its own, naturally, and over a period of time.
 Conversation will get more intense each time you communicate. Your instincts will tell you which direction to go.
 Nobody likes someone who spreads rumors and secrets.
