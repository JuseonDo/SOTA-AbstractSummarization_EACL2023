The down lead cable is the part of the rod that runs down along the tree's trunk. For trees with a diameter of less than 3 ft. (or 1 meter), use 1 down lead; for larger trees, use 2 down leads placed on opposite sides of the trunk. If you are using 2 down leads, repeat the following steps for each one.
,


The air terminal collects the positive charge from the ground and forces the lightning bolt to strike a concentrated point. The air terminal must be as high as possible to reduce the risk of damaging any part of the tree above it.
, Continue until you hit the ground.



The drip line is the area within which the three has roots. You want to guide the lightning bolt outside this area so as to prevent damage to the root structure.
To find the drip line, measure the circumference of the tree and divide by 2. Mark this distance from the base of the trunk in all directions.
