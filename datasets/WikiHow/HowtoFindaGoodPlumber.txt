 The most basic rule is to be sure that they're licensed and carry full insurance that protects you and your neighbour's property in the event of a catastrophe.;
, You can even ask to see some of the work they have done. Read their Facebook page and twitter feed to see how they are interacting with their customers

, At the very least, this tells you they shouldn't disappear on you. Theoretically, reputable companies should last, while disreputable ones fade. But sadly, that's not always the case.
 Some companies strip their jobs back to the absolute minimum so they can come in at the lowest price, but the work won't last the longest possible time. Ask the company that is more expensive why their price is at that level, so you can determine if there is a difference.
 Is it money back? Is it limited in any way? Is it written on your bid/quote? Plumbers with great belief in their performance standards put their money where their mouth is.
 Some plumbers prefer to provide quotes only when they are in front of the job so they get it exactly and 100% right. From a plumber's and customer's perspective, there's nothing worse than saying it will cost $X to fix and get to the home, only to find that its really $Y because of some complicating factor.
 The only way this will be truly accurate is if the plumber is in front of the work., The best way to find a good plumber is to have referrals from people you trust. Ask a friend, relative, or colleague you trust for a recommendation.
 If they've been working in the industry for a while, chances are they'll have some contacts. And if you call a plumber based on a reference, be sure to let the plumber know immediately who referred you. They might even give you a discount.
