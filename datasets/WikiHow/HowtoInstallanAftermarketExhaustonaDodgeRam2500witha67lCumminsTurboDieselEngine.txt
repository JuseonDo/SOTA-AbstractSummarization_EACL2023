,, (This will make it much easier to get the downpipe out from under the truck.) Remove the downpipe., Remove the hangers that are attached to the vehicle frame. Remove all factory exhaust with these instructions., This will accommodate the bigger size of the aftermarket exhaust., Starting with the downpipe, attach the aftermarket downpipe with the factory v band that was taken off earlier., (Most aftermarket kits come with the pieces of pipe labeled 1, 2, 3, etc.)

Make sure not to tighten all clamps until entire exhaust system is in place.
 The muffler should allow exhaust pipe to slide inside of it from either direction and, can be quite difficult at times a pair of pliers may be needed to stretch the ends of the muffler. (Hanging the muffler by yourself can be quite difficult; try finding a partner to help with this step.), Make sure all hangers are hung well; penetrating oil can be used to make the hangers slide through the rubber bushings easier.,, If everything checks out you have successfully completed removing the factory exhaust and installing aftermarket exhaust.
