 Rental properties in many countries must have smoke detectors. If you have them in your home, keep them in good working order and if you don't have any, get some, or ask your landlord to install some.
 The savings from reduced damages to appliances may offset the cost of this upgrade.
 This can be used to extinguish fires both when you are away and at home.
 Children are often both the cause and victims of fires, and should not be allowed access to matches or cigarette lighters. Consider getting a lockable box, and keeping matches and lighters locked up.
