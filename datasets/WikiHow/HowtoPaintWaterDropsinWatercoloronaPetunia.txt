@summary
on a piece of 11 x14" watercolor paper, draw a circle in pencil to indicate the petunia's shape and the amount of space it will take up on the paper.

@summary
continue shaping the flower by connecting the area between the dips with flowing, curved lines.

@summary
mask the three circles you made for the flower's center with bits of tape, masking fluid or plan to paint around them.

@summary
,

@summary
draw stems as long wavy lines.

@summary
continue laying out the entire page with circles for flowers, lines for stems and leafs.

@summary
set up a palette with red, violet, yellow and green tube paints.

@summary
add some droplets.

@summary
on the same side, within the droplet, run a line of body color with a small brush and immediately follow with a brush dampened with plain water to soften the colored line.

@summary
to finish the flower, paint the yellow circles at the center.
@article
 Indicate the center with three small circles, and with curvy lines radiating out from that center, divide the flower into five parts. Put a "U" at the ends of the lines to remind yourself that the petals dip at that point.;
, Use "V" shapes to indicate where the flower has pleats and ruffles.
, Double them to create a narrow space to fill with green paint.


Draw leaves as crescents. Notice that the veins come from a single point near the base of the leaf and radiate out like a fountain.
Draw a petunia in side view. Note that all the blossoms are joined to the base with a tiny, five pointed star.
 Follow the steps above for each flower. Be sure to add one flower that is waning. Later you can indicate its demise with its curled edges touched with brown paint., If you are using a paint box, activate the colors with drops of water. Make juicy puddles of well diluted red to make pink and diluted violet for lavender. Paint the flowers and the stems. Use a small, pointed brush for the stars at the flowers' base.
 A single light source is needed for doing water droplets, so indicate it with an arrow or piece of tacky note paper to remind you as you work. Draw a small circle where you want the drop and use a scrub brush to scrub the spot back to white. Allow this to dry. Accuracy is important, so follow the circle, starting at the half way point and on the opposite side of where the light is coming from, paint a cast shadow. Allow this to dry. Already the water spot is taking shape.
 Allow this to dry. On the opposite side draw a tiny circle for a highlight and use a very small scrub brush to remove any color on it. If it isn't as white as you would like, touch it with a drop of white opaque watercolor or acrylic paint.
 Then, give each petal a two or three main veins using a darker shade of body color and a tiny brush. Pull very delicate tributary veins to almost cover the petal. Don't forget to add little off shoots coming off the stems at various places.
