 You will need your membership identification number. You will also likely need some personal information, such as your address, your social security number, your driver's license number, and your date of birth.
 Make sure it is in accordance with the contract's specifications. Mention in your letter that you want your cancellation fee waived if you're eligible, as well as the reason why. Also note what documentation you are including with the letter. Include all your personal information; you only need to include the last four digits of your social security number and your driver's license number. Sign it.

 If you run into trouble after canceling -- if, for example, you find that you are being charged improper fees -- you may need to contact a particular person to address the issue.
