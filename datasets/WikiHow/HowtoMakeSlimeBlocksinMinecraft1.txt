 One theory is that they spawn more frequently on a full moon. You may have to check the moon before sleeping.


They also can be found if you see green chunks on the ground. But most of the time you have to play for a very long time to find them.;
, In total, you'll need nine slime balls to make a block.
 Head for your crafting table at your house.
 Use all the slime balls all over the squares.
 You now have a slime block.
