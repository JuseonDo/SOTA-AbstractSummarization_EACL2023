 A minimum requirement is a Bachelors degree, but a Masters will give you a competitive edge. Your course of study should give you full guidelines about how to become a corporate architect and cover topics like construction, design, architecture management processes, engineering, and building materials.;
, Apply for part time work in the architecture departments of local corporations. Look for jobs with architectural firms that specialize in the design of offices and commercial buildings.
 Join groups and professional associations for architects. Do volunteer work. Read magazines and books about news and trends in corporate architecture.
 Working for a corporation is different from working for a smaller design and architecture company. Getting accustomed to corporate politics, rules and structure at the beginning of your career will save the time and effort it takes to adjust later.
 You may need to work from home often. A clean, professional, organized environment is necessary.
, State requirements vary but usually include specific education, experience, and testing.
 This can be done through study groups or self study with books or online materials.
 Most states require a work history of 1 to 5 years before sitting for certification.
 Most states require a specified amount of educational hours or units each year to keep a license active. Education could include conferences, lectures, courses or self study. Look for opportunities that provide licenses and certifications.
 Set goals and stay on track. If your desire is to work as a corporate architect and you currently work in a different area of architecture, make moves toward your goal. Try to get involved with any commercial or corporate projects that your firm may be working on. Become specialized at commercial design instead of residential if your firm does both types of work.
