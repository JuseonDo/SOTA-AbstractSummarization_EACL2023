 What do you want your stallion to be doing? Do you want to make him be eating, or do you want him to run? This is the first step of every drawing.;
, Connect them with lines on the sides of the circles.
 Draw the neck stemming out of the larger of the two circles that represents where the jaw bones are.
 You may want to start out simple like everything else drawn so far, so you may want to start by drawing triangles instead of the full drawn out ears.
 Connect the body lines with the neck as shown in the image.
 Look at the image to see the anatomy of the front and hind legs and hooves, which are his feet.
 Draw it long and flowing if you like or you can do anything that you want with the horse's hair.
 Erase any lines that are unrealistic or unwanted and you're DONE!!!
