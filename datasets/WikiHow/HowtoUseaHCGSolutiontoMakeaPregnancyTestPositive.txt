 Dollar stores also sell pregnancy test, but for a more authentic look it is best to use brand name tests like CVS, Clearblue, First Response, e.p.t, and Answer. All pregnancy test work the same way; they test for the specific hormone called hCG.;
, Most pregnancy test come with the specified amount of tests (usually 1, 2, 3 or 5 test per pack), an instruction manual, and the box it came in.
 The hCG solution will yield positive pregnancy test results 100% of the time. The science behind pregnancy tests are to trigger the sensor that detects the pregnancy hormone hCG. My method of clinical testing allows for that trigger to take effect barring other methods that are messier and less hygienic (like paying a pregnant lady to urinate on a pregnancy test. Yuck!).
, Put the cap back on the test, and lay the test flat on the desk with the testing window facing up for viewing.
 If the test has not turned positive by now, add 20-25 drops (1mL) of water to the applicator.
 Dispose of your dropper and any paper towels used. Recap your hCG solution. Enjoy the benefits of owning a positive pregnancy test.
