, Do they suspect, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming or deceiving them in some way or another.
 These types will see hidden agendas to every action performed by others, even though this may not be the case. They show rigidity in their behavior and thoughts. this simply means that they are inflexible and giving someone the benefit of the doubt, is out of the question.
 This stems from a fear that the information will be used maliciously against them. In essence these people basically will trust no one. He or she will not reveal personal information to anyone. Not even his or her name on the phone.
 They are hyper sensitive to casual remarks or statements made by others. An innocent remark can be taken personally and blown out of proportion.
 The person will be unforgiving of insults, injuries or any other slight mistreatment they suffer in the hands of others. In other words they simply become fixated over petty and minor issues.
 These types will perceive attacks on his or her character which will not be apparent to others. They are quick to become angry easily or to become defensive and counterattack. This may add to the unpleasantness when hosting a conversation with these personality types.
 They always question the loyalty and fidelity of a spouse or sexual partner. They show a sense of extreme jealousy that stems from their lack of trust in others. They may phone other friends and family to confirm your story and demand an explanation for every second spent away from home, coming late from work etc. They may insist on answering the phone and wrong numbers etc may take on a special significance for them.
