 Read a book or do something to keep you busy while you wait.;
, Or if you can hear the TV turn off and see (from the crack of your door) the lights go off, wait a few minutes just to be sure everybody has left the room.
 If you sleep on the top of a bunk bed, (with socks on will help) climb down the ladder at a steady pace.
 Know if the door creaks if opened. Silently tip-toe out of your room, leaving the door slightly opened, when you come back.
 Beware of wooden floors or tiles, for wood may creak and tiles usually make noise from your feet (which is why you should wear socks/slippers).
 The only downside to headphones is that if somebody walks into the room, you won't hear them. If it is TV you are going to watch (or play video games), keep also a low volume, or no volume at all and put closed caption on. Be sure to set the lighting of your TV/computer on one of the lowest settings, so the people in the next room are less likely to see the light. If you are playing a small video gaming device such as a Game-boy or Nintendo DS, keep the volume down, once again, or no volume at all.
 Look under Tips to know what to do when they walk by or are close.
, Slowly open the door. Repeat when closing it.
 Careful when you are getting into bed, and try not to thump the wall.
