 Vinegar contains acetic acid, which effectively kills weeds and other plants.;
, Lemon juice contains high levels of citric acid and may also be effective either used with the vinegar or alone.
, Either dish washing or dishwasher soap, in liquid or powder form, may be a helpful addition to weed killer. The soap attacks the outer protective layer of the plant, making it more vulnerable to attack.
 You can use the full-strength solution, but many report success after diluting the mix by 50 to 90 percent. Start with a 50/50 diluted mix, and then mix up a more or less concentrated solution depending on the results you have.
 Set the nozzle to "stream" rather than "spray" if the weeds are growing close to plants that you do not want to kill. Weed killer does not discriminate: it will kill any plant it comes in contact with.
