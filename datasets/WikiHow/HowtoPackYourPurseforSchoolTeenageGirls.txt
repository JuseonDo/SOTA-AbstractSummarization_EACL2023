 Nothing too big and nothing too small.;
, It can help you remember everything you need and want to carry around with you.
 Who knows when your monthly period will come

, You could put mascara, blush, pressed powder, etc. Anything you'd like to touch-up during the school day.
 That way you can freshen up after gym .
 Sometimes you lose the backs of your earrings. And then you have to take your earrings out. Just take a small sandwich bag, and put around 5 extra backs in the bag.
 But check in with the school nurse or principal to see if it's OK to carry around with you.
 The school isn't that sanitary. So it's good to sanitize your hands a couple times throughout the day.
