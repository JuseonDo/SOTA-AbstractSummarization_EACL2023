 Look for the phrases “Dry Clean Only” or “Machine Wash.” Most tags specify cold water and a delicate cycle for machine washable fabrics. Take dry-clean-only fabrics to the dry cleaner for best results., Use this step if you can't afford or don't have the time for the dry cleaner. Laundry bags protect delicate fabrics from the agitation of the wash cycle. You can buy them in most big box stores. Use separate bags for the pillow and the blanket. Seal each bag before placing it in the washing machine., Place the materials in the washing machine. Set the machine to the delicate cycle. Avoid using detergent unless the washing instructions call for it. Add about a capful of fabric softener to the wash., Because pillows contain fabric fill, it's important to take extra steps to remove excess water after the spin cycle completes. Otherwise, you'll risk mold growth. Shaking and punching will also loosen any areas of fill that clumped together during the wash cycle. Do this until you don't feel any clumps inside the pillow., On a hot, sunny day, hang the pillow and blanket on a clothesline in direct sunlight. If it's raining or cold outside, dry the materials near a heating source, such as a heating vent. Avoid laying them directly on objects like space heaters or radiators, as this is a fire hazard., Take precautions if you choose this step. Place the pillow and blanket in separate drying bags, which you can find in most big box stores. If you don't have drying bags, wrap each item in a separate towel. Set the dryer for the most delicate setting that doesn't use heat. Check the pillow and blanket every 30 minutes. Remove them when they're completely dry.
