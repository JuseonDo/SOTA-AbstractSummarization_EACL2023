If you don't have a microwave oven, place in a double boiler for melting over the stove top.
 Microwave on high for 30 seconds, at 10 second intervals. Check each time to see how much it has melted. When fully melted, remove from the microwave oven.
 Put a few drops of each into the melted solution and stir to combine.
,, The soap will form in the mold shape as it cools.
 Spritz with rubbing alcohol to prevent the formation of surface bubbles. Set aside to cool for 3 to 5 minutes.

 Spray with rubbing alcohol. Set aside to cool for 30 seconds.
 Once again, spray with rubbing alcohol.
