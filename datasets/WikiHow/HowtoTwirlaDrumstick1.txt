 If you're unsure what the French Grip looks like:









Thumb on top of stick, running parallel
Weight of stick rests on your second knuckle of the middle and index finger.
Wrist and fingers are firm but relaxed.;
, This is the momentum that carries through the entire spin. Try to keep these motions calm and relaxed, just moving your fingers and not your whole hand.









This is often the hardest thing to start, and you may want to dedicate some time just to this "mini-spin" before moving on., The stick should now be between your index and middle finger, with the tip of the stick facing downwards.









This sort of "push, roll, switch fingers" motion will be used throughout the spin.
 Keep the pattern alive, making these half spins as you move down your hand. As you get faster, these will chain together for the dazzling pros spins you're looking for.
 The tip should be facing you again. By now, the stick may be cheating forward, trying to slip out the tips of your fingers, slightly angling your hand up as you practice, letting gravity help a bit, may make things easier.
 Simply reverse the earlier motion, alternating fingers as you rotate the string. When it gets to passing the stick to the thumb again, instead, bring your middle finger under, so that your little and middle fingers are under the stick facing you, and your third finger is on top. Then let go of your little finger and bring it around with your index finger again. You're ready to repeat!








, This kicks you off on the spin, keeping it moving over and over. Keep practicing this up and down, getting used to chaining them together smoothly.
