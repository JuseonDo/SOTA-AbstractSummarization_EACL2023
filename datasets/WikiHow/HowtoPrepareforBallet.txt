 They come in leather, canvas, or satin with elastic straps to secure them. These shoes can be either full-soled or split-soled, depending on your level.;
, Tights are usually in a salmon color, and you may buy either footed or Adaptatoe tights (tights with feet that can be pulled off). Leotards come in all shapes and sizes -- see if your class has a required color.
 If you have short hair, wear a headband or clips.
 It may not be needed, but these belts help to see when your hips move. In ballet, your hips should always be level and down while doing certain steps.
