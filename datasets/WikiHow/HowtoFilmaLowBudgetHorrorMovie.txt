 Once you get an idea for the script, take a full day to write it. No interruptions. Just you, the computer script writing program and comfy clothes.;
, Begin writing.
 When you are done with the first draft, let a couple of HONEST friends read it and tell you how it is and what needs improvement.
 If your friends say it needs improvement, write a second draft. Nothing wrong? Skip to step 6.
 If you still need improvement keep repeating until it is good.
 Your friends might not ALWAYS be the best choice.
 Create a shooting schedule. Make time to do at least 50 takes of one scene. It might sound ridiculous but if you cast your friends, they won't know their lines when it comes to filming some scenes.
,, You can maybe have an "End of Shooting" party.
 Make the film scary and cool. This includes, screeching music, fake blood (this can be edited in or it can be filmed. See if you are filming it in), and special effects.
