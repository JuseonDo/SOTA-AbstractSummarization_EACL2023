@article
;
,, You will see the groups that you're in.
, Make the name nice and don't make it the 3 or 4 letter initials. For example, don't call it RAT, call it Roblox Assault Team.
 Make it lure the other players in. Make it describe what you do in the group and make a motto. For war groups, put the motto in a different language. For other groups like an airline or fan club, just leave it English.
 Choose something that really looks nice or is colourful or even tells people about the group.
 Maybe you want a private group for your friends.
 Note, this will take 100 Robux from you.
