  Come up with a clear plan in your head for what order you want to address things in.  If you have a certain reason for calling, decide the best way to explain it.;
,  It's best to use their contact in the phone, because that way you're more likely not to get the number wrong.
  Even though you haven't met them, you probably have an image in your mind of them, and when they answer it will be easier to talk if you can picture them talking.
  Once they have, take a deep breath and say hi back.  Even if you want the conversation to be quick, don't be rude.
  Ex. "Hi, I'm Sara, your friend Hannah's niece."  Give them a chance to think about this and acknowledge that they know you.
  Instead of saying, "We're having a party," say, "Hannah's having a party at her house tomorrow at 7, and she's wondering if you could come?"

,  You may start to be uncomfortable by their silence, but they could be trying to remember Hannah or deciding how to answer a stranger without sounding weird.
  If you don't, ask them to explain.
  You may want to say something like, "Mom told me you had a clam," but they might not know how to answer you, and they'll probably start wondering how much more you know about them.
  Be proud of yourself for calling a stranger!
