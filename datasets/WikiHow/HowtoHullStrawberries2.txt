@summary
find a sturdy plastic drinking straw.

thread the end of the straw through the bottom point of the strawberry.

pull the straw all the way through the other end.

 If the straw has a bend to it, use the opposite end that is straight.
 Push it vertically until it comes out the calyx at the top. The riper the strawberry, the less force you will need to use.
 Grab the hull and discard it.
