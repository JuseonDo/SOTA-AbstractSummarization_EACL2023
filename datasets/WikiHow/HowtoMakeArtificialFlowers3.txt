 Tulle, silk, and other light, airy fabrics are perfect for making fabric flowers. Here's what you'll need:









A piece of fabric 4 inches wide and 20 inches long
A needle and thread
An iron

,,, The seams on either end should now be on the inside.
 Don't iron the middle of the fabric or the flower will end up with an unsightly crease.
 Thread the needle and knot one end. Baste along the long edge of the fabric where it folds. Keep stitching until you reach the other end.
,, Use the end of the thread to sew the gathered ends together to keep the rose in shape.
