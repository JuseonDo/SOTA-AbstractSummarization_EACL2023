 It is tough to get a job as an investment banker if you are not in school, but you can do it.
 If you are coming from an entirely different background, a nighttime or part-time MBA might be helpful. Normally, banks don't like part-time MBAs, but you can use it to tell your story about how committed you are to this career change.
 That may sound funny, but investment banks like hiring people with internships from school, and it can work for a mid career person as well.
 Call up investment bankers - friends of friends? - and ask them to lunch and get their advice.
