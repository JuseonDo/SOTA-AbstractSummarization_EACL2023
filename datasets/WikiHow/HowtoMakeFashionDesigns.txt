 It makes no sense to do something you don't have a real passion for.;
, Whether a rose, a car, or modern living, look around you for inspiration.
 If you want to, draw a skirt, draw it in the way you like it. It could have polka dots, lines or could just be plain.
, These magazines will give you a lot of inspiration. Magazines such as Vogue are great places to find out more about couture and high street fashion.
 It is always great to practice this way.
 Search for online designing contests. If you win, they will discover you.
 Believe in yourself!

, Draw your everyday clothes and give it a twist. Probably you could change your scarf or add a skirt instead of those skinny jeans. You could find out a lot about your style this way.
