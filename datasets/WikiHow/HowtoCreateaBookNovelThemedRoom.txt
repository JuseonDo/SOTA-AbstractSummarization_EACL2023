@summary
try typing in the phrase "teen room themes" on google if you can't think of any ideas.

 Don't just pick up something interesting and base the room off the cover.;
, If you wish, possibly find posters of them or print out pictures and frame them.
 Paint the room green if it's based outside, for example. If you can't paint your room, buy posters and pictures.E.g to make a room like Ron Weasley's from Harry Potter, put up quidditch pictures everywhere, have orange bedding and put 'magic books' all over the room.
 If the character has a desk, buy one! Or renovate yours. If they have a pink lamp, buy a pink lamp.
,, If you want to go really far, put a yellow brick road on your carpet leading to your bed. Then have a sign saying 'wizard' by the bed.
 Try putting glow in the dark stars on your ceiling. Find newspaper cuttings in your bedroom with alien stories on them, then stick them on your ceiling. Or make everything look like an alien landscape or as if your inside a UFO craft.
, Other detective stuff (e.g disguise, newspapers and tech) strewn everywhere will also look good. Put huge fingerprints on your wall using any way you can think of.
 You can paint hearts everywhere and write stuff like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' around the place.
 You could also hang posters from manga books and maybe have a manga figuring or statue displayed.
