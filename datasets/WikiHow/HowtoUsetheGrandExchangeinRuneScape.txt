 To find it, go to Varrock's West Bank, walk north through the bank, and follow the dirt path. You'll see two statues on each side of the opening. Alternatively, you can walk north through the palace courtyard, and follow the side of the castle north until you find the opening to the Grand Exchange on the west.;
, Bursen can be found just as you're walking up the stairs. He is the founder of the Grand Exchange and will give you a longer, more interesting tutorial, while the tutor will be more concise.You will need to be tutored in order to use the Grand Exchange or get tips from any skill helpers on the latest prices. Accept the tutoring and you'll watch a "movie" to show you how to use it. You can find him on the minimap by the question mark symbol.
 Each expert has a specialty and can be helpful to you in keeping up with price fluctuations.Hofuthand (the dwarf) - weapons and armor






Bob Barter - herbs






Relobo Blinyo - logs






Farid Morrisane - ores

, You'll see a screen with six boxes for buying and selling (two if you are a free player). Click on a box and you'll see new two boxes, each for the option of buying or selling an item.
 It will appear in the "Sell Box". Determine the quantity of that specific item to sell. For example, if you have 3 rune axes but only want to sell 2 of them, then your quantity would be 2. You can go the minimum, market, or maximum price for that item. Submit the item and wait for someone to bid and buy it.
 Once you click on an item from the search results, it will give you the information (price cost per, etc).
