 You'll either need to scavenge when the dropbear falls off and dies, or attack the dropbear with a suitable weapon.
 Alternatively you can kill a donkey but it's nicer to leave doing that as a last resort because they're benign creatures in the game.
 Your character will run to grab it. The leather goes into your inventory.
