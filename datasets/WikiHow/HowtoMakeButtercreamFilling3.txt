 After you have made the buttercream, consider adding in one of the flavors in this section.You can use the vanilla extract, or omit it completely.
 Dissolve 3 tablespoons of instant coffee in 2 tablespoons of hot water. Let the coffee cool, then beat it to the buttercream until everything is smooth. If the texture is too thin, mix in a few extra tablespoons of confectioners/icing sugar.
 Add up to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the buttercream. For more zest, add 2 tablespoons of grated lemon peel. Mix everything together until smooth. If needed, add in a few tablespoons of confectioners/icing sugar to even out the texture.
 Add up to 3 tablespoons of orange juice or Grand Marnier to the buttercream. For more texture, add 2 tablespoons of grated orange peel. Beat everything together until the buttercream is smooth again. If the texture is too thin, add in a few tablespoons of confectioners/icing sugar.
 Add 1 to 3 tablespoons of raspberry or strawberry jam into the buttercream. Beat everything together until it is smooth and there are no streaks or swirls. If the texture is too thin, mix in a few tablespoons of confectioners/icing sugar.
