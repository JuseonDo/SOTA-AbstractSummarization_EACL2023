 Make sure you sprinkle the plant itself to remove dirt and bugs from the plant.;
, If you want to dry the seeds, you will want to cut all of the flower buds in addition to the ferns.
 Use sharp kitchen shears.
 Spin them in a salad spinner, and then pat them dry with paper towels. Give them 3 minutes to air dry while spread out on a kitchen towel.
 Tie them together at the base using a rubber band. Make sure you have rid the plants of excess water, or they can mold instead of drying.
 Cut several large slits in the bottom sides of the bags so air can flow through.


If you plan to hang the dill inside, you can avoid using paper bags. If it is outside, it is a good way to shelter it from the elements and avoid losing dill that dries and falls., Ensure each dill plant is upside down. The gathered dill should be away from the side of the bag to encourage airflow.
 Leave them to dry for 2 weeks.
 Separate the dried flowers and dried ferns by hand.
 Crumble the ferns into another tin. Keep them in a dark, dry place.
