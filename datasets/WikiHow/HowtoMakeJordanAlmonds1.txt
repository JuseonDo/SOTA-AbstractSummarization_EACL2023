, Stir until the sugar dissolves completely. Once dissolved, stop stirring., Use a small pastry brush dampened with water and brush down the edges of the pan., Then add either the glucose or the cream of tartar. Stir immediately., Test for readiness in one of the two following ways:

Either take a teaspoonful and drop the syrup onto a saucer. If it forms a soft ball, it's ready. If not, keep boiling and test again shortly.
Place a candy thermometer into the syrup. If it registers 240ºF/115ºC, it's ready.
 Let stand until the air bubbles stop forming.,

Ensure that the depth of the syrup is no greater than 1 1/2 inches/3.8cm.
 It will need to be cool enough to handle.
