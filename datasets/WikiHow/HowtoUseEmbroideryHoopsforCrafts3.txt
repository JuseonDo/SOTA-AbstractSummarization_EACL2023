@summary
use the embroidery hoop for your loom.

@summary
cut an old t-shirt into one-inch-wide loops.

@summary
stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, spacing them evenly.

@summary
attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself.

@summary
connect another weft or two using the same method - looping them through the previous weft and again through themselves.

@summary
,

@summary
begin by weaving the weft over and under, forming a tight spiral.

@summary
begin treating each warp as 2 separate ones, dividing each individual loop.

@summary
continue weaving and adding warps.

@summary
when the rug is the desired size, cut you last weft loop.

@summary
cut the warps one at a time.

 If you would like a full-size rug, a hula-hoop works the best.
  These will be your warps and wefts.
  (These are the warps)  Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it.  You will probably only use 4 if you are making a mini rug. A large rug can take as many as 12. It is best if the warps are the same color.
  Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material.  Don't fret if you do - it happens.
,  Keep the material snug, but not tight.  Push together two loops at the top and treat them as one warp.  This creates an odd number of warps.  As you go around, be sure to go under the warp that you went over last time.  If using the embroidery hoop, continue this method until your spiral is about 3" across.  With a hula hoop, continue until 8" across.
  Maintain your odd number of warps by keeping one warp together.
 Be careful not to pull the weave any tighter as you go, or you'll end up with a basket, rather than a rug; just stay consistent.
  Wrap it around a nearby warp and tie it firmly.  Tuck the ends in.
  Tie the ends in pairs.  Trim to make a fringe or tuck into the rug.
