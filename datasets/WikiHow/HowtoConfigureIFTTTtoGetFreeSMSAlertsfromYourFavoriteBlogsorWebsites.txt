Many blogs and websites use WordPress CMS, so in order to find the feed, just add "/feed" or "/feeds" to the tail of the URL to retrieve the posts from the home page.

Example: If the home page URL is http://www.crawlerguys.com then the feed will be at http://www.crawlerguys.com/feed. This will fetch the entire updates from the blog.


If you want to receive SMS updates only from a particular category from your favorite blog or website, then select that category and just add "/feed" to the tail of that URL.

Example: http://www.telecomclue.com/category/os/android/ is a sub category in telecomclue.com. To get the SMS alerts from android category, put "http://www.telecomclue.com/category/os/android/feed" in the Feed URL. When the android category is updated, you will receive an SMS talking about the new post in that category.


Donâ€™t worry if a blog is with Blogger, IFTTT also supports Blogger channel.
 Select SMS.
 Enter your phone number and click Send Pin.
 The pop up window will close now. Click on "Continue to the next step."

, By default you can receive Feed Title, Entry Title and Entry URL of a particular post.


If you want to receive the post content then just click "+" and select EntryContent from the drop down menu. Then select Add ingredient.
 You are now all set to receive your favorite blog or website updates as SMS.
