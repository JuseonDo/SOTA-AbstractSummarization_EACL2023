 You can make them all one color, or different colors. You can even use old Christmas cards. One of these circles will be your template., Take one circle, and fold it in half both ways to make an X. Fold three edges towards the middle, each one overlapping the previous one, to make a triangle. Unfold your triangle, and cut off the flaps. Discard the cut-off flaps, and save the triangle., Take your triangle, and set it down in the middle of your first circle, aligning the points with the edges. Fold the edges of the circle over the triangle, make a crease, then pull the triangle out. Do this for all 20 circles, and do not cut the flaps off.Once you have folded all 20 circles, you can discard the triangle.
 Take your first two pieces, and orient them so one is pointing up and the other is pointing down. Glue the flaps together. Glue the remaining 8 pieces in a similar manner to form a rope.If you don't have a hot glue gun, you can use regular glue instead, but you will need to use paper clips to hold the pieces together while they dry.
 Set the ring aside when you are done. This is the middle segment of your ornament.
 Arrange 5 pieces together to form a circle; make sure that they are all pointing upwards. Glue the flaps together, then set the top segment aside. Repeat this step one more time to make the bottom segment.
 Choose a ribbon that matches the colors of your ornament. Make sure that the loop is big enough to fit over a branch on your Christmas tree., Make sure that you are pushing the needle from the inside of the segment. Pull the yarn needle off the loop, and gently tug the loop until the knot is snug against the inside.
 Make sure that you align the flaps. Once the glue dries, your ornament is complete!
