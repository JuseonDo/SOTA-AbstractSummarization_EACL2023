 You want to cut them in half so that they will be easier to blend/process. It's probably a good idea to take off the peel before freezing. It would be more difficult to get off, otherwise.;
,, The images in this article will be using a stick blender.
, If you are using a stick blender, you will want to add a few at a time. If a food processor or blender, you can add them all at once.
 If the bananas were only partially frozen, then you probably won't need to add anything else, like coconut or almond milk. Then your smoothie will be fruit only.
 If you want it to be more like ice cream, make sure your bananas are completely frozen and after everything is blended together, put in the freezer for a short time.
 If you want to add to it, or use other fruits, the result will be the same...absolutely tasty and healthy.
