 No one will even know you exist if you don't play often enough. Be sure to log on at least twice a week.
 If no one likes you, forget being cool!;
, Show confidence and be bold. And what's there to be shy about? You aren't talking to anybody face to face and they can't see you, so do your best to be funny and fun!

, Do this both from the start and during the time you're playing the game. Add members and non-members, try for about a minimum of 100 of each.


Give stickers to others.
 Shout this stuff out Downtown (this is the best place to do so) and Uptown. As an added bonus, you'll get an extra buddy if you add the winner.
 It doesn't matter who adds whom first. Just don't miss the chance. If you see them online again in a world, just go. It's not called stalking, it's called, "I want to talk to/meet my fun friend".
 If you go to as many events as you can, you might get some things that other nons, who missed the event, won't have.
 You can trade stickers!

, You could even gain a level!

, These include: Bullseye, Staries, Candy Swap, Bubble Bug. You can only use the Rare Sapphires but you still get rare items that other nons might not have.
 Do this by playing games, gaining medals and following the suggestions outlined above.
 If you watch a lot of videos and earn a lot of eCoins then you might get enough to buy something that normally only mems can get.
 This is really important! It may involve a bit of cash to buy e-coins. Make your Fantage character look good, not different. By different, this means funky costumes––they look a bit weird. Looking weird may get you attention but not look of approval. If your character looks good, you won't even have to strike a conversation. People will come to you all of the time.
