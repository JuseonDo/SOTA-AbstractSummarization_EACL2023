 Sure, they feel great, but they also strip your skin of essential moisture. Especially in the winter, limit your showers to 10 minutes and keep the water lukewarm.
 These areas are just as vulnerable to wrinkles, dryness and signs of aging as your face is. After cleansing these areas with a facial cream, rub in a facial moisturizer. You can also use a facial mask on these areas once per month.
 Instead, go with a soap that contains added fat, like Dove, Neutrogena or Oilatum. The added fat leaves a moisturizing layer on your skin after your shower is over.
 Then, cover your hands with thin cloth gloves, and put some socks on your feet to allow the moisture to hydrate your hands and feet.
 Loofahs get rid of dead skin cells and also prevent bumps from ingrown hairs. To make your skin even more smooth, you can sprinkle your loofah with some drops of a cleanser containing AHAs.
 Under your breasts, under your arms and on your inner thighs are good places. The powder prevents chafing, bacterial growth and itching.
