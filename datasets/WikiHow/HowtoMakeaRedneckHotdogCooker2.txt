 Whether you get them on sale or you go for the expensive dogs; make sure you find the kind of hotdogs you like best.
 Add bacon, cheese or any other topping right on the dog before you cook it. Use toothpicks to hold a piece of wrapped bacon in place or throw on a piece of cheese right before the hotdog is fully cooked.
 If you are using a garden rake, add one hotdog to each prong. Make sure the hotdog is fully pierced and you can see the other end of the rake (so that the hotdog doesn’t fall off the rake and into your fire).
 Make sure you have a decent flame or heat coming from your heat source. You should be able to cook the hotdogs fairly quickly if you have a strong flame/heat.
 Avoid placing the meat directly into the flame if you are cooking them over a campfire because it could cause the hot dogs to burn.
 Turn the rake or your cooking device over to ensure the meat browns evenly.
 Or use a hot pad, a towel or your t-shirt to remove the dogs and plate them.
