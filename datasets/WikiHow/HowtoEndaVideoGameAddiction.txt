 If you have a video game addiction, admit it. Do not try to rationalize it, deny it, ignore it, justify it, or compare yourself to others. Just try to work toward a solution.;
, Create a yearly budget with a reasonable limit. Also, try to refrain from impulse buying. Not only will this help cure the addiction, but it will save you money.
 Realize that the video games you are playing now aren't going to matter to you at all in five years, or possibly even one. Realize that nothing productive is achieved from playing video games and after five years, your video game collection will be meaningless. Your high scores will hold no prestige in five years.
 Don't try to complete video games 100%, since in most cases, that requires dozens of hours. Realize that while it may feel accomplishing inside to unlock everything, it produces no real tangible benefits and can be done without.
 For example, go from 20 hours, to 18 hours, to 16, and lower.
 Do not play video games to reward yourself; instead, treat yourself to some ice cream or something fun. You can even enlist a friend or family member.
 before you play games. Video games should also be used only to reward good behavior - not bad behavior.
, Most addictions work like a vicious cycle. Indulgence in vices, results in problems which can be temporary alleviated by indulging in vices.
