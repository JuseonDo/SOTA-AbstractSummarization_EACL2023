 Favoring a leg can develop structures differently, resulting in what appears to be uneven legs.;
, Rock your hips from side to side gently for about a minute. This should help relax your hips, back and legs.
 Their thumbs can be near the top shin, and their other fingers should grasp right above your heel.
 They should lift and pull toward themselves gently for about 15 seconds. Repeat once.
 If they are about even, it is likely the legs are a similar length. Move on to other tests in the next section.



Start with a pelvic exercise. Lie on your back and bend your knees one at a time. Lift your feet up and wrap your arms between your thighs and calves. Lift your knees toward you by tucking your pelvis and release. Repeat 15 times.Move to your hips. Lay on your side with a chair just over your feet. Bring one foot up to rest on the chair. Lift your other leg carefully up to meet the bottom of the chair. Be sure to hold a solid position with the rest of your body by engaging the abs. Repeat 20 times. Then, switch sides.Work on your knees. Sit in a chair with your knees and legs bent at a 90-degree angle. Lift one leg until it is straight and hold for five seconds. Lower it slowly. Repeat 10 times and then move to the next leg.Move to your soleus muscles. Sit in a similar way in your chair. Place a weight on top of each thigh. Lift your heel until you are on your toes, keeping your foot from rocking left or right. Slowly lower it to the ground. Repeat 10 times and then switch legs., Then, do traction and test for leg symmetry. Your leg and back muscles may be looser and less likely to look off balance.,
