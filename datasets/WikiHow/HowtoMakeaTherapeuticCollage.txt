 Creativity is for everyone and comes in many forms. We can write a story, paint a picture or stitch and frame a canvas. Learning who we are now and what our aims and goals were when we were younger, can help us be happier and more content adults. Somehow, many of us feel we got lost along the way and gave up our identities and our dreams to please others.
 Look through various magazines and cut out pictures. Look for pictures that reveal who you are or who you think you are and what you would like to be.,, Take your time, part of the therapy is looking, searching, and trying to find the person you seemed to have lost in the process of growing up and just where you would like to go in the future. Dream BIG, but be realistic., This is your life you are pasting, so keep that in mind when you organize the pictures. Realize that by creating a collage of what you had wanted to be, you might find that you have been that person after all, and that the imaginary person you are now making up is much like you are now. Once that realization sets in, , the unrest and turmoil within you, the anger you might feel at yourself for not being what you had wanted to be, might cease, and you can be a happier and more content person.,
