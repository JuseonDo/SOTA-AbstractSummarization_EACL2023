 If you can't play any instrument, then how are you going to rock out?;
, Pick some of your more loyal friends to be in your band, and if you don't fill in all the slots (lead guitar, bass guitar, singer, drummer keyboard and rhythm guitars are opt), pick someone you know. Just make sure that they are good at their instrument.
 The logo will be important for merchandising, assuming you get to that point.
 If you can take a white shirt and put your band name and logo on it, that'd be sweet.
 This can be at school, a cafe, or anywhere you think teenagers hang out.
 After playing a few gigs, you should have a relatively large fan base; make sure you're nice to all of them, and don't let it get to your head.
 You're technically not a rockstar, despite your ego, until thousands of people enjoy your songs.
