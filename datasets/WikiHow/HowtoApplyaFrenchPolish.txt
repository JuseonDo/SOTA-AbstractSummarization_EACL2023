@summary
begin with a clean, perfectly smooth wood surface and a clean, dust-free, warm room.

@summary
mix 3 ounces of shellac flakes with 1 pint of denatured alcohol.

@summary
soak a wad of gauze in shellac, then place it inside a cotton cloth (a piece of an old bed sheet or white tee-shirt works well).

@summary
add a few drops of olive oil to the pad.

@summary
apply the shellac to the wood surface in a gliding or sweeping motion, working one small area at a time, perhaps 2 square feet.

@summary
build a fresh pad, then add a few drops shellac and several drops of alcohol to the cloth.

@summary
allow the work to sit for a couple of hours so any oil can come to the surface.

@summary
let the work sit for several hours so it can dry completely, then repeat the boding, stiffing and spiriting sessions.

@summary
polish the surface with rottenstone and olive oil.

@summary
finish with a thin coat of furniture wax to help protect your french polish from damage.

 Any imperfections in the wood or dust that settles onto the surface while you're working will show up in the polish. A cold room will cause the polish to be cloudy.;
, Keep the mixture in a tightly sealed container, pouring small amounts into a shallow bowl as you work. Although you can buy shellac already mixed, the fresher it is, the better the results will be. Use gloves when working with shellac.
 Tie up the ends of the cloth with string to make a sort of handle. Squeeze the pad to force most of the shellac out.
 You may want to use an eyedropper to keep from adding too much. The purpose of the oil is to keep the pad from drying out and sticking as you apply shellac. If the pad does start to stick, add another couple of drops of oil.
 Gradually change to circular, then figure-8 motions. Each sweep will leave a thin layer of shellac, and your goal is to leave about 100 of these layers in one boding session.


The shellac will dry quickly, so using an improper motion will leave an imprint of the pad on the surface.
 Begin your stiffing session by sweeping the pad in even strokes from one side to the other to smooth out any unevenness in the shellac. Take care not to remove any shellac.
 Then repeat the stiffing session to remove the oil. This is a separate step called spiriting.
 You will do this several times to build up a thick shellac surface on the wood.
 Place the rottenstone in a salt shaker and sprinkle it on the surface, then apply a few drops of olive oil to a fresh pad and rub the entire surface until you're satisfied with its appearance.
