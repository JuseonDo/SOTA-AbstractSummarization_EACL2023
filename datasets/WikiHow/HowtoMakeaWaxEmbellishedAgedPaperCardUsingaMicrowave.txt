,, This will ensure that it has lots of crevices, looking much more like old paper.
 You will only need one cup of tea, so heat some water in the microwave (make sure it is a microwavable cup), then put a teabag in it and let the water absorb a little bit.


Be sure that the color is not too light; while it may seem too dark for the impression of aged paper, but appearances deceive.
 Soak the teabag and squeeze it over the paper; rub gently.


Don't be afraid to make little tears here and there, you'll have to do that to make it look old anyway.
If you're using coffee, use a paintbrush and brush gently.
If you want it to dry faster use a hairdryer.
 To flatten it, put a big heavy object on it. When it is dry, fold it like a hotdog, equally on both sides.
 Chip a few chunks of wax off a red candle; don't try this on a burning one though!

, When most of it is melted, pour it into a small measuring cup.
, Don't take it off if there is resistance when you try to take it off.
 This is the finished product.
