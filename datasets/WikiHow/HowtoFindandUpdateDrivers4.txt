 The Device Manager utility lets you view all of your installed hardware. You can use it to scan for driver updates.
,, You'll see a list of hardware categories. Expanding each one will display all of the different hardware components installed in your computer.


If a piece of hardware is not installed correctly, you'll see it listed in the Other devices section as an Unknown device. Windows will not be able to find the driver for you, so you'll need to download the driver from the manufacturer.
,, Windows will scan for any drivers available for download.
 If a driver update has been found by Windows, click Install and follow the prompts to install it.
