If you want to hide your YouTube channel so that the public can no longer access it, you can do so from your Google Account settings page. This is less permanent than deleting the channel entirely, but some data may be lost.
 This can be found at the bottom of the page.
,, Your channel name, videos, and subscribers will be made private. Comments made before November 2013 will be permanently deleted.
 After checking each of the boxes to confirm that you understand what will happen to your data, click the "Hide my channel" button to make your channel private.
