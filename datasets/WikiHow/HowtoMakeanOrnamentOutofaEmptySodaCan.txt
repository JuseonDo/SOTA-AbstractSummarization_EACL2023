 Shake out the excess water.;
, Be very careful, as both your knife/scissors and the sharp edges of the can can be dangerous. Make the cut a bit under the metal top. Even it out the cut with scissors.
 Mark off the bottom of the can with a line, a bit above the bottom metal part. It should loop all around the can, until you complete the circle.
 Use scissors to make multiple diagonal cuts down to the line you drew.
 It should look like a full sun now.
 Use it to roll every strip to a different amount. The strips will curl.
 Cut it out so it fits in the circular "sun" center of your ornament, and tape the photo into that space.
