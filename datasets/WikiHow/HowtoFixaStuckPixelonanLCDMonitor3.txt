, If you can, heat water on the stove until it's just beginning to show air bubbles at the bottom of the container. Put the washcloth in a colander, and dump the hot water over the washcloth.
 You don't want to burn your fingers in the next steps.
 Make sure the seal is completely closed.
 Hold the plastic bag up to the screen such that the area you're using doesn't have a seam on it, because the seam may break open, and hot water may damage your computer. As much as you can, try to only focus the heat on the stuck pixel.
 Move the bag around the pixel a bit in a massage-like motion. The heat generated will cause the liquid crystal to flow more easily into the areas that were not formerly filled.
