 If you have any doubts about safety, have your residence inspected by a qualified building inspector or structural engineer before entering.
 If it looks like the building may collapse, do not enter the house, or if you have entered, leave immediately.
 Be aware of loose boards and slippery floors. Use a battery-powered flashlight to inspect a damaged home. The flashlight should be turned on outside before entering—the battery may produce a spark that could ignite leaking gas, if present.
 If you notice these, open a window and leave immediately. Turn off the main gas valve from the outside, if you can. Call the gas company from a neighbor’s residence. If you shut off the gas supply at the main valve, you will need a professional to turn it back on. Do not smoke or use oil, gas lanterns, candles, or torches for lighting inside a damaged home until you are sure there is no leaking gas or other flammable materials present.
 If possible, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If the situation is unsafe, leave the building and call for help. Do not turn on the lights until you are sure they’re safe to use. You may want to have an electrician inspect your wiring.
 Then, unplug appliances and let them dry out. Have appliances checked by a professional before using them again. Also, have the electrical system checked by an electrician before turning the power back on.
 Check with local authorities before using any water; the water could be contaminated. Pump out wells and have the water tested by authorities before drinking. Do not flush toilets until you know that sewage lines are intact.
, The walls may collapse and the floor may buckle if the basement is pumped out while the surrounding ground is still waterlogged.
 Disinfect items that may have been contaminated by raw sewage, bacteria, or chemicals. Also clean salvageable items.
 Take pictures of damages. Keep good records of repair and cleaning costs.
