go to forge and start a session on sandtrap.

@summary
go to the front of the elephant and stack all of the plasma batteries in the front, basically right next to the fusion coils.

@summary
go to the back of the elephant again and shoot at only one of the fusion coils, then stand back and watch the most amazing form of the flying elephant.

@summary
another way is to put as much junk as you can pile on and try to drive it.

@summary
one of the more simple ways to fly the elephant is to simply take a scorpion, warthog, or anything else with a good size and hold on to it as you make it get stuck in a corner or where the driver is and fly away, and the elephant should follow you wherever you go.

 The first thing you want to do is delete all the fusion coils and plasma batteries that are on the map. Then, drive one of the elephants out to a flat open area. Next, stack every single fusion coil in the middle of the bottom floor, but spread them all over the middle or else it won't work, and don't forget to set the respawn time to 10 seconds and the maximum/minimum time to the highest number.;
, Set the times for respawn just like the fusion coils.
 It will do flips and rise up really high, then fall down and rise up again, and it usually makes its way around the map, unless you do it a certain way.
 What typically happens is called "LAG" which is when you have to much stuff together and causes the elephant to "LAG" into the ground. After awhile the game will get angry or whatever and make your elephant barrel roll, but in the more severe cases, the lag can send your elephant across the entire map. This is considered to be a relative to the "Bump", which is the annoying "bump" that items do when you try to form objects with turret cases and stuff like that, and it usually screws everything up and makes it all fall down.
