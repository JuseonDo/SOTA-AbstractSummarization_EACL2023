, Usually the rainbow consists of ROYGBIV––red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. This amount of colours might be too much for you to deal with, so the first four colors will be sufficient to give a sense of the rainbow, you can skip blue since your nails are blue and roll indigo and violet into purple. It's your choice!

, This is for the color of the sky. Let dry before proceeding.
 Let dry.
Repeat with the next color, aligning the arc closely to the first one. Let dry.
Continue with the remaining arcs until complete. Allow drying time between each one, as this can cause smudging if still wet.
 Move to the next nail. If planning on doing each nail, set aside a good hour or so to complete. It can help to have a friend do your nails, then swap, as this makes it easier to draw the arc and it's less tedious since you can both talk at the same time.
