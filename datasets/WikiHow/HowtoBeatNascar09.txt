 You can't play the game without these too.;
, It will work as you can save your progress throughout the game.
 Immediately skip to driver info and career mode.
 This sponsor and team should be the lowest on the list of sponsors that you can access because you gain the most reputation and performance points.
 This might damage your long-term success, but it will help you gain the reputation you need.
 However, with these settings, you should qualify at around 30th, but you must win every single race in order to gain reputation quickly.
 Seriously. If you win a race by leading a lap, you will get 249 reputation points per race (an added 50 for the Las Vegas race). If you do this, you should be able to sign with a Sprint Cup Series team in just 4 Nationwide Series races.
, By the time you don't gain any more reputation, you should have 1 championship and around 50 wins if you do this properly. So, now you can start increasing the difficulty levels, and start from ones that are worth the least, and then start adding on the difficulty.
