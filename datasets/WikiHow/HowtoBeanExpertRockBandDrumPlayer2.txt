@summary
move onto medium mode, and play one song from each difficulty type (solid songs, skilled songs, blistering songs), starting from the easiest to the blistering ones.

@summary
understand the rhythms you play, and the sound the drumsticks make when they hit the pads should sound logical to you.

@summary
repeat the process on hard mode, but do two songs of each difficulty type until you score 90 percent or more.

 Don't worry about the impossible songs, they are only a challenge so you won't get bored, but are actually pretty impossible.
 When you're ready, move on to hard mode.
 You will soon want to move on to expert, but you shouldn't do this until you feel your hands respond without thinking. This normally happens around the 3rd day you've been playing on hard mode. If it doesn't, just keep practicing. Remember that there are some people that have the rhythm already in their heads, and some that need rhythm to be introduced little by little.
