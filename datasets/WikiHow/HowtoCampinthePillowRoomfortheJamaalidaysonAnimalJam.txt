You can buy a pirate sword and something cozy like an old hood works great. Wear a backpack for "Your bags";
,,,


Lie on the pillows or in a cozy corner and say *sets up tent*

, say *puts bags in* take off your backpack

, go outside and find a tree and say *takes branches* and light them with rocks, sticks, or even matches. say *lights fire*

, Pretend to eat food and offer it to someone else.
 If you have free chat then you can sing all sorts of songs. You can sing "She's coming 'round the mountain" or "Kumbaya"

, Wear a blanket and lie down in your tent. Make the zzz emoticon until you decide its morning.
 Pack up! Pack your tent, weapons, food, and clothing! Put on your backpack, say *picks up tent* and move on!


You learned how to camp in the pillow room! Nice job!
