 Add slightly warmed water and the sugar. Put aside to develop.
 Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
, If needed, add more flour to improve the consistency. Stir until a dough forms.
 Knead lightly.
 Let sit on the floured surface. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
 Cast iron skillets are ideal for this purpose.
 Add to the skillet and heat until you see it forming large bubbles or holes. Turn it over and cook the other side for another few minutes.
