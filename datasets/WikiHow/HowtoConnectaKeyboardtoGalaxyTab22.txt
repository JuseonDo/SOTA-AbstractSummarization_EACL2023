You can use any USB keyboard if you get a USB OTG host cable. This adapter lets you connect a standard-sized USB plug to your Samsung Galaxy Tab. OTG is only supported on higher-end Galaxy Tabs.
 As soon as you plug the keyboard in or set it in the dock, it should begin working immediately.
 You may need to manually select your keyboard.


Select "Language & input"
Ensure that your keyboard is checked in the list of input methods.
 There's a known error with some versions of the Samsung Galaxy Tab and the official dock. The quickest way to fix it is to follow this procedure:


Power down the Samsung Galaxy Tab completely by holding the Power button and then selecting Power Off.
Insert the powered-down Tab into the dock.
Power the Samsung Galaxy Tab back on. Check the "Language & inputs" menu to ensure that your dock is enabled.
Charge your dock. If it's still not working, give your dock some time to charge. It may not have enough power to work.
