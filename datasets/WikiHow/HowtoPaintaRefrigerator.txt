Brush on paint provides less mess, and is a more suitable choice if painting the refrigerator while indoors. However, brush strokes may show once the paint is dried unless additional steps are taken to smooth the appliance paint with a sponge brush while wet.
Spray on appliance paint works like a traditional can of spray paint and produces an even, smooth coat of paint. Spray on application takes less time, however you will need to cover nearby surfaces with protective plastic, or transport the refrigerator outdoors prior to painting.;
,, Allow the refrigerator to air-dry for at least an hour to be certain that all moisture is gone. Do not dry the refrigerator with a soft cloth or towel, as you may transfer lint onto its surface.
 A variety of rust treatment products are available at your local hardware store.
 Painters tape provided safe coverage and is easily removable from most surfaces.
 Check the manufacturer's label for specific instructions, but you may generally expect to:


Shake or stir the paint thoroughly to be certain of an absolute mix.
Apply light, even coats. Approximately 2-3 coats will be required to ensure an even finish.
Allow for 15 minutes of drying time between coats of paint.
Allow paint to dry for approximately 24 hours before returning refrigerator to its original place.
