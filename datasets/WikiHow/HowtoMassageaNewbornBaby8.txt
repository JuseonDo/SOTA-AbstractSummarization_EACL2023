 Back arching is usually a sign that your baby is being over-stimulated. If your baby appears to be distressed or not responding in a relaxed manner you should end the session and retry again later.
 One of the best times for your baby may be after her last feeding for the night. Massage can help stimulate digestion and promote a state of relaxation that will assist with a sounder sleep.
