 Any time you attack Demise, he will parry it with his sword. You can also wait for him to attack you if you don't want to risk losing health. When he prepares to strike, you shield bash or backflip. This give you an opportunity to attack.;
, Don't attack like a maniac or use a lot of attacks as Demise will fight back while you are open for them. Demise will fall to the ground after 4 consecutive hits. Simply swing rapidly until he gets back up.
