 Cut 13 three to four inch triangles out of the felt. Be careful to make them the same exact size.
 The top point of the triangles will be facing down.
 Then, sew through the top of the bunting, making sure to sew through the points where the triangles overlap.
 Loop the bunting around your neck. Pin it together where it meets.
 Draw eyeballs in the center with black permanent marker.


If you want to emulate Kermit the frog, search for an image on a search engine and draw the eyes in a similar manner.
 Use super glue to ensure that they stay on. Make sure the black pupils are facing the right way when the clips are horizontal.
