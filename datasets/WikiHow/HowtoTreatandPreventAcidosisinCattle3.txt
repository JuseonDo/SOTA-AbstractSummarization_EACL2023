the most obvious preventative measure is to not have cattle on grain in the first place.

@summary
feeding grain often cannot be avoided, though, so gradually increasing the grain ration over time is the best way to prevent acidosis while still feeding cattle grain.

always include roughage with the grain diet you are giving your cattle.

@summary
often nature-caused interruptions like storms, hot- or cold-spells, and extreme weather, or change in schedules such as being handled or hauled to a new farm or ranch can cause cattle to reduce their feed intake or stop eating all together until the danger has passed.

 This is because grain is not a natural diet for cattle, and often causes more issues and illnesses than grass or hay does. This is often one faultless preventative measure that a lot of producers can (and do) fall back on.
, This helps with ease of digestion in the rumen, and also prevents the microbes in the rumen from digesting this high-concentrate ration too fast.


Roughage should not be finely chopped, as this will often defeat the purpose of preventing acidosis. Coarsely-chopped (or not chopped at all!) roughage is best.
 Then they over-eat to compensate for the loss of diet they missed during this interruption. Often during extremely hot spells cattle won't eat during the day, then eat their hearts out at night when it's cooler.


Thus, try to keep feeding schedules as routine as possible and keep feeding to several times a day to keep cattle from getting hungry between meals.
