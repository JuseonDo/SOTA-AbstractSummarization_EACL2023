 Utilize historical data from past conferences to come up with an average number of attendees. This will provide some idea of the total number of rooms that the hotel must have available for the event.;
, Think in terms of the number of vendors or other organizations that may be asked to exhibit, and focus attention on hotels that offer a large enough area for this portion of the event. The space may be in the form of 1 or more conference areas that allow easy access to each of the exhibit booths. Also inquire about the availability of power and wireless hookups for each of the exhibits and displays.
 Many conferences require multiple conference or assembly rooms that provide space for small group and large group gatherings over the course of the conference. Make sure each space has access to audio-visual equipment for use in presentations.
 Ideally the hotel you choose can prepare a menu that is varied enough to manage the varied dietary requirements that your attendees will need.
, Try to obtain the lowest rates possible for the conference rooms and space so that registration and exhibition fees are equitable for the attendees while still covering the expenses for the entire event.
 A low price may be attractive but if the hotel has a reputation for lower quality in accommodations and guest services, it may be better to spend a little more and go with a hotel that has a higher rating.
