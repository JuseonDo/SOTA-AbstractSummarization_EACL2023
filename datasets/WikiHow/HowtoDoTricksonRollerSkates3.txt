 Spinning is more complicated than it sounds. You need balance, mastery of turning, and mastery of the one-foot turn (above)., If you spin too fast, someone might get hurt. Make sure that the area you are spinning in is not crowded., Maybe try weaving in and out of cones or poles. This constant turn helps your balance., You should never start spinning right after pushing off, you should start spinning in the middle of a glide. When you are ready to spin, start to turn like you would if you were turning a small corner., Make sure to do tight circles, so it almost looks like you are spinning on ice skates., You will start going forward, fast or slow, depending on how fast you spun. Don't get dizzy!
