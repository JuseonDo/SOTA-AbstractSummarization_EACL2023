 Make sure you have one or two bars of colored scented soap as well. Keep in mind that you will need to have a fragrance oil that will smell good with the soap.;
, Set a bowl underneath your grater so that it will catch the shavings. Make sure not to spill.
 The size and number of the pieces doesn't matter.
 Remember to leave enough soap for later!

, Fill the bottom part of the boiler halfway up with water.
 Then, turn your stove to high.
 As you're mixing, add as much colored soap and fragrance as you desire.


The olive oil will soften your skin.
 Beware of melting it for too long! Once you see that the soap is getting clumpy, turn the stove off.
 Firmly press it down.


A little bit of the colored soap that you added earlier should be located in the bottom of the mold. You should not have melted all the colored soap.
, This may take a few hours. Once it has hardened, gently pop it out of the mold.


If you're giving this away as a gift, place the soap in a box (a tin box is recommended) with a label announcing what it is inside the box. Wrap it nicely.
