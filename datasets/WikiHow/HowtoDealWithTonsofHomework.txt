 Also keep folders and notebooks separate for each subject. Usually your school will give you a daily planner to write down and organize your homework. If not keep a calendar either on your electronic device (most smartphones come equipped with this) or on a paper calendar that you can hang somewhere. Always be sure to write down any homework, tests, or upcoming events for school. If you do have a test that you know of a couple days before hand. Do not leave it to the last minute, you will have to end up doing homework and studying.;
, Only do what is needed. For example if your Spanish homework is only page one in the book, don't also do page two, three, and/or four! Only do extra if you have the time and you are sure this will be assigned to you on a day where you are crammed up with after school events. Another exception is extra credit, especially if you need it.
 Cross things off your list as you go.You can also cross it off your planner or calendar.
 If you study between homework pages, it may distract you.
 Do your hardest subjects first to get them over with.
 For example: French-ten minutes, science-ten minutes, math-forty minutes, history-twenty minutes, total of roughly 1 1/2 hours.Always set times, or you will end up with a pile of studying in a short amount of time.
 Take a walk, eat dinner, check your social networks. Just make sure its quick (no more than 15 minutes) If you are tight try not to get distracted, only do the things listed before on the weekends. Do not turn on the TV, or you'll never go back and finish your homework.
 This will lighten the burden when you get home.
, Try to do it as early as possible.
 The earlier you start your homework, the sooner you will finish!
