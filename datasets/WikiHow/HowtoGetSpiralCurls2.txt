 You can let it air-dry or use a blow drier. Your hair should be completely dry before you begin curling.









Avoid adding products at this point. Flat irons are most effective on hair that is clean and smooth.
 Make the part where you want it in the finished style.
 It can be 1- to 2-inches wide. Start from the front of your head or in the back, whichever is easiest for you.
 If you want your curls to start higher, place the iron closer to the roots.









You should be holding the flat iron vertically, with the tip pointing upwards.
Your flat iron needs to be thin (think 1-2 inches) with a rounded barrel. The heat from the iron heats up the barrel just enough to curl your hair.
 Make just one twist.
 Hold the twist you made in the previous step and gradually pass the rest of your hair through it.









You may need to experiment with how slowly you go here. Holding the flat iron longer at the top ensures a full curl, rather than just curls at the ends. The longer you hold, the more curl you'll get.
Don't open the iron at any point here: it should remain clamped shut.
 Work in small sections.
 Loosen the curls if you like, or keep them tighter.
 Add volume and definition by warming a small amount of product in your palms and working it through your curls with your fingertips.
