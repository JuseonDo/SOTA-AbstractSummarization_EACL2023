 The size should be matched to the meatball. See the image for the exact shape.


 


Lay each piece of cheese on the meatball surface. Place in the microwave for 9 seconds to melt it onto the meatball surface.;
, Cut a rectangle and gently scoop out a dip in the middle to create two little beak peaks each end of the rectangle. Place the beak on each penguin's cheese face.
 Cut tiny round eyes from nori. Place each eye on the penguin's cheese faces. Add a single black sesame seed to create an eyelash per eye. That's the penguin completed.
 At the base of the bento container, create a thin protein layer using the crushed meatballs., See image in the introduction for an example.,
Arrange the fish jun and kiwi slices around the edge of the other half of the container.
Carefully insert the cherry tomatoes, blackberries and pea pods.
 On top of it, gently add a small nori star.
 (You will need a fish shaped cutter for this if you're not adept at cutting freestyle.) Place into the arrangement.
 To make the scales, use one half of the end of a drinking straw to make the shape. Place into the arrangement.
 Alternatively, serve up to your fussy kids who will love this for a change!
