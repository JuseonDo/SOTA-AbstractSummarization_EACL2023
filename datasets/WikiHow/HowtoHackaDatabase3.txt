 Their tools are reputable and used by system administrators all over the world for security testing. Browse their “Exploitation” database (or find another trustworthy site) to find tools or text files that help you exploit security holes in databases.


Another site with exploits is www.exploit-db.com. Go to their website and click the Search link, then search for the type of database you want to hack (for example, “oracle”). Type the Captcha code in the provided square and search.
Be sure you research all exploits you plan to try so you know what to do in case of potential issues.
 Wardriving is technically legal. Doing something illegal from a network you find while wardriving is not.
 If you’re doing something you’re not supposed to be doing, it’s probably not a good idea to do it from your own network. Connect wirelessly to one of the open networks you found while wardriving and run the exploit you’ve researched and chosen.
