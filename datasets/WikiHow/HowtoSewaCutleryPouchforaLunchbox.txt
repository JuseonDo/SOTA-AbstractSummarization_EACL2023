 This material is cut from the leg of an old pair of jeans that has already been used for various other projects. You could also use part of an old dishtowel, fabric napkin, or other leftover fabric. Make sure the fabric is sturdy, washable, and clean.
 The pattern used here is a business sized mailing envelope 4 1/4 x 9 1/2 inches long (10.5 x 24cm). You can adjust the size for your cutlery, but remember to leave a seam allowance.

Make the smaller rectangle at least an inch (2.5cm) longer than the longest item you wish to carry.
 Place the long direction of the pattern with the grain of the fabric. Make one piece the size of the pattern and the other a bit longer. If the fabric already had a hem on one end, allow an extra inch (2.5cm) on the hemmed piece. If the fabric does not have an existing hem, allow an extra two inches (5cm)., Fold the fabric over and sew a straight hem. If the fabric already has a hem, skip this step., One hem should extend an inch (2.5cm) or more past the other hem.,, The hem of the longer piece should extend down past the hem of the shorter piece, and the folds should lie as shown. For ease of sewing, the hems should not be right on top of each other. You can trim the opposite ends (the ends without the hem) at this point if you need to adjust a bit., This is a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch (12mm). (The dark pen line is to show the location of the stitching in the photo. It is not necessary to draw the line.),, You can use the closed tip of a pair of scissors or the eraser end of a pencil to push the corners all the way out.,,
