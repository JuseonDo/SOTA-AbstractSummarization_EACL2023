 A gravity feed model is recommended because it allows the paint to naturally fall into place from the cup on top of the brush, which causes you to use less paint, creates a better finish, and allows you more control over your painting technique.;
, Make sure the air compressor can produce and least 40 psi and has a valve to adjust the air pressure up and down.
, This will help to remove any dirt or other residue as well as allow the paint to bond to the lure better.
 This prevents paint from sticking to it.
 Use a gentle, meticulous painting technique. Many painters blend and fade colors as their technique becomes more advanced. Have multiple fishing lures nearby so that you can start over if you make a mistake.
 This protects the paint and makes it waterproof. Hang up the lure, and allow it to dry. Dry times vary between brands of epoxy, and specific drying times are noted on the packaging.
