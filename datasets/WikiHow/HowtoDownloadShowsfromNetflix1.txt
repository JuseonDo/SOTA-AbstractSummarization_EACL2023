 When downloading shows and movies with the Netflix app, you'll be downloading a lot of data. Connect to a wireless network if you can so that you don't count against your data plan.
 If you're using an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android device, you can use the Netflix app to save some Netflix content for offline viewing. The app can be installed for free from your device's app store.

If you already have Netflix installed on your device, check your app store to see if the app is up to date. You'll need the latest version in order to save videos for offline viewing.
 Once the app is installed or updated, tap the Open button in the app store or tap the Netflix app on your Home screen or app list., If you've just installed the app for the first time, you'll need to log in with your Netflix account.
