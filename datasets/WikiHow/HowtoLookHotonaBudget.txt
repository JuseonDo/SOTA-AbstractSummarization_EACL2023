, A "good deal" on an item you never wear is actually a bad deal.
 Buy clothes that suit your body, coloring, sense of style, and existing wardrobe.
 The more outfits you can use something in, the better.
 Some pieces may be worth spending more money on because you will wear them often. Others will be worn seldom or even just once for a special occasion so should be purchased as inexpensively as possible. Try calculating the "cost per wear" of each item.
 Don't be pushed around by what the fashion industry says. You'll just end up spending a lot of cash on new clothes every season.
 It's cheaper to buy new costume jewelry, scarves, or hats every season than to buy a whole new wardrobe.
 Thrift stores and garage sales can give you huge bargains if you're willing to invest time and energy in finding them. Craft stores can provide accessories.
 Shop when the seasons change, or buy summer clothes in winter, and vice versa. Boxing Day sales are a great time to get bargains!
