 If using more than one color, choose your pattern carefully.
 Make sure the strips come out even.
 Start with your first color if you are using more than one color.
 Keep on painting for a larger doorframe, and stop earlier for a shorter doorframe.
 If the size seems too short or too long, either remove a strip or paint another one and attach it. If removing a strip, be very careful and gentle as you do so. Not doing this may result in some of the paper being pulled off with the tape.
 Repeat this process until the doorframe is covered entirely, or leave a small open space if desired.
