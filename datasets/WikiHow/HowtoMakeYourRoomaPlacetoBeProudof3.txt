 It is their house though, so make sure to ask first. Before you do any painting, make sure you really like the color.Â  You could buy a sample, paint a posterboard, and hang it on your wall to leave there for a few days, just to be sure you like it before you make any commitments.
 Only you know your style. If you don't have a ton of money to spend, check out garage sales or thrift shops. Usually they can have some nice stuff for a lot less money then it would be to buy it new.
