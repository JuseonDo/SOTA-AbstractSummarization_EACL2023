 Cat is a girl, and so is her room. It's white on the top half, and on the bottom half it's pink textured wood. If your wall isn't textured, paint it all pink or lavender. Brighter colors will not work with this room style.;
, Cat's furniture is white, and her bedspread is pink and orange. You can buy a bedspread like this at Pottery Barn Kids, Sears, Pottery Barn Teens, or Bed, Bath and Beyond. Cat's sheets are pink.
 Cat has a wooden floor, but if you want carpet, go for a darker color as this will tie the room together--like dark pink or purple.
 Cat has flowers all over her walls. Buy some wall stickers of flowers, hearts and butterflies. Be childish and stick them all over.
 All of Cat's furniture is lined up on one wall. Her dresser, her bed, and her nightstand.
