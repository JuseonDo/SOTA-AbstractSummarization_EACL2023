 If you're just starting to be horse crazy, research online about horses and find out the definitions of horse words like furlong, hands and martingale. You might like to research the different colors, breeds, and markings of horses as well.;
,, Remember though, as amazing as galloping on a beach on a beautiful Thoroughbred at sunset may sound, stick to the basics. You may be plodding round a soggy school at the back to a group in the pouring rain, but if you're truly horse crazy then it shouldn't really bother you. Make sure you check out the yard, the horses and maybe watch a lesson before you start there. The horse you will be riding and grooming should be trained in the four gaits (walk, trot, canter and gallop) and recognize the word 'stop' or 'whoa' so you can ride it safely with a good mind set. If you are a beginner, you should be riding a 'bombproof' horse that's roughly 8 years old.
 Don't, however, bore them with all you know about horses. They will know that you are horse crazy, but they'll probably become bored if they aren't into horses as much as you. They could become upset if all you ever talk about is horses because they may think you like horse more than your human friends (which you might, but don't tell them that!). This could result in arguments and all of you being upset. Instead, make friends that enjoy riding too. Someone that enjoys it as much as you will understand!
