 For some, the "only" way to eat spaghetti is with a fork and spoon. If you want to do this, use a standard dinner fork and a spoon that's a little wider and flatter than you'd normally use for other foods. If you don't have one, a standard spoon is fine.
 This is exactly like if you were just using a fork. Again, you don't want too many strands — this will make for a sloppy, unwieldy bundle of spaghetti.
 When you're working with a spoon, you do most of your maneuvering off of the plate. Use an up-and-down bouncing motion to separate your three or four strands from the rest of the pasta. Keep the fork pointed to the side or upward so the spaghetti strands don't slip off.
 Hold the spoon sideways so its inward curve is facing the fork. Press the tips of the fork gently into the curve of the spoon. Lift them, together, away from the rest of the spaghetti, but keep them over the plate to avoid spills.
 Keeping the fork sideways, start turning it against the spoon. The spaghetti should climb upwards and get wrapped around the fork. Keep wrapping until you have a tight bundle.


As you do this, use the spoon as a "surface" to wind the fork against. It's basically serving the same purpose as your plate normally would.
 Set the spoon down. Move the fork up to your mouth — just like you would if you were eating the spaghetti with a fork alone.
