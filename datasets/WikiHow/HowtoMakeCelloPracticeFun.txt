 When you aren't practicing specific pieces for a concert or chair test, play what you like. It makes practicing more fun and it can be a good challenge (some film music out there is pretty complex).;
, If you're practicing for, say two hours, take two or three 15min breaks to stretch, get something to drink/eat or just move around. Then go back to playing and continue taking breaks as needed.
,,, Every time you get through a piece without a single mistake, have a healthy treat you love like fresh raspberries, a small piece of dark chocolate or a favourite low cal savoury cracker.
 You don't have to play at the same time or play the same tune, you can take turns.
