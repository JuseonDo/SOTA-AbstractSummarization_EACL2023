 Use the resealable bags usually used for holding sandwiches.
 If you've overfilled the bag, you'll need to let out some of the water.
 Keep it there until it is frozen solid and is very cold to the touch.
 Turn on the hot water faucet in the kitchen.
 Wait until the water is hot before holding the ice under the stream. It will crack like an ice cube put in a glass.
 The act of bashing will "crush" the ice with ease.
