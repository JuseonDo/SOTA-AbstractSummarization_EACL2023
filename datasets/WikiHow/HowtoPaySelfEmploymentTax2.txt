 It is very important to calculate the precise amount as you wouldnâ€™t want any unpleasant surprises later.
 As of the 2008 tax year, if you earned $102,000 or less for the year, you must pay a 15.3 percent tax on your taxable earnings; however, if you earned over $102,000 for the year, you pay only 2.9 percent tax on your taxable earnings.
