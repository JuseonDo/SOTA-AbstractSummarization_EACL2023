@summary
if the gate is notorious, such as high sec to null sec jump, hang around the safe side with a normal cloak.

@summary
check local and d scan with narrow range.

@summary
when you see a shiny ship heading for your gate, make sure you are close to the gate.

@summary
wait on the other side.

@summary
when the first jumper de-cloaks, the campers will target him or her, and deploy their alpha and tackle.

@summary
align to the planet or other far away body that is closest to your current heading.

@summary
be ready to bounce from planet to planet, as hungry campers will watch which way you warp, and chase you down in fast tackle.

 Wait.
 Find others who are jumping towards the gate where you are at. You will know because if you point right at a station or other gate with minimum spread on the D scan, their ship will stay in view but the range will decrease rapidly.
 Right after the shiny ship has started to jump, de-cloak and jump yourself.
 Remember that the first jumper must decal before you, even if he or she waits out the gate cloak timer.
 This is your chance!

, Spam warp like there is no tomorrow. Do not touch MWD or AB modules. They will drastically reduce your warp away time.
 You are not safe in a camped system until cloaked or in a safe spot. If you have no safe spot, make one as you bounce around the planets.


Never warp directly between gates in null sec. Bounce around, and be careful.
