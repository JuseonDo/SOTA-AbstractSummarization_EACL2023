here's something you can do once you've build your house: mine the logs, (logs are the wood straight from the tree with bark and all, planks are logs that you get by crafting.

;
, One side will have the door, so be sure to leave a space in the middle for it.
 Place a wooden plank next to each new log, leaving space for windows (if desired).
, This should form a roof.
, If there are no torches on the inside, mobs will spawn inside your house.
 To start of, put in a crafting table, a furnace, a couple chests and a bed.
 This step is optional, but it will make your house look nicer.
 Since the new update, there are plenty of flowers to choose from. An alternating pattern will look the nicest.
 You need a flat roof, some dirt, ladders for getting up there (stairs are too cramped) water, fences and seeds. Lay out the fences along the edge of your roof, so you won't fall off.
 Make a deep (at least 3 blocks) hole underneath the floor, add ladders so you can climb down. Then start a tunnel leading to a secret room! Maybe a pool, a doghouse, a cool bedroom- anything you want! Remember, since this is a secret tunnel, nobody but you should know where it is.
 Place logs one block outwards from where they were in the beginning. You should now have a one-block space in between the corners of your house. Extend the roof to these logs. Underneath this new roof space is a good spot to add flowers.
