 Privacy standards prevent Uber from allowing riders to see an individual rating a driver has given them. However, you can see your average rating.
 Find the Uber app on your phone by looking for its icon in your apps or by searching for it. Then, tap on the icon.
 The menu button is displayed as three horizontal lines in the upper-left corner of the screen.
 A snapshot of your most recent trip will appear alongside a menu of options.
 A menu listing a number of issues will appear.
 This should be toward the top of the menu.
 You'll be taken to a page describing passenger ratings.
 A "Thank You" window will pop up containing your average trip rating.
