 Poster boards are a good source. You can also use some light colored sheets.;
, The ones that allow you to adjust them easily are the best ones to get.
 A kitchen table will do great.
 Thumb tacks or double sided tape should do the trick.
, Be aware that you probably can't go 'green' and use low wattage bulbs. The light will be different. If you have a digital camera, you might be able to adjust for this by adjusting your white balance.
