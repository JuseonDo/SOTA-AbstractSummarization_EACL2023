 This will snag the fibers and make them frayed. Also, never use your own brush on the doll's hair. The oil that comes off your hair will damage the doll.;
,, Don't go in the backyard and play in the dirt with your doll, it will get all messy. Keep your doll clean so you don't have to wash it. If you have a playhouse or slide, go up high. Bratz dolls can be washed, without damaged use a mild shampoo and conditioner for their hair.
 It is hard to pull the pants up so instead of ripping them you can put water on your dolls legs and it will slip up easier.
 Be careful who you let use your dolls.
 Make sure that you keep your dolls accessories in a safe place, like a ziploc bag, plastic container or a special Bratz case so they won't get lost. Earrings, rings, bracelets and sunglasses are easy to lose.
 Make sure you keep an eye on your Bratz because someone could take your Bratz doll. It could even be stolen (or sold) by one of your siblings!

, They will leave gashes in the doll's body and teeth marks. If you have a cat, they might think the Bratz hair are pieces of yarn., It should not get tangles after that. Also, don't let the doll sleep on your bed, due once again to the oil from your hair damaging the hair and you may also damage it by tossing and turning in your sleep.
 Leaving them on the floor or lying around somewhere within reach of small children or pets may cause damage to your doll.


Brush curly hair softly and gently - it may get puffy.
