 Stir until smooth to make a roux, then cook until a light chocolate brown colour, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Take off the heat just as it reaches this colour as it will continue to cook and continue to stir.
 When the sauce has cooked, you have made a base velouté.
 Add the tomato puree and velouté and stir well.
 Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and skim off any fat or foam when it builds up.
 This sauce can be used directly, modified into another sauce, or chilled or frozen for future use.
 Sauté 1 chopped shallot and 3 chopped or sliced mushrooms in a little butter. Add 100 mls of white wine and the Espagnole. You can also add some a skinned and de-seeded chopped tomato (known as a concasse) with the mushrooms and finely chopped herbs such as parsley, thyme etc. Season to taste.;
, Often cooked directly into a pan that had just fried meats. Add 1 chopped shallot and fry gently until soft in an pan-fat, then add 100mls of red wine and the Espagnole. When hot, whisk in 1 tsp of butter to enrich the sauce and season to taste. You can add a sprinkling of cayenne pepper to add flavour.
 This is frequently used in larger formal kitchens. Make a brown beef stock first and simmer until it has reduced and thickened slightly. Make and then add the Espagnole to a 1 to 1 ratio of sauce to stock, continue to simmer to reduce the sauce to a desired consistency. This sauce is best made in a large amount as it stores very well in the fridge or freezer for future use.
 Heat the espagnole and add 100ml of white wine, or a light red wine. Add the zest and juice of 1 orange and a tablespoon of redcurrant jelly or jam.
 Finely chop 50g of gherkins and stir into the Espagnole sauce.
