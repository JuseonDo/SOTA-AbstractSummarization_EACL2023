 It is the same as learning another language, you find the easiest things to remember and build up from that. In British Sign Language, it is the vowels.;
, This should be your dominant hand, which is your writing hand. If you are right handed, use your dominant right hand to sign onto your non-dominant (also called "weak") left hand. If you are left handed, do the opposite. However, with vowels, no shapes will be made. It is predominantly pointing with your index finger onto the fingers on your other hand.
 Hold out your left hand (for right handed people) or right hand (for left handed people) and point with your index finger on your writing hand to your thumb, touching it. Make sure they touch otherwise it could mean something completely different than what you want. Remember, when you sign the letter silently mouth the letter A as sign language is also helped by lip reading.
, Again, pointing with the index finger of your writing hand, lightly touch the second finger of your weak hand and mouth I.
, And remember, always mouth the letter or word.
