,, This is the iPhone's share button. This will show you many options from which you can use and view the Permalink of the app that you can share with friends on the web (If your friend doesn't have an iOS device, they'll be able to see the webpage of the information about the app, but won't be able to download the app.).
 Although these options will depend on what you have enabled on your Phone, Email, Messages are two beneficial places you can view and use this. However, if you'd like to send it other ways that aren't available on the screen, you can open it in a working tool, copy the complete link and paste it wherever you need to send it through. Copying it will copy the link to the iPhone's clipboard(with the "Copy Link" button) (which is uneditable by the average user, but can be overwrited with new data by copying new data from some other place).
 Customize the message, if you'd like, but make sure the link remains untouched.
