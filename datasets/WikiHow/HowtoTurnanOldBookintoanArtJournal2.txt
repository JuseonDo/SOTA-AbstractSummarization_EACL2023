 You have starting points with any pictures or text you have left - they might trigger an idea for a picture or journal entry., Add words and journal entries, or song lyrics and poems that you like., Find inspiration wherever you will, and recreate whatever you want in the book. Use watercolours, acrylic, oil pastels, and pencils to create art., Anything that takes your eye - food wrappers, stamps, labels.

If using something personal like an old photograph or perhaps a theatre ticket - it's a good idea to photocopy it (keeps the original safe).
