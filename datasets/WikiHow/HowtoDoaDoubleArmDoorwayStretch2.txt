keeping your upper arms at shoulder level, tense your stomach muscles and straighten your back.

switch your feet around after you relax for a few seconds and do the stretch again for the same amount of time.

 Now lean your upper body forward so you feel a stretch inside your chest. Hold this position for as long as you can (30 seconds is recommended if you're really straining).
 Stop if you feel too much discomfort, but remember, you can always adjust the stretch to fit your body's needs.
