In Windows Explorer,go to "Tools", "Folder Options". Then click on the tab called "View", and under "Hidden Files and Folders", click "Show Hidden Files and Folders".
 Once there, copy the file named "_volumelocked" to a folder on your hard drive then delete it from the iPod.
 Then, restart your iPod. You can do this by holding down the center and menu button for at least 6 seconds. If using an iPod Nano, hold down the center button and menu button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.
 Simply go into "Settings", "Volume Limit". If it asks for a PIN, you did it WRONG. Retry the above procedure.
