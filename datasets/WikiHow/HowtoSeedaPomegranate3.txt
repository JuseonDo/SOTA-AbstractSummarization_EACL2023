 Using a sharp knife, cut the pomegranate in two equal halves. You do not have to be precise, but try to be even. Set both halves on the counter, face down.
 Continue hitting the pomegranate until all the seeds fall out. Whack the pomegranate hard to dislodge many seeds at once.








For most pomegranates, three or four whacks is sufficient. If your seeds remain stuck, hit harder or use a larger spoon.
 After you have whacked the pomegranate halves, most seeds should be dislodged. To remove remaining seeds, use a smaller spoon and dig out any seeds left inside.
