 Any kind will do. Italian or French bread is a great choice if you've never considered it before. You could also use a bagel.

, Spread it over the bread. Prego brand sauce works really well.
 It doesn't matter even if it is individually wrapped cheese. American and mozzarella works great. Some toppings include pepperoni, mushrooms, ham, bacon and pineapple.
 If you use an oven, be sure to preheat it to at least 400 °F (204 °C), and check on it every couple of minutes.
