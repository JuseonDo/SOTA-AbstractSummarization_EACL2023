 Plantation shutters block out light the best. Curtains work well too. Avoid white cloth curtains, as they still let some light through.;
, Tape black construction paper onto the windows as a last resort if you don't have curtains. You will be surprised at its effectiveness.
 For computers, there will always be physical buttons on the frame of the screen. For TVs, you can also adjust it via remote.
 Light colors, especially white, reflect light and may make the room lighter also.
