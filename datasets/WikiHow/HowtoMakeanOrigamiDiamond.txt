@summary
get out a 6" by 6" piece of paper.

@summary
fold the paper from left to right or right to left.

@summary
fold the paper again, but this time from top to bottom, or bottom to top.

@summary
flip the paper.

@summary
make another diagonal fold, this time bringing the bottom left corner of the paper to the top right corner of the paper.

@summary
make sure your paper is now split into triangles.

@summary
once you have found this line, you should also find a line going up and down, splitting the line in half, so there should be a left part and a right part to the horizontal line.

@summary
identify the two triangles on your paper.

@summary
notice that the paper has two flaps.

@summary
flip the paper over, then repeat the previous step.

@summary
find the two parts of the diamond (not including the flaps).

@summary
fold the left part of the first part of this diamond to meet the center of the diamond.

@summary
,

@summary
flip the paper over, and repeat the last two steps.

@summary
flip the "diamond" upside down and notice the two pockets on each side of the "diamond".

@summary
flip the paper over, then repeat the previous step again.

@summary
blow gently into the bottom of the diamond, extending the top.

@summary
finished.

 It can be any kind of paper, though origami paper is best.;
, Crease the fold, then unfold the paper.
 Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. The paper should be split into fourths.
 Then make a diagonal fold, bringing the bottom right corner of the paper to the top left corner of the paper. Crease the fold, then unfold the paper.
 Crease the fold, then unfold the paper.
 There should be eight total triangles, and 2 triangles in each fourth of the paper. Anyway, there should be a fold starting from the left side of the paper all the way to the right side of the paper. Not a vertical line, not a diagonal line, but a horizontal line. It doesn't matter which way you place the paper. There should be a line from exactly left to right on the paper. If you didn't crease hard enough, you may have trouble identifying this line. But if you creased correctly, this line should be easy to spot.
 Next, bring both parts of the horizontal line together, forming a 3D figure.
 Push one of the triangles down on a flat surface, then bring the top triangle down on the bottom triangle. Keep on pushing until both triangles come together into one triangle. You should not be able to push the top triangle further down into the bottom triangle.
 Well, you are going to make more flaps! Before you make more flaps, you should see a crease in the center of the triangle, giving a right part and a left part to the triangle. Get hold of the right part of the flap, then fold up that flap to meet the crease in the center. After that, get hold of the left part of the flap, then foldÂ that flap to meet the crease in the center.



You should have a basic diamond shape right now, but there are still more steps.
 Fold the right part of the first part of this diamond to meet the center of the diamond.
, This time, use the second part of the diamond instead of the first part of the diamond.
 Extend the pockets with your fingertips, then notice the two flaps on each side of the diamond at the very top of the diamond. Slide each of the flaps at the very top of the diamond into each of the pockets.
, Make sure you keep the flaps down with your fingers because sometimes if you don't tuck the flaps in very well, the flaps might come out and you may have to start over.
