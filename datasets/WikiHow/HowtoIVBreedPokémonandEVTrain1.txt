,,

If possible, get a Pokémon with the ability Flame Body, like Volcarona.
, Repeat until you have 5 eggs in your party.,, Talk to him. He will ask to judge your Pokémon. Say yes.

He will judge all 5 eggs and tell you that they either have decent, above average, or outstanding. Your goal is to get outstanding.
Let's say you get a 2 Pokémon with an above average attack stat and they are opposite gender. You will want to take those two Pokémon back to the Day Care and switch them out. Deposit all Pokémon with decent potential. Keep them, though; they will come in handy later when picking another stat.
Once you put the two above average potential Pokémon in the Day Care, run around until you get an egg. Repeat until your party is full and once again, go back to Nimbasa City and go to the Battle Subway.
Let's say this time you get a male with a superior attack stat. Go back and swap out the male with the new one and deposit the rest of the babies.


Let's say this time they are all decent and above average except for the female with a superior attack stat. If you don't, repeat until you get the gender with superior stat. Take the female and the male out of the Day Care and give them both a Power Bracer. This will increase the chance of getting a Pokémon with outstanding attack.
 You will most likely get an outstanding Pokémon in the attack stat.,,, Go back to all your babies and get them potential checked until you have a male in female with a potential for defense.,,,,
