 While unfolding make sure the logo is on the ground. Since the logo is on the ground the suit should automatically open up. It is folded in two sections, one opens to the right and another to the left.;
, It's faster than an air compressor. So take a blower out, make sure it is filled fully with gas. Start it up so it is ready to go. Instructions on how to use it are on the blower.
 It is located on the bottom right of the logo

, It will be easier to control/hold the bubble as it inflates. If available place a object near so the suit can lean on it while inflating.
 Let the bubble inflate. Try your best to get the blower extension fully into the opening.
 This process has to be very quick and precise; it may take you few times to master it.
, The straps set inside go on your body just like a backpack straps do. Hang on tight and enjoy your game.
