note that the effectiveness of treating (and curing) breast cancer depends on how early it is detected.in some ways, the best form of "treatment" is prevention.

follow through with all screening tests.women are advised to receive a mammogram every two years from the age of 50 onwards.this is a specialized form of x-ray that can detect abnormalities in the breast.

@summary
receive genetic testing if you have a family history of breast cancer.if you have a family history of breast cancer, and the affected family member tests positive for the brca gene, you are also advised to be tested for the presence of this gene.

 This is why a huge effort has been made in the medical community to educate people about the importance of regular screenings for breast cancer, so that if any suspicious lumps are detected, their likelihood of being cured is as high as possible.
 If an abnormality is detected, further testing (such as an ultrasound, a biopsy of the abnormality, or possibly an MRI) will be performed to confirm whether or not it is breast cancer that needs to be treated.
 If you have it, it increases your chances of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The good news, however, is that if you test positive, you are aware of your heightened risk, and your doctor will offer you more screening tests than the average woman to optimize your chances of early detection and cure.


Women who are at high risk for getting breast cancer, like those with BRCA gene, will start getting mammograms earlier.
Some people who test positive for the gene also receive what is called a "prophylactic double mastectomy," meaning that they have their breasts removed before any cancer develops as a means of preventing it from occurring in the first place.
This is a matter of personal preference, as it does have a significant cosmetic impact.
