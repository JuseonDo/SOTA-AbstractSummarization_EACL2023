For a creamier version that's similar to lemon sherbet, you may substitute milk for any amount of the water. The more milk you add, the creamier the texture will be.
For an even richer, more decadent texture, you can substitute heavy cream for the water. This makes it more of a lemon ice cream and really tones down the tartness of the lemon.;
,,,, This is approximately 5 to 8 lemons depending on their size. Add 1 to 3 tbs. (15ml to 45ml) lemon zest and mix well.

When serving, you can top your sorbet with a mint leaf for a lovely green garnish. Or you can top with fresh raspberries, strawberries, or blueberries for a colorful twist. Even a dollop of fresh whipped cream and a sprinkle of lemon zest can make for an eye-catching garnish.
