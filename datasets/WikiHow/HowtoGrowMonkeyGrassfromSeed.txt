 These blossoms usually arrive in late summer or early fall.


Clip the blossom stems that hold the seeds. Dry the stems by hanging them in a room with good circulation.
Pull the seeds from the stem by hand. They should fall off fairly easily.
If you get monkey grass from a landscape or garden supplier, make sure the seeds are fresh. Monkey grass will not store for longer than 2 weeks, without losing its capacity to germinate. They should be stored in wet or humid conditions.;
, Choose a time when there will be some sun, but not much rain. Monkey grass seeds are easily washed away.


If you live in colder, northern climates, you will have a better chance of germination if you buy seeds and plant in the early spring.
, Weeds compete for the same soil nutrients that the grass will need to germinate and grow.


The type of weeds will vary widely depending upon your location. Weeding can be done with a rake and by hand with smaller or deeply rooted weeds.
 Use a tiller to combine the compost into the soil. You can also use fertilizers with urea, ammonia and sulfate to add acid to the soil.
, They should be 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) deep, if you want to contain monkey grass. Most varietals of monkey grass are aggressive and they will take over surrounding areas if dividers aren't used.
 The amount you need will depend upon the area you want to fill. You will need to plant the seeds in 3 different areas, so divide your seeds into 3 equal groups.
 Sprinkle a third of the seeds into the soil in this direction.
,,, It should be moist while the seeds germinate. Seeds should sprout within 1 month.
