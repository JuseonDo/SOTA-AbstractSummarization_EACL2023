 Everything after this line, before the adjusted gross income, are adjustments.


Additions Of Taxable Interest, and Unemployment on the 1040-EZ; Taxable Interest, Dividends, Capital Gains, Ira Distributions, Pensions, Unemployment, SSA Benefits, And Deductions Of Educator Expenses, Ira Deductions, Student Loan Interest Deductions, Tuition And Fees Deductions on the 1040-A; and others on the 1040.
 The majority of adjustments are available year to year, others are only available as passed. These are adjustments allowed only for certain qualified claimants that congress must approve on a yearly basis such as the Educator's Allowance for teachers. You can go to the IRS web site, usually in December, and the adjustments should be listed there. Be careful to look for them. The most common credits are:


For Earned Income Credit Schedule EIC, sometimes called the Earned Income Tax Credit, use the form with Pub 596,
Child Tax Credit (Publ 972),
Dependent Child Care Expenses (Publ 2441).
Additional Child Tax Credit (Publ 8812). Additional here doesn't mean more, it means another. The Additional Child Tax Credit is a refundable tax credit for people who have a qualifying child and did not receive the full amount of the Child Tax Credit. If you qualify for the full, regular Child Tax Credit, you can't claim the Additional Child Tax Credit.
 There are some that are allowed even though you do not itemize.
,, Just do the math, check your figures, sign the form, and relax over a job well done.
