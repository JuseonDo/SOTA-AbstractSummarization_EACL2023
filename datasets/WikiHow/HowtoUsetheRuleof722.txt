@summary
estimate the time it would take to lose half of your money (or its purchasing power in the wake of inflation).

@summary
estimate the rate of decay (r) over a given time span: r = 72 รท t. enter a value for t, and solve for r. for example:

@summary
if the buying power of $100 becomes worth only $50 in ten years, what is the inflation rate during that time?,

@summary
ignore any unusual data.

 Solve T = 72 รท R. This is the same equation as above, just slightly rearranged. You simply enter a value for R. For example:


How long will it take for $100 to assume the purchasing power of $50, given an inflation rate of 5% per year?

Let 5 x T = 72, so that T = 72 รท 5, meaning T = 14.4. That's how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5% inflation.


R x 10 = 72, where T = 10. Then R = 72 รท 10 = 7.2%.
 If you detect general trends, don't worry about numbers that are wildly out of range. Drop them from consideration.
