 Iron is critical for energy, healthy metabolism, and healthy red blood cells. Taken together, vitamin C and iron improve the absorption (and boost the strength) of one another.Foods like spinach, kale, collard greens contain both iron and vitamin C naturally.
Try pairing lemon (high in vitamin C) with high-iron foods like spirulina (in a smoothie) or quinoa and lentils (in a salad).
Another example is to use both red peppers (which contain vitamin C) with iron-rich black beans in a burrito.
 Calcium does the work of building healthy bones, vitamin D aids in calcium absorption, and vitamin K directs the calcium to where it is needed most.Scramble some eggs (vitamin D) with spinach (vitamin K) and cheese (calcium).
 The combination of these vitamins is far stronger than either vitamin taken alone. Additionally, this winning combination helps to reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries, leading to increased arterial elasticity.Enjoy a bowl of berries and citrus fruits (both high in vitamin C) sprinkled with pumpkin and sunflower seeds (both high in vitamin E).
 When these three minerals are consumed together, they form a “group dynamic” that works to promote proper nerve function and electrolyte balance, as well as reducing blood pressure.Start your morning with a bowl of oats (high in magnesium), topped with bananas (high in potassium), and a dollop of yogurt (high in calcium).
