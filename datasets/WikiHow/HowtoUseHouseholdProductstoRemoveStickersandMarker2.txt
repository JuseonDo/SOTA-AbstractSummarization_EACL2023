 Although you can use this method on nearly any surface or item, in some cases, such as fabric you may want to consider turning to a professional for removal.
 Skip using the fancy or expensive stuff--this project works well with any type (so save the expensive hairspray for your hair).
 Hold the can approximately 2 to 3” away from the marker and completely cover the marker area.
 You may need to rub the area or blot it at first if you don’t want the marker onto other areas of the item (especially if you are dealing with fabric or other porous items).
 Stubborn or old marker may take a few passes before it lifts. Repeat the process and even consider allowing the hairspray to sit for a longer amount of time before wiping clean.
