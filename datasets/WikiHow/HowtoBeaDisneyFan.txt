 Like Aladdin, Pocahontas or Mulan. They have good lessons and are funny. They all have something for everybody!;
, Since most of the classics are currently on vault, you can buy them off of amazon.com or ebay. Make sure you watch them all. If you don't know the names of them, just look up "list of Disney classic movies"

, They actually have a lot of views! Each song is unique and perfect. It's also not auto tuned, so you know that the singers can sing.
 You can figure out how old Disney characters are, or what year it took place in. Also, look for Disney characters making cameo appearances in other Disney movies! Did you know Belle from "Beauty and the Beast" makes an appearance in"The Hunchback of Notre Dame"?

, Disney characters have realistic feelings and emotions. Take Megara for example, she is in love with Hercules but won't admit it because she's been hurt before by her old boyfriend. Has that ever happened to you?

, That's why you'll see a lot of negative comments on Disney videos on YouTube.
 choose your favourite Disney villain, princess, prince, etc.
 Once you connect with it, you will love it and want to learn more.
 They will tell you how much you know about Disney. But remember, you don't have to know every single Disney fact to be a true fan! You just have to enjoy the movies!

, after all "A dream is a wish your heart makes"!
