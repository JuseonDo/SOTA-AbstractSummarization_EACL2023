 Spend at least 5 - 10 minutes stretching and warming up before doing parkour. Do everything, but focus on ankles, legs, knees, butt and shins.;
, You don't have to be able to jump over it, but pick an obstacle you can vault over normally with ease. Also make sure of what's on the other side - vaulting into a 5 meter drop is a recipe for disaster. Rails are the easiest obstacle to start with. The obstacle mustn't be too low, either - it should ideally be somewhere around your belly button or slightly higher.
,, Make sure there's enough room for your feet to get between them, but at the same time make sure they are not too wide or your legs will be lower and your feet will get clipped.
 Make sure not to clip the rail with your feet, so tuck up a lot! As you jump try to push yourself forwards, this will stop your shins falling onto the bar.
 I can't stress this enough. The main reason to lean forward is so that you don't clip your feet. When you lean forward, your feet will be higher and won't get clipped.
 Pick a spot for your feet to land.
 try to land softly, minimizing impact.
 Now do it all over again.
