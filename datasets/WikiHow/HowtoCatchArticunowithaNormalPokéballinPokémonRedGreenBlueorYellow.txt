, If you're playing FireRed, LeafGreen, HeartGold or SoulSilver, catch a Pokémon that can learn False Swipe. One such Pokémon is Scyther. This allows you to lower Articuno's HP down to 1 without causing it to faint. Also, bring a Pokémon that can put Articuno to sleep.
 First, put Articuno to sleep. Then use Super Fang or False Swipe until Articuno's HP is very low. If it wakes up, put it to sleep again.
 Keep on doing this until it stays in. Then, voila! You got yourself an Articuno!
