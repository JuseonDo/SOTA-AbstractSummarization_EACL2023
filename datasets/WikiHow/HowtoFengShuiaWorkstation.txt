 This ensures that you are not surprised by visitors, causing a feeling of insecurity. The idea is that by facing the entranceway, you are prepared, and if your back is against a wall, it is covered and supported by a mountain. You also want to make sure that you are not positioned between the door and a window where draught of chi usually exists.;
, Never place your desk in front of a window where you can be distracted by the view and your chi may be drained from the room.
 For this reason, your desk should be in good condition and organized. In essence, it should mirror the success your wish to achieve for your business.
 A chair is your mountain and therefore, should support you, help instill concentration, and soothe your chi. Just like your desk, it needs to be in good condition.
 Chi cannot flow well in an area with sharp objects. It becomes pricked. Sharp objects also include plants with thin, sharp leaves.
 Remember that wood denotes growth and that colors such as cream, yellow, and beige signify stability.
 Clean as you go, rather than allowing the mess to pile up. If you keep your workstation clear of clutter on a regular basis, your mind will always be focused.
 For example, if your business is in sales and it is your job to build relationships, communicate with clients, and find new contacts, then you should incorporate images that are inspiring and friendly. In contrast, if your objective is to study, then images of stability would be more appropriate.
 Plants represent 2 elements, wood and earth, and these improve health.
 Paperwork that is completed and not currently in use is a reminder of the past, therefore it should be stored out of sight. According to Feng Shui principles, documents from the past are a reminder of the past and will hinder you from moving forward or focusing on the journey ahead.
