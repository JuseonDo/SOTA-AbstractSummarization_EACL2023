 Use a very light coat and a light touch. Apply to adjacent areas in order to blend as you go.


Remove any excess stain from the brush with a rag. Remember to use more care with applying gel stain than you usually would with wood stain. Always pull toward you, pick up the brush and apply a downward stroke toward yourself again.
 You may also consider applying the same stain to other matching wood furniture in the area for a more cohesive look.
 Assess the look to decide if you want to add another coat. This will darken the cherry stain.
 You can use spar varnish, acrylic urethane or polyurethane.
 Go over the surface with a tack cloth once it is dry and before you add another coat.
 Allow it to dry completely before touching anything.
 Once it has had a few days to cure, reattach the hinges and place the drawers in the cabinetry.
