Clear cellophane would be best. If this is for a graduation ceremony, however, consider using one of the school colors instead.;
,


Small candy bars, such as the kind sold during Halloween, work best for this.
If you are using small candies, such as Hershey's Kisses or Starburst, you can pile them in groups of 3 to 4. If you are using larger candy bars, arrange them in groups of one., If you need to, use your finger to separate the candy after you have finished rolling it up in the cellophane.
 If this is for graduation, consider using the school's colors.
 You can do a simple double-knot, or you can tie the ribbon into a fancy bow.


If you are using curling ribbon, consider curling the ends. You can do this by pulling the ribbon between your thumb and the pair of scissors.
 Be sure to tie the ribbon into a tight, double knot. If you want, you can tie the ends off into a bow, or curl them instead.
