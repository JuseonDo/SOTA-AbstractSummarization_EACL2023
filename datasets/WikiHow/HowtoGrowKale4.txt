 Depending on the amount of sun your plants receive, you may have to water them as often as every day.
 Fertilizer helps the kale grow strong and robust and keeps it producing healthy, sweet leaves.
 Make sure that the kale is at least six inches tall before you mulch your plants. Mulching helps prevent wet soil from sticking to leaves and molding them.
 Doing so helps to reduce the chance of harmful pests.
 The plant should be at least eight inches tall before you harvest the leaves. Be aware that growing time varies according to each variety, so be sure to look up the appropriate time before harvesting.


Pick off the outside leaves first if just harvesting individual leaves.
If harvesting the entire plant, cut the stem down to about two inches above the soil with one clean cut. This will allow the plant to continue to produce leaves.
Don't leave the leaves on the plant for too long after they are ready for harvest. Doing so will produce bitter, tough leaves.,
