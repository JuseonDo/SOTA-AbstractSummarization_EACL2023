@article
 There is nothing anyone can do or say to you to hurt you when you become emotionally free. Most people are like a sponge soaking up all the hurts, disappointments, regrets; ending up in resentment, anger, not to mention depression.;
, You know the importance of keeping things clean - from your body to your home. If you do not clean up, you end up in filth, and that can be deadly. The same goes for your mind. a negative mind can be deadly too.
, Know that if you're not then the person or situation is pressing your emotional buttons and in turn lowering your energy, and eventually causing illnesses.
 Take responsibility, stop condemning the other person or situation just for five minutes.
 Sit down in a place where you are not going to be disturbed.
, I am angry because - I am hurt because - I am disappointed because - I am sad because - you may think of other headings.
 I am hurt because Mary said I looked a mess. I am hurt because I think Mary thinks I look old. I am hurt because she is so unkind to me. I am hurt because she doesn't criticize other people - only me. I am hurt because she picks on me all the time. So on........ until nothing else comes to mind.
 I am angry Mary dares to criticize me. I am angry that she has the audacity to treat me this way. I am angry that she treats me as if I am totally incapable - and so on.
 You may find you sigh during the process - that's a good inclination that you are getting it all out of your mind.
 If the thoughts haven't all gone then know there is still more work to do.
 If you have some resentments that are still lingering know that they are lowering your energy and leading and/or will lead to some form of ill health.
