 Membership of a recognized travel body, while not a guarantee of quality, is a good indication that the firm you are looking at is reputable and trustworthy.;
, Bonding means that if the company goes bankrupt you are protected financially and proper insurance not only provides protection but is another good sign of quality as an operator cannot get insurance without having well prepared operational and risk management plans.
 In order to operate legally in Tanzania operators have to be licensed by the TTB. As it is against Tanzanian laws for a foreign company to operate mountain trekking, some operators have local partners.
 Two guides for just one climber might seem excessive but even guides can get ill or have an accident. With two or more climbers, maintaining a high guide ratio ensures that the needs of every climber can be looked after

, Group climbs and fixed itineraries can be cheaper but the real price paid is that the success rate is lower and a cheap climb that doesn’t get you to the top can later seem very expensive

, Kilimanjaro is a very tough environment and a small cramped tent that leaks will spoil your climb as surely as a lack of good quality food

, Flight delays and lost luggage are an all too familiar part of life in Africa so ask what happens if you arrive a day after the climb is scheduled to start. Has it left without you?

, Sadly some people will get sick on Kilimanjaro and be forced to descend. Check it is possible to continue so that at least some can summit.
, Get some email addresses, or better phone numbers, and check out previous customers yourselves.
