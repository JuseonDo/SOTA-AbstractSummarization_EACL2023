 This will help you with items that you aren't familiar with. If you don't have it, try searching the Internet. You can probably find it.
 This flashes when your front curtain is completely open. This is usually enough to do stop motion photography.
, This is different things (acronyms) on different camera. You should know what your camera calls it.
 This would be (usually), 1.4, 2, 3.5, etc. It will depend on your lens. This allows the most light into your camera.
 Cloudy, filtered, sunny, etc. Write down all of the relevant information, if it will help.
, You aren't trying for Ansel Adams here. You want to learn what your camera and flash will do under certain situations.
 Know which of your notes/observations go with which image.

Do not shoot at distances that will over or underexpose the shot. If a shot is overexposed, don't shoot closer to the subject unless the camera is set to a narrower aperture (i.e. larger f/number). If it is underexposed, don't shoot further from the subject unless the camera is set to a wider aperture (i.e. smaller f/number).
 Use those settings as a guide for that particular environment.
 Some that you will want to experiment with are:

Low light






Direct sunlight






At night






Sporting events






Ceremonies






Races
