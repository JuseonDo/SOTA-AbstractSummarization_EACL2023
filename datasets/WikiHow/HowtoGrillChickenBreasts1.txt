@summary
prepare the grill to help the chicken cook better.

@summary
light the grill, according to your model's instructions, and let preheat on a medium-hot setting for about 5 minutes before placing the chicken onto the grill.

@summary
check the bottom side of the chicken breasts after about 3 minutes and flip them when they begin to look opaque.

@summary
grill the other side for approximately 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts.
@article
 Use a grill scraper to remove any residue from the grill. Lightly spray the cooking surface with non-stick spray so the chicken will not stick to it.






;
, Do not overcrowd the chicken breasts on the grill or they may stick together and be difficult to flip over. Let them sit for about 3 minutes without turning.
 Cook for about 2 or 3 more minutes if they're still pink.









Turn down the heat if it looks like the outside of the chicken is getting blackened, since this could mean the chicken is burnt on the outside but still raw inside.
 Grill thin cut portions for a shorter amount of time, and grill thicker ones longer.









Check after about 5 minutes to see if the chicken appears to be a solid color with no visible pinkness.
Use a meat and poultry thermometer to make sure that the internal temperature of the chicken has reached 185 degrees. Make sure any juices that run out of the chicken breast when you insert the thermometer run clear.
