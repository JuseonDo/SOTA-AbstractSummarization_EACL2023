 It does not have to be massive, but not tiny either. It just needs enough room for all the equipment necessary. If you want you can put a front desk in and a booth for trading., Depending on how big your daycare is, limits the amount of trading machines you can have., Now just advertise your daycare and let the cash and Pok√©mon come rolling in.
