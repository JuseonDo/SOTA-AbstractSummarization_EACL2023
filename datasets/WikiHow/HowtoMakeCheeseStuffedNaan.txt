 In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the yeast, sugar and 3 tablespoons warm milk. Cover and set aside for 5-10 minutes.;
, In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, yogurt, oil, and salt, then slowly incorporate it into the flour.
 If using a mixer, use the dough hook attachment for about 10 minutes. To mix by hand, bring the ingredients together with a fork and then knead on a lightly floured work surface until smooth, also about 10 minutes.
 Place it in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place. Wait until it doubles in size, which can take 1-2 hours.
, Roll each piece into a ball, cover the balls loosely with plastic wrap, and allow them to double in size once again.
 Preheat to 475–500 °F (246–260 °C).
 Place 1 tablespoon of your stuffing in the middle and fold the dough in half. Roll each piece into an oblong shape with your hands.
