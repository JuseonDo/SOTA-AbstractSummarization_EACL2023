 Your toddler is more likely to become a willing participant in a reflexology session if he/she sees it as a fun activity. Consider, for example, suggesting that the two of you massage the feet or paws of your toddler’s favorite stuffed animals or dolls.
 Let him know it is a pleasant experience for you. Most toddlers love to please their parents.
 Make the whole session fun.
 Play soft music, lower the lights and try to have each reflexology session at the same time of the day. Toddlers love routines and when they see and hear reflexology cues, they will be more likely to cooperate.
 The last thing you want is for your toddler to think of reflexology as a punishment or as a stifling activity.
