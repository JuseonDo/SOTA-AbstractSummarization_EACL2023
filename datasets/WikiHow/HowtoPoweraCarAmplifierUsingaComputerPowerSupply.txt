 In the power supply packaging (if bought new) there should be a pinout diagram. Look for the pin that says something along the lines of “Power on”, "PS OK" or other key words that indicates a on signal. It will be on the biggest pigtail.


99% of the time it will be a green wire on new power supplies, but for older power supply “10+ years” the wire could be yellow or purple. If your power supply did not come with a pinout diagram, check the manufacturer website for a pinout diagram.

Use electrical tape to bundle them together exposing their strip ends on one side. If using a soldering iron, solder all the ends together.

 Some amplifiers might just say “12v” instead of the “+”.
 Some amplifiers might just say “GROUND” instead of the “-”.
