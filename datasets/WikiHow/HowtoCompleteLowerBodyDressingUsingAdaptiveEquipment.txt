 The dressing stick has two hooks on one end. Use the hook pointing down, slip it in the heel of your shoe, and push! Off goes your shoe!;
, In a similar manner used to take off your shoes, place the hook in the heel of your sock, and push! Voila!

, Use the dressing stick to help push each pant leg off your legs.
, Pull the sock all the way up the sock aid, so the end of the sock is flush with the end of the sock aid. Be sure not to pull it any higher than the handles.


Toss the sock aid to the floor, holding onto the handles.
Slip your toes into the sock aid, point your toes, and pull up! On goes the sock! If the sock is not as high as you'd like, use the reacher to pull the sock higher.
 Use the hooks to draw the pants up until you are able to reach with your own hands. Stand, and pull your pants up.



If the tongue of the shoe slid down, use the reacher to pull it up.
