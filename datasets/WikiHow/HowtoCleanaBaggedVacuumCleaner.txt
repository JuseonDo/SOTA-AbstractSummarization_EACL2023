 In most cases, it requires you to push a button or lift a latch.
 Different vacuum cleaners have different mechanisms for pulling out the bag. After you have pulled the bag out, it is time to see how full the bag is.
 If no air can pass through the bag because of too much dirt in it, the vacuum cleaner will not properly perform its job.
If the bag is half or more than half full, it is the time to change the bag. An important thing to consider while buying a new bag is the right size.
 Check it by tugging and pulling gently a few times to make sure that it is perfectly secured.
 The brush roll is located at the bottom of your vacuum cleaner and in most cases to the front of the bottom.
 This will give you an idea of which side you must insert the roller back into its position after you have cleaned it. Look for any push buttons or latches that might require you to pull the brush roll out.
 Use a pair of scissors if there are too many strands of hair and threads stuck in the brush.

 When you vacuum is clean and dry, plug it in and test it out. Your cleaning power should be improved!
