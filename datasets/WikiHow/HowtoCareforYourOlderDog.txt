 Some dogs' coats begin to gray, they don't jump up as quickly when they see you, they may not see you completely (cataracts, glaucoma, etc.), walking up stairs may take a bit longer, they may not respond when you call them, they seem to have forgotten most of their training - or they may seem to mope a little more each day or act grumpy.;
, Some ailments are a part of natural aging, however you never know when that frequent urination is because of a larger problem. When your dog is older, you can't overlook what may seem like a temporary problem.
 Just tone it down a bit within Old Yeller's comfort zone. Exercise keeps those old arthritic bones oiled.
 Many dogs gain or lose weight with age, so keep an eye on the diet. Your dog can benefit from the same nutrients as you, so try to choose whole foods with antioxidants, omega 3's, alpha linolenic acid (ALA)(to help reduce inflammation) - ProPlan and Nutro have holistic foods for seniors.
, If she's disinterested in her old toys, try something new - softer, smaller, squishier.
 Old boy doesn't want to go in the house, but sometimes it goes otherwise.
, Maybe even give a little canned food occasionally. Dry food can be moistened with water to make for easier chewing.
 Keep the teeth clean (if possible), check the ears, skin and coat for irregularities. Be sure to keep everything flea-free and avoid harsh chemicals.
