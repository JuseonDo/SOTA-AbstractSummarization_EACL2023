 "I don't feel like it" may be enough of a reason for you, but it might not be enough for your family.;
, If you normally like to go to church but you don't care for it any more, consider talking to your family about the reason why. If you never liked church and you want to stop going, go on to the next steps.
 If your family goes to church on a regular basis and expects you to go along, you will have to either explain your situation or bargain with them.
 Tell them you will still keep going to church, but you want to skip just this once.
 Offer to go to one of those activities instead of attending church with your parents.
 If you're mature enough to make your own decisions and have your own beliefs, explain your own spiritual situation to your parents and family. Maybe you've simply lost interest in their church, but you still share the same faith. Or maybe your spiritual beliefs no longer align with theirs. Either way, try to spark a serious talk with your family about your faith and explain to them why you don't want to attend church.
 If you don't want to go because you feel your family's religion is not right for you, think it over carefully and articulate the reasons. Write down exactly how you feel, in as clear and detailed a manner as possible. Think like you're presenting an argument for the debate team, so don't be impassioned and irrational about it. Explain how you feel to your family and be prepared for some resistance since this is a big declaration to make.
 Chances are they will say yes. Then say "Well, how do you think it makes ME feel to be dragged to church without any say?" Try to protest about it so much that it gets on their nerves and then you eventually won't have to go to church.
