, Confidence is the key in driving, so when you are in the presence of someone with experience, they can guide and give you tips.
 The most common parking positions are uphill, downhill, parallel, and slant. You must know how and when to turn the steering wheel when going into a stall and reversing.
 As you progress, you can try driving at night with caution.
 Use high-beams when there is absolutely no one in your path of sight, including transportation on the other side of the road AND if there are no road lamps (the road is completely dark).
 Ask your parents if they would let you drive to the supermarket for them to shop for groceries or any other small places they would go.
 Try to stay away from racing schools and focus on hands-on training that focuses on crash prevention. Right now Massachusetts is the only state in the country certifying this type of training. They call it Driver Skills Development Program and you can find details here http://www.mass.gov/rmv/driversed/selectschool.htm
