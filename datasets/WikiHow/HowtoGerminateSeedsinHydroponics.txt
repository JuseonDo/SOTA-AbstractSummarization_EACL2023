 Most people either use peat pellets or rockwool cubes. Either is a fine choice as they are both neutral so won't harm your seeds or seedlings and they both allow enough moisture and air to allow your seeds to grow.;
,, You want to place a couple of seeds in case any don't sprout and you can always remove any extra sprouts if you want to.
, At the initial stage use plain and distilled water and later add nutrient- solution to keep your growing system moist. And, once the plant is 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall provide more and more food. Once the plant reaches a height of 2 inches (5.1 cm), apply full strength plant food.
 You can choose either an active or a passive hydroponics system. Active hydroponic systems use artificial method for germination process while passive hydroponic systems carry out germination process naturally. Water culture system is also one reliable system where there is no need of a growing media but you can easily grow plants in water.
