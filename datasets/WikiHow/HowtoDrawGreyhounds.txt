 Having a picture to look off of will make it easier to get the drawing proportionally correct, and will help you with where to put the darkest shadows.
 Start with the back and neck and then move to the face, as this will help you get the correct sizes. Pay close attention to your reference photo and the placement of features.


Keeping the neck looking long and skinny will help you make is look like a greyhound. Also create a long, pointed nose.
 This will allow you to make sure the stomach is shaped correctly. The stomach should resemble the shape of the dog's ribs, meaning it will peak high towards the hind legs. This creates the skinny look of a greyhound.
 The legs should be skinny and long.
 This will be a smooth continuation of the belly. Notice the curves and shape the legs have, as well as the angle it is at.
 Once you've done this, you may decide you need to adjust the angle or shape of the leg.
 It should be a similar shape, but may be positioned differently.
 It should be skinny with a rounded end.
 When drawing the ears, keep them perked up as this is common in a greyhound. Also make sure the nose looks long and pointed.
 They will be a more rounded shape than most dogs.
 The actual nose will have details in it such as the nostrils. The mouth will likely curve down at the end, creating the facial expression you typically see on a greyhound.
,,,, Because the greyhound has short fur, it reflects more. Therefore shadows may not be where you expect. See your reference photo to help you.
 Don't worry too much about blending them out yet, but try not to create harsh lines unless that is how it appears in your reference photo.
, This can be done with a blending stump, your finger, or a pencil.
 Keep light or reflective spots white.
