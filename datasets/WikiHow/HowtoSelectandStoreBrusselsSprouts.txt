 They should be brightly colored. Avoid purchasing any with yellowed leaves unless you intend to use them in a stew or casserole.;
, To ensure even cooking, look for sprouts that are roughly the same size as a whole. The smaller sprouts are the best because they are more tender and therefore tastier.
 They should be firm and without soft or loose leaves.
 Place in the fridge. Use within a week of purchase.
