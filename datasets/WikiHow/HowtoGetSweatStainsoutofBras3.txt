Lemon juice should only be used to clean white bras. It can further stain colored fabrics so do not use this method for patterned or solid colored bras., Be sure to saturate every part of the stain. You can use an old toothbrush to rub the lemon juice into the fabric., This gives the lemon juice time to soak into the fabric and remove the stain., Do not wring out the bra, but gently press the water out of it. Try gently rolling up your bra in a clean towel to remove the excess water., The sun is an excellent bleaching agent, so this will help remove any lingering stains.Using a dryer to dry your bras can damage the fabric, including the elastic and underwire, and leave your bras misshapen.
