You will need a minimum down payment of 10,000 Bells towards their mortgage and you will also have to have spent at least 12,000 Bells in the store. It will take 10 days after the creation of the Town for the option to upgrade to appear.;

 Dr. Shrunk should be outside. He will automatically talk to you. He is the owner of Club LOL.
