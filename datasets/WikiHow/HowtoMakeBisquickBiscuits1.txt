Combine these dry ingredients quickly and loosely in a large bowl — make sure there's a little extra space for the wet ingredients you're about to add.



For ideal texture, use a technique called "cutting in" to add the butter to the mixture. While the butter is still cold, chop it into small pieces and toss each piece separately into the mixture. Coat each piece with the dry ingredients, then use a pastry mixer, two knives, or your fingers to break the butter pieces up.



Stop stirring when the dry ingredients are well-combined — it's possible to over-stir, giving the biscuits a tough, crumbly quality.,


Turn the dough onto surface sprinkled with Bisquick or flour.
Knead the dough about 10 times. Don't knead excessively — as with stirring, this can affect the texture of the biscuits.
Roll the dough about 1/2 inch thick. To prevent the dough from sticking to the roller, you can sprinkle it with flour or bisquick.
For a crunchier crust, skip the kneading and rolling and simply drop biscuit-sized spoonfuls directly onto the baking sheet.



If you don't have a biscuit cutter, either use a knife to cut squares or cut rounds with an upside-down drinking glass.
A little flour or extra Bisquick on the knife or glass will help keep things from sticking.



Leave about an inch or two of space around each biscuit on the cookie sheet. This ensures the biscuits will heat from all sides evenly.



Check on your biscuits while they cook — cooking times may vary slightly based on the oven being used.
Note that cooking times increase slightly at high altitudes.,


After removing the biscuits from the oven, loosen them from the tray with a spatula so they don't stick.
After about a minute, transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack. The biscuits are ready to eat when they are cool enough to handle.
