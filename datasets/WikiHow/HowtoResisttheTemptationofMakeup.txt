 Reasons that are personal to you will be more important than anything this article can suggest. Does it go against your personal beliefs? How?
, The cost of makeup is very high and expensive. Steer clear of the beauty counters at the mall or the drugstore samples. Also, if you already bought some makeup, but want to stop wearing it, store it away in another room or in a box in the basement. Then, don't go to it again., Comb your hair and keep it cut in a style you like. Trim and file your nails. Make it a daily routine to wash your face and apply a moisturizing lotion before venturing out, especially one with a daily sunscreen. Use a colorless lip balm if the air is dry. Brush your teeth regularly. This is all just good grooming., Besides being good for your health and your figure, it will help keep your skin clear, and give you a natural glow otherwise known as confidence., Appreciate that you don't have to worry about lipstick smears on cups or clothing.,,,

Be proud to show the world that eyelids aren't really dark blue and lips aren't really bright red. Plain skin is honest and real. There's nothing wrong with that., People can be beautiful without looking exactly like the unnaturally skinny models who have been done up by professional makeup artists and then digitally post-processed., The easier way to look natural is to be natural., Wear your favorite colors, styles and accessories, whether or not they're the in thing this year., Paint, sing, dance, write, talk, or do what you like. You'll communicate far more than by painting your face., You are far more than a layer of powder and paint. Let the real you shine through., You will improve your appearance instantly, no makeup involved.
