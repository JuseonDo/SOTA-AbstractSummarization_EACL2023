Firstly, bank all stuff in Lumbridge Bank after the tutorial.






Next, run to Varrock and go towards the guards in the castle.if you run out of run energy right click the boot and select rest. The castle is north of the main fountain. Make sure there are lots of bones around.






Then, pick them up. You can sell them in the Grand Exchange for about 101gp.






Pick up 28 and bank in south-west of the castle and repeat until you have about 500, then bravo, because you have made yourself 50.5K or 55,000GP!






Then, you should merchant or Runecraft (after the Rune Mysteries quest) until your desired amount of money wanted is in hand!
