 Before you apply your makeup, wash your face with a gentle soap or facial wash. After you have cleaned your face, pat your face dry with a soft towel. Don't rub, or it will irritate the skin. Using a soft towel will make things easier.;
, Make sure you give special attention to areas that are usually dry. Since you won't be wearing any foundation, I recommend using a moisturizer which evens out your skin tone, such as Aveeno's Positively Radiant Moisturizer, You can find this lotion at your local drugstore.
 Use concealer if you have zits or pimples on your face. Use foundation if your complexion is uneven (pimples or bumps in areas that are hard to cover up).
 If you have a golden skin tone or dark skin, use a bronzer that is close to your skin tone or a blush that matches your skin.
 Don't put to much on there because then it will look like you rushed and put on to much.
 If you are applying a gloss, this will help it last longer, so that you aren't reapplying it every few minutes.
 If you have fair skin, try a light or peachy pink. If you have medium skin, a golden or coral gloss helps set off the golden undertones in your skin. If you have dark skin, a dark pink, clear, or light pink lipgloss will work best for you.
 Rub your lips together, and if it is too heavy or shiny, dab some off with a tissue.
