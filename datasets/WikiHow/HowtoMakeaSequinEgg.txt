 There are various options for creating a sequin egg, and what you choose will depend on what you've got in mind for theme and/or the materials available. Some ideas include:


Color: The easiest way to approach color is to keep it all the same color. Or, you could use two matching colors. A little more complicated but amazing to look at is to make a rainbow colored egg.
Pattern: Various pattern approaches include using small and large sequins, stripes, a motif such as a bunny or a letter or a cross.;
, Use pencil or marker. If you're adding sequins randomly, simply proceed without adding any design.
 Press the sequin against the blown-out egg (or plastic egg) and hold in place briefly to set.
 Cover the entire egg.
 This simple craft doesn't take a lot of effort before it's ready for display.
