 These are available at hardware stores. They have a spring steel which clamps onto the wall wherever a bit of brick juts out from the mortar.
 There needs to be a minimum of 1/8" mortar recess for you to be able to attach the brick hanger.
 Follow the packaging instructions for clamping it firmly in place.
 Hang the stocking on this part, using the loop. If it lacks a loop, add one either by gluing on a ribbon loop or sewing a loop in place.
 When you're finished with hanging stockings on the fireplace alcove, simply snap the brick hanger off the wall and place in safekeeping for use next holiday season.
