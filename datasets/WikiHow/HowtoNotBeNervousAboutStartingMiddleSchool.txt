 Students who have experienced middle school will remember what it was like to be nervous when they were starting middle school. They can help you, and give you tips they wish they would have known. Listening to someone tell you "It's okay, I have been there" will make you feel less nervous.;
, Don't think about the bad things that could happen because, then they could happen & get you more nervous.
 They know that it's your first time at middle school, and they will help you figure out where you need to go. They won't shout at you if you show up late because you couldn't find your classroom. Lots of kids do it. Remember that you can ask any teacher for directions.
 Think of the future.
 You're not the first person to be nervous or feel weird. You have your friends that might feel that way too, just share your feelings with some of your friends and compare your feelings with theirs. Chances are, they won't be too different.
 Just think of it as any other night you have to go to sleep early so you can get a good rest.
 Tons of preteens worry they will be late. Don't. Just have your things ready.
 You were probably just as worried are you are now. Now that you are done with elementary school, you know there was nothing to be worried about. Think to yourself "I CAN do this"! You have done it before, and now it's time to do it again. Think, you could be giving someone advice on how to not be nervous about starting middle school.
