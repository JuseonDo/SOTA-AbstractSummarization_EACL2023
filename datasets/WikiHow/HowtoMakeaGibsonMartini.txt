 This can be done by filling a cocktail glass with ice, but remove the ice before adding or straining the ingredients into the glass, as the drink is not served on the rocks.;
, The shaker should be filled about half to three-quarters full.
 To make a very dry Gibson martini see the options below.


To make a very dry Gibson martini a splash of vermouth can also first be added to the cocktail glass. Coat the inside of the glass with the vermouth by rotating the glass, then pour out and discard the vermouth before adding the vodka or gin from the shaker.
Instead of adding the vermouth to the glass when making a very dry Gibson martini, add the vermouth to the ice-filled cocktail shaker before adding the vodka, stir, then strain out and discard the vermouth before adding the gin or vodka.
To make a very dry Gibson martini without wasting vermouth, use a plastic pour spout with the bottle of vermouth. Hold you finger tightly over the pour spout outlet and let only a drop or two of vermouth drip through the air vent of the pour spout. Using this method, pour the vermouth into the shaker with the gin or vodka.
 Stir carefully and gradually so as not to overly agitate the ingredients or break the ice cubes.
