 The jar should have a wide opening.;
, You should be able to get one at a metal cutter or a hardware store.
 Mark the aluminum sheet for later trimming - it should completely cover the jar.
, You could search online and have it printed.
, Use the pattern as a guide in making your stars.


Use different sizes of needle or drill bit.
,, You can use a tea light or any LED device that you can fit into the jar. Do not use real candles. The aluminium will melt and you will end up getting a melted star display.Â ;)
