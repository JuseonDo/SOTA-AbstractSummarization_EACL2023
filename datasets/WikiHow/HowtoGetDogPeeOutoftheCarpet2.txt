 If so, soak it by putting a few rows of paper towels above the damp spot. Do this again as many times as you need to, until you have gotten all the urine.


Try locating the wet spots with a light that's black.
 Be sure to use the amount you need to find the fibers on the carpet. Use a brush that's used for scrubbing things, to succeed in getting to these fibers.
 Know that the urine's ammonia will be counteracted by the white vinegar.


If you have a vacuum (dry or damp), get rid of any extra dampness with it.
 Gather the detergent and hydrogen peroxide, and stir together. Try using Palmolive detergent (or something like that), and try not to use Cascade, or a detergent for washing dishes that's similar to that one.
, Once the wet spot has dried thoroughly, vacuum everything up.
