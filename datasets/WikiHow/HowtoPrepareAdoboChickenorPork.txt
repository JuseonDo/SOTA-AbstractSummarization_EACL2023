 Always wash your hands after handling raw meat.;
, Slice the onion in half lengthwise, then peel it.Placing the flat side of the onion on the chopping board, thinly slice the two halves.
 Peel 4 cloves of garlic, then use the flat end of your knife to crush all 4 cloves. Chop the cloves into very small pieces.
 Taste the sauce to see how much pepper you want to add.
 1 hour is all it needs to marinate, but if you are working on a time crunch, you can marinate for only 30 minutes. If you have a lot of time, you can marinate it overnight.
, Turn once as it simmers. Lower the heat if the sauce begins to boil.
 Carefully removing the sauté pan from the heat, pour the marinade sauce out of the pan and into a bowl. You can use the same bowl you marinated the meat in. Make sure the meat does not fall out as you pour the sauce.
 1 tablespoon of olive or canola oil will work. This will help the meat not stick.
 This will take 10-20 minutes. Use medium heat to brown the meat, but turn the heat higher if the meat is cooking very slowly.
 Carefully transfer the marinade sauce back to the sauté pan, then bring the pan to a boil.
 The chicken or pork should be tender and the sauce will be a thick, deep brown. The meat should be fully cooked throughout.
 Taste the marinade sauce and see if it needs more salt or pepper.
 You can use a rice cooker to prepare 2-3 cups of brown or white rice, depending on how many people you are feeding. 1 cup usually feeds 2 people.
