 If there is any residue, you can wash it off with some rubbing alcohol or white vinegar.;
, You could also measure down 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the base of the neck, make a mark, then use that mark as your cutting guide. Use a box cutter or craft blade to cut the bottle., Some plastic soda bottles have a molded line. If your bottle is one of those, you can use that line as a cutting guide.Otherwise, cut off 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) off of the bottom of your bottle.
 If you'd like, you can make the bottom smoother by pressing a hot iron against it for 15 to 20 seconds. Don't do this for the top hole, or the plastic bags may get caught.Use the highest setting on your iron.
 Your holder is almost complete, but you can make it look nicer (and less like a plastic bottle) by spray painting it or by covering it with scrapbooking paper.


Attach the scrapbooking paper with double-sided tape.
 This is now the top of your plastic bag holder. Alternatively, you can also punch just one hole, thread a short piece of ribbon through it, then tie the ribbon into a loop.
 Pull the plastic bags out from the smaller hole at the bottom.
 Pull the plastic bags out, one at a time, from the bottom hole. Refill the bag by stuffing more plastic bags through the top hole.
