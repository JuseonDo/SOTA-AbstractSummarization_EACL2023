To scale in Photoshop, load your image up into a new document.
Click "File" and scroll down to "Print".
Look for the option that says "Scale to Fit Media" and click that.
Print it out.
To scale in Microsoft Word, drag and drop the picture into the document.
Click "Format Picture", then "Wrap Text".
Click "Place Behind Text".
When you've made it into the size you want, print it out.
To scale in Microsoft Paint, open the picture up on Paint.
Expand to your desired size.
Print it out.
 When cutting, try to be as neat as possible and remember to cut out the tabs. You need them for folding.
,, Make sure to use the tabs to glue the sides! If you have separate parts to the model, fold them first and then stack them, making sure to glue them to each other.


Show them off to your friends and family and who knows, you might even start a business selling ornate PaperCraft models.
