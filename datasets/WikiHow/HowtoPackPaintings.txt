, This will protect the paintings and keep the glass in place in case it breaks or cracks when the paintings are moved.
 This could be part of a box that you are not using. The cardboard should be large enough to cover the glass, but not bigger than the entire painting.


Use mat board, foam or even loose carpet padding if you do not have any cardboard. The purpose is to reduce the amount of static cling that can develop between the bubble wrap and the painting.
 Depending on the shape of the paintings, you can wrap horizontally or vertically, or both, whichever keeps the paintings more secure.


Secure the edges of the bubble wrap with masking tape, at the back of the paintings. The paintings should feel tightly wrapped and secure once you are done.
 Most moving and shipping companies sell mirror and art boxes.


Get boxes that are a bit larger than the paintings you will be packing. You will need to factor in the room that bubble wrap and other packing materials might take.
 If there is extra space inside the box, stuff newspaper, rags or other filling into the box so the painting has little room to move.
 If it can, fill the box with more packing material.
,, This type of box is actually 2 boxes that fit inside each other. They work well for paintings that are larger than 30 inches by 36 inches (76 cm by 91 cm).


Fill the spaces between the telescope boxes with wadded newspaper, bubble wrap or other packing materials.
