 n is number of moles, m is mass in grams, and M is molar mass in grams per mole. To calculate M, add up all the molar mass of the elements present in the compound found on the periodic table of elements.


n = m / M = 500g / 55.85g/mol = 8.95mol

, To do this, use g * (R / G), where g is the previously calculated moles, R is the coefficient for the required mass, and G is the coefficient for the given mass.


g * (R / G) = 8.95mol * (2 / 4) = 4.48mol

, Once again, use the formula n = m / M.


n = m / M -> 4.48mol = m / 159.70g/mol = 715g
