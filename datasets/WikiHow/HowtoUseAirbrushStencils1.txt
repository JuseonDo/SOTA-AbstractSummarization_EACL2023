Cut a short piece of cheap masking tape and hold it by either end. Gently press it down on your shirt or another clean surface to thin out some of the adhesive.
Tear off a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5.1 cm) pieces off the tape and attach the ends to make loops with the adhesive side up.
Place the loops on the underside of the stencil.
Press the stencil gently onto the fabric.;

The stencil should have a wide enough border that you can ink the negative space without leaving any “blow by,” or ink outside the stencil.


Try to lift it straight off without dragging it from side to side to avoid smudges.
