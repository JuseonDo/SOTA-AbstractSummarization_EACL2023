The only way to hide your amount of Facebook friends is to hide your entire friends list.;
, It’s the small version of your profile photo (next to your first name) at the top-center part of the screen.
 It’s beneath your cover photo and profile name. This will open a list of all of your Facebook friends.
 It’s at the top-right corner of the “Friends” area.
 A pop-up will appear.
 It’s the first drop-down menu on the page.
 Your friends list (and the amount of people on it) is now only visible to you.
