 The length should be long enough to loosely and comfortably wrap around your wrist.Make sure you leave extra length to tie into knots.
 Place the safety pins at equal intervals across the string. As each pin is placed, secure it by tying an overhand knot before placing the next pin.
 Open each safety pin individually. Slide a variety of beads and charms onto the pins.
 As you finish adding beads and charms to each safety pin, close it to prevent them from sliding off the pin.
 Wrap the bracelet around you wrist and tie the two ends together.
