,pull the wire out of the center of the distributor with a rubber handled pair of pliers, and hold it about 1/4" from the metal clips that holds the distributor cap on.

@summary
have someone crank over the engine.

@summary
use an ohmmeter to test the coil

@summary
remove all the wires taken off the terminals of the coil attach the positive and negative, red and black, wires of the meter to first the terminal 15 (positive) and 1 (negative) that are stamped on the coil.

There should be a nice blue spark that goes from the end of the wire you pulled out of the center of the cap to the metal clip.

It should look and sound strong, and should be easy to see, even in daylight.


If the spark looks thin and weak (yellow is weak, blue is strong), then the coil winding may be giving out.


A reading of at least 3 - 4.5 ohms, indicates a good coil.
A bad coil will show a higher reading then 3 - 4.5 ohms.


Place the red or black lead from the meter to the center of the coil (secondary post), and to either one of the terminals, 1 or 15 on the coil.

A reading of 9,500 - 10,000 Ohms, sometimes less, indicates a good coil.
A reading of 11,000 Ohms or more, or a reading of zero indicates a bad coil.
