 You can use a dull knife inserted into the joint to make removal easier. Sometimes a little meat will come out with the leg. Eat it.
 (You will get to them in a minute.)








, Open the apron––the apron looks like a tab.
 Pull off the top shell. Take care and do this slowly. Toss the top shell.









You will have cleaned out the crab and have removed the gills to show the shell.










Now take one of the halves and with a knife (or your hands) cut it in half.
If you are using your hands, press down to break the chambers and then pull apart.
Now you should have the meat exposed. Use your fingers to pull the meat out and enjoy! Use your knife to get the meat out of the smaller chambers.
 Start with the claws.
 The most efficient way to open a claw:









Lay your knife, sharp side down, on the middle of the red side of the claw.
Then use the crab mallet to gently hit the knife, until the knife is halfway through the claw.
Finally, pivot the knife to the side. That will open the claw and make it easier to eat. Then snap the shell open and eat the meat, avoiding the cartilage.
