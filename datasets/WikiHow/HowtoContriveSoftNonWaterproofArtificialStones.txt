unless you have access to powdered chalk, you would probably need to grind your own chalk.

@summary
top up the chalk with baby powder to an amount desired, while trying to keep the ratio of chalk to baby powder roughly around 2:3.

@summary
pinch off a ball of paper clay approximately a sixth of the chalk-baby powder mix.

@summary
dissolve the desired colour acrylic paint into the slip thoroughly.

@summary
mix the chalk and baby powder with a portion of the coloured slip you have.

@summary
mould the mixture to the desired shape and set it to dry in a warm place.

@summary
shape the rock by chiseling, grinding etc.

@summary
,

@summary
polish the stone if desired by rubbing it onto paper.

@summary
you can also paint the finished rock to look like granite by applying a series of light misting layers of paint in complimentary colors.

 Using any flat object with a suitably sharp edge (such as a metal ruler), rub the chalk across the edge to produce a fine grained powder. Break a piece of chalk off and cleave it into small pieces.;
, More chalk would make the resultant rock harder and brittle, while more baby powder would make the rock softer.
 Convert it to slip by dissolving it in water. Now you should have obtained a thick milky white liquid.
 Remember that the colour of the stone would lighten dramatically when dry.
 Knead the mixture. If the mixture is crumbly, add more slip. If its too watery, leave the mixture to dry for some time.
 Avoid direct sunlight and extreme heat as it would cause the mixture to crack.
, Initially, the rock would be worn downed and powder would be produced. However, as time passes, the powder would be compacted into the paper's pores to form a smooth, shiny surface. At around the same time, the rock's surface would start to darken and shine too.
 Ideally you will water down the paint with water at a ratio of three parts water to one part pain and apply the mixture with a spray bottle. Light layers of different colors with time to dry between each layer will create an exact likeness to real granite.
