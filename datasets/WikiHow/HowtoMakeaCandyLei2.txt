 The candy that works best for this method are candies that are wrapped in cellophane, with the ends twisted shut. Great examples include Werthers, Jolly Ranchers, and saltwater taffy.
 You can use just one color or lots of colors. If this is for a graduation ceremony, you could even use the school's colors. You will need one piece of ribbon for each candy., Place a piece of ribbon behind the wrapper, right between the candy and the twisted part. Make sure that the ribbon is centered, then pull the ends of the ribbon towards you and tie it into a tight, double-knot.
 Don't worry if the ribbon pieces look too long. You can always cut them down later.
 The color of the ribbon does not matter, because it will be covered by candy in the end. It might be a good idea to use a color that matches your candy, however, in case there are any gaps., Alternate the sides you tie the candy onto, and gently scrunch the candy together every so often. This will give you an extra-full lei.Leave about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) at each end of the ribbon so that you can tie it together. How full your lei turns out depends on how much candy you add.


Consider tying a knot at the end of your 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide ribbon to keep the candy from sliding down while you work.
 Be sure to use a tight, double-knot, and that there are no gaps between the knot and the candy.
 You can leave the curling ribbon as they are, or you can trim them down. You can also curl them slightly by running them between your thumb and a pair of scissors.
