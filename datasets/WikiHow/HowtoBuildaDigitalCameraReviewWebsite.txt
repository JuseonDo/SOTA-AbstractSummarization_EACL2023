@summary

@article
 Sure you can spend a little if you want but then things get a little more complicated so we will keep things nice and simple to start with.;
,,, Bear in mind the obvious names will probably already have been chosen so try to think creatively. For example "digitalcamerareviews" was already chosen when I filled out the form but "mydigitalcameraviews" was available.
 Go ahead and do this.
, Click on the back button in your web browser to go back to where you clicked on the "View your site" link. Next to it there is another link which says "Login". Click on this link and you know have a wordpress login page. Go ahead and fill in your username and password ( you created these earlier when you created your account ).
 On this page you can add content, change the design, moderate comments and reviews, check stats for your new website, in fact pretty much anything. Go ahead and have a look around.
 Scroll down the left column to "Appearance". There are about 80 different designs to choose from.
 This will then show up on your website. Don't worry you can delete it later on your dashboard. You can also add links to other websites too. And don't forget to add Categories so it will be easier to find reviews once you have added a few. You could categorize by brand i.e. Nikon, Canon, Olympus etc. or SLR, Digital etc. it's up to you.
