,, Don't go too fast: keep it nice and steady so your Mii doesn't fall. Stay right behind the runner in front of you. If you pass him, you will then follow the dog. Remember, it isn't about winning the race, it's about improving your health and having fun!

, Have fun with it!

, Just jog at your own pace.
 If you have "Free Jogging", do it every day for 10 minutes.
