 Scrub it well.;
, Use caution when cutting the ginger. Peeling is optional, if you have washed it well.
, Put the lid on the teapot to stop the pot from cooling down too quickly and to keep the aromatic ingredients in the tea. Steep for 10 - 15 minutes.






If you boil the water in a saucepan rather than in a kettle, you can add the ginger to the saucepan and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes. After simmering let it sit for 5 minutes before pouring.






Use a tea ball to hold the sliced ginger and steep in a cup for 15 minutes. Make sure to use a saucer to cover the top of the cup to prevent the aromatic elements from escaping.
 Add sweeteners or flavour if desired.
