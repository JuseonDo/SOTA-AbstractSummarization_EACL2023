 Most of his clothes can be found anywhere. He mainly wears simple clothing such as long sleeve shirts, half button shirts, khaki's, or solid colour pants, and his signature purple and black fur trench coat. You can buy the coat online or you can make it yourself. Look at pictures of Soubi for reference. If you're not keen on sewing, you can always ask a family member or friend who is proficient in the skill to make it for you.;
, Soubi's hair isn't really a challenge to achieve unlike most anime/manga characters. If you already have long dusty blonde hair then you're all set! If not, you can choose either to bleach it dusty blonde or buy a wig.
, If you don't have so already, opt for a pair of blue contacts.
,,,,, Also, tell them "I love you" frequently since Soubi incessantly keeps telling Ritsuka he loves him.
,,, Soubi tends to lie to Ritsuka a lot, even though he says he'll tell him anything. Try not to be a good promise keeper.
 Try not to talk so much and instead, be a listener rather than a chatter. He only speaks when the moment is necessary.
 Either they have to be younger or the same age since he said himself that he doesn't date older women, even though she was only three years older than him.
 He's the one who stole Soubi's ears and severely abused him before he got with Seimei.
