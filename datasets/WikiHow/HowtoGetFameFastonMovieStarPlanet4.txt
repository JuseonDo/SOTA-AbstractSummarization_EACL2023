 There used to be these 'bubbly circles' beside your user; now there is an activities icon at the top and also one with an Oscar on it and some scissors click that one. For every task you do, you earn fame and 100 starcoins.
 It's found at the top left corner. Click Rooms. Go to all of the rooms that have pets. Love the pets to earn money. If you do this daily, you'll have over 2,000 star coins in one week of doing this.
,, Then buy a boonie to get fame.
 You can get up to 10000 fame!
