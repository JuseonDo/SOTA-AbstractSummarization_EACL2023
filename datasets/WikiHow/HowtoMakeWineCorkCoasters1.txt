 Each halve should now have a flat and a rounded side.;
, Just as you did in step one, continue to slice three more corks in half so that each has a rounded and flat side.You should have a total of eight cork pieces.
, Place the piece of cork directly in contact with the previous piece, lining up the edge of the cork with the edge of the felt or cork board. The two pieces should be directly in contact, parallel, and aligned with the edge of the felt.


The pieces of cork should now be arranged in a square.
 These two pieces of cork should lay perpendicular to the pieces that you already arranged on the felt or cork board.Be sure that the edge of the cork piece is lined up to the edge of the felt or cork board, inline with the previous pieces.
 Place two additional pieces of cork on the felt, just above the the very first "cork square" that you made. Be sure to line up the edge of the cork with the felt or cork board, and that you lay them perpendicularly to the original cork square.
 Just as you did with the previous three cork squares, lay these final pieces of cork down so that they are perpendicular to the adjacent cork squares.


Once you are happy with the arrangement, you can go ahead and begin adhering the corks together to form a coaster.
Try experimenting with different sizes, shapes and patterns.
 Being careful not to disturb the other pieces, lift one of the pieces of cork from the felt or cork board and apply glue to its flat bottom.Begin with one of the pieces of cork that is along the edge of the felt or cork board. This will help you maintain a straight edge.
 Now that you have applied hot glue to the bottom of the cork, all you need to do is place it back down on the felt in its original position.
, Once the hot glue has dried you can trim the excess. Using a pair of sharp scissors, cut along the edge of the corks and remove any excess felt or cork board.
