exercise on purpose.

@summary
read how this works as explained by dr. tim church, pennington research center, baton rouge, la.

@summary
realize the regular recommendation is to gradually work up to 150 minutes a week (21+ minutes per day) of exercise — and this did not change, yet recent studies indicate that results are apparent in half that time.

avoid perfectionism, ie: all-or-nothing thinking:

@summary
like "i can’t run fast for 4 minutes, or jog for an hour, so why even try?",

@summary
reshape your thinking and shape-up your health: as dr. church suggests that your walking a few minutes a day: “... will reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, anxiety, depression, diabetes, and many other conditions.”

@article
 Do at least a little moderate exercise everyday. This study suggests 70 minutes a week (10 minutes a day) of added exercise can lessen your dangers of blood, heart and arterial diseases and improve your quality of life.
; he said


“Our bodies respond very positively to even small amounts of physical activity,”
“For sedentary individuals, the immediate health benefits are huge. In fact, those who have been doing nothing stand to benefit the most from increasing physical activity in terms of dying prematurely.”
Sedentary individuals (who seldom get exercise) may benefit by increasing daily exercise by several minutes.



Dr. Church also says of the study: “We saw a change in waist size, which is associated with the most dangerous form of abdominal fat, in just 70 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike.”

, and
like you may underestimate the positive effects of less-intense exercise.
like equating weight loss with fitness and despair if the scale doesn’t change much.
