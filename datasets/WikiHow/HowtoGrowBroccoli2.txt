 Usually this will take about six weeks. The height and plant development are more important than the duration of the germination process.
 Make sure you have completed the proper soil preparation methods outlined above before transplanting your seedlings, including fertilizing the soil.
 Position plants to the same depth they were in pots/containers. Miniature varieties can be planted as close as one foot apart.
 For summer plantings, apply an organic mulch of compost, leaves, or bark to keep soil cool. For winter plantings, apply a black plastic covering to heat the soil.,
