,

@summary
set your multimeter to its resistance setting.

@summary
connect the multimeter leads to the capacitor terminals.

@summary
observe the multimeter reading.

@summary
disconnect and reconnect the capacitor several times.

, This setting may be marked with the word “OHM” (the unit for resistance) or the Greek letter omega (Ω), the abbreviation for ohm.


If your unit has an adjustable resistance range, set the range to 1000 ohm = 1K or higher.
 Again, connect the red lead to the positive (longer) terminal and the black lead to the negative (shorter) terminal.
 Write down the initial resistance value, if you wish. The value should soon revert to what it was before you connected the leads.
 You should see the same results as on the first test. If you do, the capacitor is good.


If, however, the resistance value does not change on any of the tests, the capacitor is dead.
