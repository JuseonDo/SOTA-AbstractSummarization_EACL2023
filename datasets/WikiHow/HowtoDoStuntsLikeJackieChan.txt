 Jackie trained vigorously from a young age. All of these skills will help with your balance, coordination, and reflexes, all of which help Jackie achieve his stunts.;
, What is the stunt that you want to pull off? Is it a Jackie Chan stunt, or is it one of your own? Make sure that you will not get hurt in any way possible.
 How will you start? How will you finish? Those questions will be answered as soon as the stunt begins.
 You might have to take gymnastics class and practice walking on balance beams, flips, and bars. Go to a fitness camp. Any way that you can get prepared for the stunt.
