 This will ensure the hair is easy to work with and will dry in the braids, the secret to their staying power.;
,, A half dollar sized dollop of each leave in and gel should do the trick. Disperse throughout hair evenly, focusing on the lower hair shaft.
 Two braids is sufficient, but for tighter or more plentiful curls, do more. Experiment with different kinds of braids, such as normal, fishtail, french, rope, etc. Different styles will net different curl patterns and may work better for your hair type than others.
, If they're not, blow dry the braids until they are completely dry.
 If you see fit, straighten your bangs and the ends of your hair with the braids still in.
 Pat dry and wait until they air dry from it.
