sony has released a patch in response to criticism.
@article
 This way the software cannot be automatically loaded onto your computer when you insert a Sony DRM enabled audio disc or application.;
, Accepting this long document in legalese effectively means you give permission for Sony to install software on your computer. Don't.
 Since these discs are designed to intentionally hide files from Windows, you may need specialized ripping software. Ripping programs such as Exact Audio Copy (see external links) can read these files if you have turned off autorun and disabled the spyware install.
, In theory, the patch removes the cloaking-rootkit aspects of their software, though leaves the DRM (which prevents copying the music) in place but now unhidden. See Warnings for concerns regarding the patch, and External Links (below) to download it if you choose.
