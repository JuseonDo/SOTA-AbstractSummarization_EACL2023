 A quiet/unbalanced mix will be difficult to make loud;
, Using multiple stages of processing can result in more natural results that will allow you to get a louder master. These are explained below.
 This applies gain reduction to the very low levels as well as the peaks.



Multiband compression can be used to treat the frequency bands separately and give a more natural result. Try experimenting to see what works best with this process, and make sure to practise, practise, practise!
Parallel compression is a great way to bring the levels up without affecting the transients. This means you can get louder without it sounding as squashed.



Limiting is a process that is usually overdone. Try experimenting with release settings to minimise 'pumping' and try not to overdo this process.
Saturation/excitation/distortion. Used in small amounts these processes can achieve louder sounds. They are a little more friendly towards transients than compression but can make a mix sound harsh if overdone.
Clipping. This is something that's usually taught to be avoided (and for good reason) however, used in small amounts (usually just around half a db) this can get you just a little more gain than you would have got otherwise.
 Using a combination of the above, learning how they interact with each other and practising will take you a long way in getting louder, better sounding masters. Good luck!
