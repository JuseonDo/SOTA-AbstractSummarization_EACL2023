put your vest in the freezer.

@summary
remove the vest, and use a plastic scraper to scrape as much of the resinous material as possible off the vest.

@summary
use a vacuum, if available, to suction the resin from the fiber, otherwise, brush it off lightly with a soft paint brush, or even a toothbrush.

,

@summary
crease the area where the sap is embedded, making sure it is still very hard from the freezer.

@summary
use a solvent or soap as a last resort, only after scraping and working all of the sap out that you can manually.

@summary
use the above products to loosen and dissolve the sap, then blot the residue out with a damp towel.

@summary
do not continue if these steps do not work.

 Lay it in a position where the pine sap (or other sticky sap or substance) will not get pushed deeper into the fabric.;
, While it is very cold, the resin should crumble, or turn to a powder, but when it warms, it will quickly become sticky again, so put some cardboard or newspapers down to catch it.
, Work the creasing motion back and forth over the area, working more of the material loose.
 Once the solvent has dissolved the remaining resin, it will be likely to spread and go deeper into the nylon fibers. The following solvents may remove a significant amount of the tree sap, and if you are careful not to use too much, it shouldn't damage the nylon, or the down inside it.


Grease cutting dish detergent like Dawn. Dab a drop on, full strength, then dab off with a paper towel.
Gojo or a similar mechanic's hand cleaner. These products use lanolin, orange oil, and mild degreasers, which should break down the sap.
Denatured alcohol. This will break down the sap, but you will have to allow it to soak, keeping just the area that is affected damp, but not wet.
 Change the towel after it has absorbed the sap and solvent, to keep from returning it to the fabric.
 Take the vest to a dry cleaner, and pay the price for your mistake, rather than ruining the vest.
