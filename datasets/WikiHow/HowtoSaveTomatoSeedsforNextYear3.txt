 Discard these, as you won't be able to use them to grow a tomato plant.
 The water should be room temperature.
 Use a spoon or other stirring implement that's long enough to get to the bottom of the container.
 Put a covering over your container when you pour off the water so that you don’t lose any seeds.
 Rinse them under running water, but make sure the holes in the strainer aren't so big that the seeds can slip out.
 Avoid using other kinds of plates, as the seeds tend to stick together when placed on non-paper surfaces.



Shake or stir the seeds periodically so that all the surfaces of the seeds are exposed to the air. They are completely dry if they slide off the plate easily and don’t stick to each other.
 Label the jar with the name of the seed variety and the date.
