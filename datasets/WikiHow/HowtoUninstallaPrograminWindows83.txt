 If you prefer to use the Command Prompt to perform tasks, or your computer is malfunctioning and you only have access to Safe Mode, you can use Command Prompt to completely uninstall desktop programs.


If you're in Windows, press the Windows key + X and select "Command Prompt (Admin)".
If Windows isn't working correctly, boot into the Advanced Startup menu and select "Command Prompt" from the "Troubleshoot" â†’ "Advanced options" menu.
 This will start the utility that allows you to manage your programs.
 This will display a list of your installed programs. The list may take a moment to load if you have a lot of programs installed.


If the list is longer than the screen can display, you can scroll up to see all of the entries.
 You will need to type it exactly, including any capitalization.
 You will be prompted to confirm that you want to remove the program. Type y and press Enter to confirm.
 This will indicate that the program has been successfully removed.
