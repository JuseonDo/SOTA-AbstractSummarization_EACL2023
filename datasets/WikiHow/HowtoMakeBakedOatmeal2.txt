, You can use paper or foil liners. This will make it easier to remove the oatmeal cups later on.
 Keep mixing until the yolks break. You can use a fork or whisk for this.
 Keep stirring until the brown sugar dissolves. There should be no streaks or swirls of egg yolk.
 If you don't like apple sauce, you can add un half of a sliced up banana instead., At this point, try to use a "rolling" motion, so that you are bringing all of the ingredients from the bottom of the bowl to the top. This will help ensure that everything mixes in together evenly. When you are done, there should be no streak or swirls.
 If you'd like, you can add some toppings, such as raisins, peeled and chopped apples, berries, or ground cinnamon. Use a spoon to press the toppings into the oatmeal., The oatmeal should be firm and golden on top.
