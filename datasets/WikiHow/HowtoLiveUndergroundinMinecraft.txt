 Will it be a basement, a house, or an escape route?;
, If you are playing in a Minecraft server, you may want to block off the surface entrance and set your home underground in the base. This will lessen your chances of being griefed.
 You can craft them by combining coal and wood. If you prefer charcoal, see Get Charcoal Instead of Coal in Minecraft. For mining coal and other things such as diamonds, see How To Mine in Minecraft. If you don't have a crafting table, this is how to make one.


Punch a tree. Then collect the wood.
Open your inventory and make wooden planks from the wood.
Make as many wooden planks as you need for the craft table(s).
 You should craft a bed (optional). If this is your basement or escape route, it is still helpful to have your bed here because the Mobs are less likely to find you. See Craft a Bed in Minecraft for more info.
 Add a furnace, which is made of cobblestone, and an extra crafting table.
