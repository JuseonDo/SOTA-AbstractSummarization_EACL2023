 If you're not consistent, the batter may "blob" up together while frying and you'll end up with a ball. When using a measuring cup, it's helpful if it has a sprout so that the batter will stream better.
 Pour the batter into a gallon or freezer plastic baggie. Remove all of the air and seal the bag. Use scissors to snip about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) off from one of the corners. Carefully squeeze the batter into the hot oil., Wash and rinse them out and re-use them for other uses or projects. Anything that you can easily squeeze batter through is efficient, so you may need to cut tips in order to create bigger holes., You can also look into and invest in your own fryer to make funnel cakes and all sorts of different fried desserts.
