@article
, Fill at least 1/4 of the vase with clean water, and put in some blue flower dye into the water., Skim the thorns off, taking care not to skim the stem. Then, cut the roots off, leaving a nice green stem. Place the roses in the water., This time is needed to allow the dye to sink in. Cut the very bottom one last time. Place aside and tip all of the blue water down the drain, then fill with clean water., Enjoy your very own blue roses!
