 You can do this by unlocking your device and clicking Settings on the front page. You then tap on General and go to About. Scroll down until you find version and beside it, the number of the version that you own. If it is 4.2.1 then the following instructions will work for your iPod.;
, Click on the downloads tab at the top of the page and scroll down a bit; you will find "Jail Firmware 4.2.1" and right underneath that there will be two choices. You will click the second one that says "greenpois0n RC6.1 (win)" and install it.
 Click Greenpois0n and then ANOTHER box will come up that says "Prepare to Jailbreak." Click that but first make sure you have your iPod already plugged into the USB of your computer.
 It will say "Get Ready to Start," "Hold down on sleep button," "Continue to hold down on sleep button but hold down on home button as well," and "Release sleep button but continue to hold down on home button." If you followed the directions successfully then a button underneath will say "Jailbreak" and you can click that.
 Wait for this to finish and then after the Apple symbol should appear, proceeded by the jailbreak sign, which is a picture of a skull.
 This is where you go to download Installous, which is where you can get your apps from.
 Tap Sources. At the top right, tap Edit. At the top left, tap Add. In the box, write http://cydia.hackulo.us/ After, you tap Add Source. Let it load, and the under the Entered by User section, click the link that says Hackulo.us. Scroll down until you see Installous, which is where you can get all of the good apps.
, If you see an app you would like to get, then just open it up and click Download. From here there will be a bunch of links, and usually the very first one works, but if it doesn't scroll down to the last one and see if that works. If a new page opens, then you know it is working. Click "Start Download" and from there you should know what to do.
