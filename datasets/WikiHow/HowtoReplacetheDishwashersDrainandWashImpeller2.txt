 Use a #15 Torx driver on those screws. The spray tower is held with a friction fit from the rubber from the tower. Pull that out and set it aside.
 There is a hex shape nut on top of the impeller and that’s molded into it. Hold the impeller with the wrench and remove the screw.
 Use the #21 Torx driver and remove these screws. Lift the filter housing out of the dishwasher and set it aside.



Note: Water may be left in the housing, so use a towel or sponge to dry it up.
 Next, with the #15 Torx driver, remove this one screw that connects to the drain impeller and set it aside.
