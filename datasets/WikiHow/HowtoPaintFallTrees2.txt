 If you get paper that is too thin, the colors will bleed through. If you get a paper that is too thick, the colors will run off. You needs something that's just right.
 Don't use anything that will damage the paper.
 You can use acrylics that you have diluted withÂ water, or normal watercolors for creating your tree. Preferred colors are red, orange, yellow, or brown.
 Use a paper plate, once again, to pour your colors onto and mix with. The wider, the better.
 Drag your sponge or brush gently downwards to avoid getting too much paint on the paper. If you put too much on there, hold up the paper and allow the paint to run off.
 Start at the top and blot the colors on it. This will create an effect that is close to crisp, rustling leaves on your tree.
 Allow time to dry.
