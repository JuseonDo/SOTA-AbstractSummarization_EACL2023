@summary
understand how the smoke-burner stove works based on the design of the combustion chamber (its dimensions, primary and secondary air holes, and either air pumped with a fan or using natural draft without a fan).

@summary
smoke: there is a chance that your stove might sometimes generate too much smoke, for the following reasons

@summary
chips of wood or shavings are wet.

@summary
kitchen environment: always use a well-ventilated kitchen or semi-ventilated or fully open areas.

@summary
outdoors: shield the stove from the wind using a windscreen.

@summary
,

@summary
fill correctly with your chosen fuel: there should be contiguity between pieces of fuel (no voids, but not packed too tightly -- there should be chance for flow of primary air).

@summary
lighting the fuel: use small pieces of wood shavings soaked (not too much) in any mild fire oil (kerosene / diesel / vegetable oil / etc.).

@summary
multigrade fuel: if using multigrade fuel, sort/sieve it and could classify it into two grades for use.

@summary
if a pot skirt is available, use it.

@summary
kill the fire, when the cooking is done, if the stove will be unattended, empty the remaining fuel and charcoal into a tub of water or into an air-tight fire and heat-proof container to prevent burns, smoke, and carbon monoxide poisoning.

If the stove uses a fan, then it is called a Forced-Air TLUD (Top lit Updraft)
If the stove uses only gravity air pressure, it is called a Natural Draft TLUD.
Follow the instructions provided for each model.;
,

A good water content ranges from only 10-12%.


Excess carbon (in the smoke) 30-40% of stoichiometric air (4.7kg air/kg biomass)
Insufficient air from the primary air source - blocked by the biomass material, or material packed too tightly, or biomass of different sizes (big and small pieces mixed), etc.
 If exhaust fans are available, keep them on during and after cooking until all the charcoal have turned cold or turned to ash.
, Homogeneous size of biomass pieces / shavings, Avoid wet biomass and bark of certain trees in the biomass.
 Spread a layer of it evenly on the top of the fuel charge, light using a matchstick / lighter, then place the bowl / container for cooking, and switch on the fan.
 Say 1 inch (2.5Â cm) size fuel / 2-inch size fuel, etc.


If you want to use two grades of fuel simultaneously use the large size grade at the bottom and then the small size fuel at the top, see that this small size fuel simply does not slip downwards while burning. If it is true wood gas stove, the char-mass produced will have some brittleness / stiffness and the finer biomass will not move downwards. In quasi-wood gas stove the small size fuel might get too much air and be converted into ash from embers that might move downwards generating some amount of excess smoke, which is unexpected.
 It will improve the efficiency of the stove between 20% to 50%.



Avoiding steam injury: dump it into a "large quantity of COLD water". If you dump into hot water or a small quantity of cold water, a dangerous amount of hot steam may be produced which could cause severe burns to your hands or arms.
