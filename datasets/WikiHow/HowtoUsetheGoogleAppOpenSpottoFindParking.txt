@summary
be aware that the time limitation means that there is the potential for a spot to be taken before you get to it.

 The app is pretty simple; it pulls up a Google map near your current location and displays open parking spots within a 1.4 km/0.9 mile radius of where you are. Spots are color coded based on how “fresh” they are. Spots are marked for twenty minutes and after that time, they disappear off the map.;
,, Even if a spot is marked as “fresh” (within five minutes), that might not mean the spot is available. If there was a way for users to confirm that they have “taken” a spot in the system, the process might be better.
 For instance, if you’re one of the only people in your neighborhood who uses the app, it will likely be useless to you unless you can convince others to join in.
