color the drawings and then you have just made 3 comical manga expressions!

@article
 Since you'll be making 3 expressions, just copy 2 more.;
,,,

The first expression will be the wacky anger. Draw the eyes as long ovals with sketchy and thick lines. The eyebrows should just be diagonal sketchy and thin lines. Add 4 curved lines at the top of the head forming a cross. and use a quarter circle for the mouth.






Next up is the perky expression. Draw 2 curved lines below the hairline for the eyebrows. Then draw an oval with 2 curved lines above and beneath it for the left eye and a just a curved line for the right eye. Draw the mouth with a big wide smile.






Last but not least is the expression of having an unpleasant surprise or dread. Draw the eyes as drooping semi circles with the right eye having several vertical lines. The mouth should be made using a rectangle going over the chin or the "jaw drop" as they call.
