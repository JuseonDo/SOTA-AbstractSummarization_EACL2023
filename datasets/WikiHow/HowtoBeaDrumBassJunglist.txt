learn the basics of rhythm and melody.learn how to count bars.practice by listening to your favorite records and counting the bars.make slash marks for the bars--put longer slashes between the phrases and make notes about what is going on in the song (basic beat, drum fills, bass line comes in/out, melody comes in/out, beat drops out of song).

@summary
adjust the records using pitch adjust so they are the same bpms.

@summary
learn the two records' beats perfectly match, you can switch between the two records as fast or as slow as you want, as long as the phrases match up in a logical way.you can even start the records at different points in a phrase to get really technical and funky.

@summary
master this technique, then you are ready to use melody to master the art.this is where music theory comes into play.you have to figure out the key of the songs and mix them harmonically.

@summary
pitch up or slow down a song a lot and it changes the key of the song also.

@summary
learn how to spend the time to find the bomb records nobody else will be playing and make time to practice before you preach in the club.

@summary
work on your mic skills and learn how to yell "shiz nizzle with the fizz dizzle".

@summary
between rewinds remember to "big up" as many people as can be thought of.

 6.Listen closely and you will notice that bars are grouped in phrases that are usually 8, 16 or 32 bars. The notes that you make will help you learn the records. Your goal at first is to match phrases at the end of a particular record to the phrases at the beginning of another record.;
, Let the record 1 play through the speakers.Then cue up the record 2 in the earphones and search for the first good beat of the record. Wait for the one beat at the beginning of a new phrase on the record 1 and drop the one beat at the beginning of a phrase on the record 2 at the same time.Then you will be using pitch control on the same record to speed up and slow down record 2 until it is at the same bpm as the record 1. If necessary, pick up the needle on the record 2 and start over until the beats match.
 Not all these wacky phrase jumblings will work all the time. Use the notes you took while listening to the records and fit the song phrases together like a puzzle.
 Push any two keys on a keyboard, there is a certain feeling that the two notes give which is based on the interval of the notes to one another. You can use this to build or release tension in your set if you know what you are doing. You can mess around with your records and practice without knowing what you are doing, but it helps to look at the art like real musicians and learn theory.
 This is why sometimes you match 2 records together and the melodies and basslines match great, but when you try to do it later, when the pitches are different from where they were the first time you mixed the records, they will not sound matched.
 Learn to have fun and not care about learning more, otherwise you will be like most of the DJ that quit when they can't beatmatch like the professionals. Remember that people like the music, and if you are playing the jams, nobody will remember the one or two mess ups of the night.
 If the crowd is yelling "rewind, rewind," stop the record and play the jam you found once more. Also, remember that shouting "deal with the matter" at gurning little speedfreaks like blitzkrieg is like the staple diet of MC phrases.
