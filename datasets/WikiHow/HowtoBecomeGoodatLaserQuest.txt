 Remember that practice makes perfect. Get used to the pack that you have to wear and know how to play and know the rules, there's nothing more embarrassing than you being chucked out of a friend's party or tournament.
 Call the different parts by their correct name, don't call the sensors 'flashing lights'.

If you are going to play in a tournament, research some of the Laser Quest champs and know their tactics.
 If you spend all of the game at Laser Quest trying to figure out how to get around the arena, then you're not going to get many points.

Ask the marshal beforehand if you can look around the arena in a tournament.
 If you play regularly, you'll soon know which packs work better than others.

To know if your pack has a low battery, look at the screen on the back of your gun where your name comes up. If it's got a dim screen, it could mean it's low on battery.
 If they are camping in one spot, try to tag them until they leave so you can claim the best spot.,, It is a lot harder for your opponents to tag your front, back or one of your shoulder sensors if you are standing sideways., If you are constantly tagging someone and they are only getting a few tags on you then it's more likely that you will hit them first.,, For example some packs may have weak shoulders. If this is the case try to tag their shoulders instead of their other sensors., Make sure you don't tag walls or anything for no reason.,, You won't be in trouble because you haven't broken it. Most packs are prone to breaking.,, It allows you to get a few bonuses and discounts.
