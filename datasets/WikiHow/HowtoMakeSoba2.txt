 Add a generous tablespoon of salt to the water and wait until you have a rolling boil. Soba noodles only need about a minute to cook, so be ready to act once the water is hot enough., You need to flash chill the noodles as soon as they come out of the water, which stops cooking instantly and results in your silky, perfect texture., Being fresh, these noodles hardly take any time at all to cook, so keep your timer on and your ears peeled. Make sure a strainer is ready to remove the noodles as soon as the minute is up., Pour the hot noodles into your strainer and then run them under the sink using cold water. This stage removes the starchy, gummy coating that forms on the outside of the noodles as they cook. Use your hands to gently lift and toss the soba so that it all rinses off.

If the noodles feel like they may break, run the water over the back of your hand instead of directly onto the soba., This final step completely halts cooking and firms up the noodles, which are meant to be served cold., Soba noodles are meant to be served fresh, either cold or left to slightly warm towards room temperature. They are excellent with a little soy sauce or sesame oil, or paired with a dashi.
