 Many gyms and schools prefer high ponytails. If you would like to add a bow, that's up to you. You will need plenty of hair ties, bobby pins, and a headband to keep hair out of your face.;
, Most likely it's a bunch of girls anyway, so it doesn't really matter. You will need moisturizer with SPF (If you practice outside), chap-stick, and if you want, you can add a little concealer.
 Always wear sports bras (some girls only wear the bra because you can get hot), and if you would like to add a tee-shirt, or a sport shirt, that's fine too. Don't forget to wear deodorant. Many girls prefer something made for movement or sports.
 Try a comfortable pair of shorts, like Soffe's for an example, with a pair of bloomies or spankies underneath. The reason girls wear bloomies and spankies is so that when they fly, no one can see their underwear. Another plus lots of girls carry around is lotion to keep their legs from looking dry.
 If you really want to wear tennis-shoes to practice, you can though. Below is a list of brands that offer cheer shoes to check out: Nike, Nfinity, Zephs, Asics. Nfinity, however, you might want to reserve for competition or games, because they easily get dirty, and they are the most prestigious.
