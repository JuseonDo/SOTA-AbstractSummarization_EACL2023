 Produce as many villagers as you can. Once you create your first villager, make him build a house then set him on food.
 Once you have five villagers on food, get five on wood so that you have ten villagers altogether.
 Once they are done, have each of those villagers build a farm and add five farms to the mill queue. Have your wood villagers build a lumber camp near a large forest and get wood. Get two more villagers for constructing buildings and have those two build a barracks and dock if needed.
