firstly, make sure you have microsoft powerpoint!,

@summary
create an introduction slide, explain what the game is about and what the objective is: what they have to do in order to escape the room, for example, do they have to find a code for a safe in the room?

@summary
,

@summary
now, click new slide.

@summary
here is my method on how to make the game interactive.

@summary
if you want an object to do something, then duplicate the slide and change the object.

@summary
make sure that you cover each side of the room.

@summary
to create arrows in order for people to turn around the room, you can find an arrow in the shapes.

@summary
all of the above explains the basics of the game.

@summary
once they have finished, whether it be through a shaft, a locked door or a key-pad door.

@summary
i hope this article helped and good luck with your game.

 It doesn't matter if it's an earlier version or the most recent version as long as it is PowerPoint. My method should work the same on all.;
,, You now need a background as this will be the first part of your game. You could create this on PowerPoint using shapes.
 When designing your background, make sure that objects in the room are click able. A way you can do this is right click, you should see something say Hyperlink. Click on this, but first duplicate the slides a few times so when they click on an object that doesn't do anything it doesn't finish the presentation.
 For example if it was a piece of paper. Have a close up on the paper and what it says, for example a code for a safe.
 This may take a while, but go into detail and try to make it look as professional as possible.
 Basically, if they go left, place a hyperlink on that arrow to take them to that side of the room, or if the other way, the same thing.
 You now need to decide how they escape the room. Don't tell them this though! That's why it's an escape game, they need to work it out. You could provide possible clues though, if you like.
 Congratulate them on their victory.
