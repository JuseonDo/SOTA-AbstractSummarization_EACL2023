 Peel the banana first, and remove any fibrous strands. Cut the banana into thin slices with a sharp knife.
 Cover a baking sheet with wax paper and spread the bananas across it in an even layer.
 Place the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a small bowl and heat for 30 seconds. Give the mixture a stir, and heat for another 15 seconds. Stir it until all the chocolate chips have melted and the mixture is smooth. If necessary, heat the mixture for another few seconds., If you'd like, you can glue two banana slices together with some peanut butter to make mini banana sandwiches. This is completely optional, but it makes quite the treat!, Once the chocolate has cooled, spear a banana slice onto a fork, and dip it into the chocolate. Use a spoon to help you pour chocolate onto any hard-to-reach areas.


For an added touch, you can dip the banana slice into some crushed walnuts for extra protein.
 Keep dipping banana slices until you have none left.
 At this point, they are ready to eat. You can store them in small, plastic sandwich bags for easy snacking.
