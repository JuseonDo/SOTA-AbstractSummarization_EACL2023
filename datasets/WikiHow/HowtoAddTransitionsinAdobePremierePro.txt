,, The number and types of transitions depend on your version of Premiere Pro. Common transition types include dissolve, 3D motion, and slide. Each folder contains transitions that are stylistically similar but offer slightly different effects.
, Transitions can be placed in between two overlapped clips, as well as at the beginnings and endings of each clip.
 Each transition has a default time length you can alter in this way.


When you play the video clips back, the transition may stutter and jerk, depending how much you shortened or lengthened the effect. It is signified by a red bar at the top of the video clip panel. Simply hit the "Return" key on Mac or "Enter" key on Windows to create a rendered video preview. This will make the video and transitions flow smoothly.
