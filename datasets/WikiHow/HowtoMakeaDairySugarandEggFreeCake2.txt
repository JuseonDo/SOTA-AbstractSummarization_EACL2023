 Prepare the cake pan by greasing and flouring., Add the oil and mix through well. It will look grainy but this is to be expected at this point., Mix this through and it'll still look grainy but that'll be fixed shortly., Mix through and you'll have a lovely, smooth batter. Don't overmix, it is best done with a fork., Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick or skewer inserted into it comes out clean., Then tip onto a wire cooling rack and leave to cool completely.
