Add weight to the barbell according to your strength. The barbell itself weighs 45 pounds. Begin with a low weight and increase the weight as you become more comfortable with the exercise.
Use weight clips if available to ensure the weighted plates do not slide on the barbell.;
, 


While holding onto the handle, sit on the declined bench so that each leg is on one side of the bench.
  


Still holding onto the handle, secure your legs into position where your knees are a top of the padding and your shins are beneath the padding.



Once your legs are secured, let go of the handle and slowly lie down into the decline position, where the middle of your back is on the center of the bench.
    


Grab the barbell in the palm of your hands. The most important thing when it comes to the distance between your hands is comfortability. One popular distance is to grip the barbell where your elbows create around a 90 degree angle.
 


Push up on the barbell and with locked elbows hold the barbell over your chest. This is your starting position.



As you inhale, lower the barbell until it touches your lower chest.



As you exhale, push up onto the barbell and return it to the starting position which is directly over chest with your elbows locked. This resembles one rep.
 You should have difficulty on your last three reps, but never sacrifice your form to perform extra reps.



Once you have finished your last rep, return to the starting position with your locked elbows and the barbell over your chest.
  


With locked elbows, move the barbell backwards until the barbell is stationary on the rack and you can let go.



Slowly lift your upper body up from the bench watching that your head doesn't hit the barbell.
,  


Use the handle and your legs to lift yourself up from the bench.



Remove all the weight on the barbell for the next person to use.
