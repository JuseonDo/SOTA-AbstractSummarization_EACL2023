 They must be dry grounds, so if you're using grounds from your own coffee making, allow them to fully dry first. Or use the cheap instant coffee granules. Knot it off to keep the coffee intact.
 Leave it there for up to a week. During this time, it should soak up much, if not all, of the cigarette smoke odor.
 If all is good, the bag is ready for reuse. If it still smells a little, return the sock for a few more days.
