@article
 After a gentle rinse and removal of the top, cut each strawberry in half.
 Cover each half with a little fine sugar.
 The choice of cream is up to you; it can be thick but liquid or whipped so that it peaks.
 This is the artful part. Set the strawberries aside to sit for one hour at room temperature. Stir it occasionally. If preferred, the strawberries can be left in the refrigerator for up to four hours. During this time, the strawberry juice, sugar and cream are combining in a way similar to marinating. The resulting flavour is more intense and enjoyable.
 Your guests will be delighted.
