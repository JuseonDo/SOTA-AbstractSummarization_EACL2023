 You will need to do a quest which requires you to ask questions about Maplestory and get a necklace (name varies by class) to advance to the class depending on the second job you chose.
 However, don't be surprised by the amount of kill-stealers. It is a very crowded area so don't expect a whole map to yourself.
 Just like Jesters, don't expect a whole map to yourself. This is when people start being rude and competitive.
 It isn't competitive because there's a mini dungeon in the map.
 However, there are some people who will kick their party members so they can train on their own there. Finishing the Magatia Party Quest will either give you Romeo or Juliet's pendant. They both have Hidden Potential and can be combined to make a stronger pendant.
