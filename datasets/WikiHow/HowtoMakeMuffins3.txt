, Combine 2 cups of self-rising flour and 1/2 tsp. of baking soda together in a bowl. Mix well.
 Combine 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1/2 cup of finely chopped cooked ham, and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese together in a bowl.
 Combine the flour and baking soda with the rest of the ingredients. Stir until the dry ingredients have moistened.
 If you don't have muffin cups or don't want to use them, just grease the tray a bit.
 This will give the muffins enough room to expand.
 After 12 minutes, insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean. Once it does, the muffins are done. Let the muffins cool on the pan and then transfer them to a wire rack.
 Enjoy these muffins as a tasty breakfast treat.
