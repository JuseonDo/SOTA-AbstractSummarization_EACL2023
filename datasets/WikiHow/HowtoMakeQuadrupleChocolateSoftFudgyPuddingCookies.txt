 Preheat oven 160ÂºC.;
, Make sure that there are no lumps in the flour and that there is enough air in the flour.
, Add the caster/superfine sugar, 2 eggs, milk, toffee yoghurt and drinking chocolate. Stir and mix in well.
 Stir in. Grate the bar of chocolate into the mixture and stir through. The mixture will now resemble cookie dough.
 Flatten each ball with the back of the metal spoon.
 Do not allow them to touch at the edges; leave room for spreading during baking.
 Bake for 25 minutes or until the cookies appear done.
 Open the oven door and remove the cookies briefly. Spread a little milk over the top of each cookie and add the white chocolate buttons/ chopped white chocolate to the top of the cookies. Then pop the tray/sheet back into the oven and bake the cookies using the residual heat in the oven for a further 5 minutes.
 Remove from the baking tray/sheet with a spatula or fish slice. Place on the wire rack to cool.
 Store uneaten cookies in an airtight container and eat within a few days. These go well with a pot of tea.
