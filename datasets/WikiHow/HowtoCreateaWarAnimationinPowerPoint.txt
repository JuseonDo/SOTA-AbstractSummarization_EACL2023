 But insert the slide first.
 At a base camp? Or a rendezvous mission? You think about it.
 If you want a moving frame, read step 14.
 For example, a shape is at the right slide of the slide. A clip by clip feature is making another slide, then on the second slide, you move the shape onto the left side of the slide.
 For example, a shape is at the right side of the slide. Make another slide, then copy and paste the shape onto the second slide. Then add an animation by selecting the shape/animations/custom animation/motion paths/draw custom path/freeform. Then, once the cross or reticule has appeared, click the middle of the shape, then hover your mouse at the right side of the slide (not at the very right. Just nearly at the end), then double click to finish.
 If you see that it is not good, then change it. If it is good, then start it with previous.
