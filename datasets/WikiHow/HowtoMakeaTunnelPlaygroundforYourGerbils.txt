@summary
when you're finished with toilet paper and paper towel cardboard tubes, get ready to reuse them!,

@summary
once you have 3-5 tubes, or enough tubes that you can build the tunnels you want, you can begin the very first steps to making an intricate tunnel system.

@summary
cut gerbil-sized holes every here and there, so they can come in and out as they please.

@summary
you will want to empty the cage of the bedding, and put it aside if it is still clean.

@summary
watch your gerbils as they examine the openings, pretty soon they will disappear into the ground!

 You'll need around 3-5 of them to make a tunnel playground.;
,


To join tubes together, use scissors to cut 4 little slits around the very end of the tube, by the hole. Put the other tube in between these slits to join them. If it isn't fastened on tight enough, make the slits deeper. Make the system however long you want, but it has to fit inside the cage.
 If you don't do so, the Gerbil may get the feeling he or she is stuck, or that he or she is losing air. It is always good to have little escape windows every few inches.


Connect the tunnels to make the playground more interesting.






You can add them in different places.
 Adjust the system how you find appropriate in the bottom of the cage, and then add back the bedding. You will want to make sure at least 2 escape routes are showing, because if one Gerbil is trying to get in the same way as another Gerbil is trying to get out, it may end up in a fight. This may still happen, but 2 openings decreases the chance of that.
 Now, remember, don't be alarmed if one day you come home or approach the Gerbil's cage and they are not in sight, check the tunnel system before you panic. Have fun, and I hope you enjoyed making your Gerbils a tunnel playground!
