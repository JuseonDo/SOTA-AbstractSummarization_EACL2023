 Use drop cloths for larger spaces and painter's tape for smaller spaces.;
, Wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Put on safety goggles and a dust mask before starting any work. Metal flakes will be scattered as you prepare the metal.



You can also use diluted, mild detergent.
 This should remove dirt and remaining rust.
, Most rusty railings have a layer of flaky rust covering their surface. Use the wire brush to remove as much rust as possible.


If you have large or intricate railings, or if you have a lot of rust on the surface, you can buy a wire brush attachment for a drill. Attach the brush to the drill and move along the entire surface of the railing. It will make the job easier.
 Medium grit is between 80 and 120 grit. This is called scuff-sanding and it should take gloss off the surface and allow the primer and paint to bond more easily.


Sand rough spots with coarse sandpaper, from 40 to 60 grit.
, This is sometimes called "direct-to-metal" primer. First apply your coat of paint, then brush it into the crevices before it dries.
 Once again, use a brush to get into all the crevices of the metal railing.


If you do not have time to do all the steps in 1 day, wait until the next to sand and apply primer and paint.
, You can use a spray can, roller or brush to apply the topcoat. Brush the coat with a paint brush to remove any drips and get into the crevices.
