 If you do not have a fresh orange, use 1.5 teaspoons (7.4 milliliters) of dried citrus peels or 1/2 ounce (15 milliliters) of orange oil. Citrus is especially helpful in targeting soft-bodied bugs, including slugs, aphids, fungus gnats, and mealy bugs. When sprayed directly onto the pests, this pesticide also works against ants and roaches.
 Allow the solution to sit in a warm spot for 24 hours.
 Pour it into a strainer, removing the peels and saving the citrus-infused water.
 Peppermint-scented castile soap may prove especially effective. Mix the solution thoroughly to combine.
 Spray the entire plant to ward off most soft-bodied pests. Spray directly on top of ants and roaches.
