 The other opponent won't stick to the wall, so you won't crash into the other car. Also, you turn faster than if you don't stick to the wall, as the wall provides support.;
, You can then drive the car to the sand so that his car will need time to recover from the crash. Use the time to go as fast as you can.
 You can crash into the wall or your opponent with the back or back side of the car. You won't get a penalty. Block your opponent from advancing forward that way.
