@summary
pull the four aces from a standard deck of cards.

@summary
fully shuffle the deck (except for the aces) and split in half.

@summary
,

@summary
place the four aces in a square, 2 x 2.

@summary
stand facing your two volunteers.

@summary
instruct the volunteers that you will be "projecting" the color of the card into their minds.

@summary
start with the first volunteer.

@summary
when you have run out of black cards, say something similar to "well, i see we're about halfway through the deck.

@summary
repeat step six using the red cards, volunteer two, and the bottom row of aces.

@summary
,

@summary
at this point, you have all the black cards on the top row covering both the black and red aces, and all the red cards on the bottom row covering both the red and black aces.

@summary
pick up the two piles in the left hand column, and pass each one to the volunteer who "filled" the pile.

@summary
while they are examining the cards from the left column, pick up the top right pile and lay it on top of the bottom pile.

@summary
,

@summary
pick up the remaining pile.

;
,, Make sure that each row and each column has both a black and a red ace. For example: if the top row (left to right) is Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, then the bottom row (left to right) would be Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs.
 Using your "off" hand (ie, left hand if you're right-handed,) fan one half of the deck of cards so that you can see the face of the cards, while the volunteers see the backing. Leave the other half of the deck alone.
 Tell them to tell you the first color that pops into their minds.
 Select any black card from your fanned hand and hold it (facing you) in front of your forehead. Make a show of "projecting" the color by squinting, glaring, etc. When the volunteer says either "Red" or "Black", lay the card face down on the corresponding ace in the top row. Place the face down card horizontally, so that the ace and the face down pile make a cross. Continue "showing" black cards to the first volunteer in this manner until you have run out and are holding only red cards in your fan.
 To show that this isn't a trick and I have pre-arranged, I'll move on to .
, The cards in the left hand column match the ace colors, while those in the right hand column do not.
 Instruct them to verify that the color is correct, and to share with each other so that they can both see.
, At this point, your pile consists of red cards (face down,) black ace (face up,) black cards (face down) and red ace (face up.) Move the red ace from the bottom of the pile to the top, and split the pile apart. Now, repeat step 10 -- the colors are now correct.
