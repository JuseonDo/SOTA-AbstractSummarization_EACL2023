 Various manufacturers have slightly different steps and required amounts you should put in. However, there are some steps that are generally the same.
 This may or may not be necessary depending on why your tire is flat.
 Unscrew your valve cap. You will put the sealant in the same way that you would inflate your tire with air.
 Once you have it on securely, press a button to release the contents.
 You need to drive your car to rotate the tire. This allows the sealant to be distributed evenly inside the tire and prevents it from forming a heavy lump inside the tire.
 Tire sealants are great to bail you out in a major crisis. Unfortunately they are only good for 3 days or 100 miles, whichever comes first. You should replace your tire before then to avoid possible problems.
