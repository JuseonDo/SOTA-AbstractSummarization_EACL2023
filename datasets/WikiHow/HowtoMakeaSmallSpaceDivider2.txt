 If the area to be divided is longer than one curtain, choose another one or two in the same design.


If the design is stripes, spots or some other pattern, you might consider varying the colors, as long as they match nicely.
 Hang this either at ceiling height or above the area of a tall person walking through.


You may also like to attach a curtain tieback hook on a wall or area for ease of pulling the curtain back to one side if needed. This step is optional.
