, Scrub the potatoes clean, then cut them into ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick wedges. Leave the skins on the potatoes.
 Put the paprika, ground cumin, salt, and black pepper into the bowl first, and mix them briskly together with a fork. Stir in the oil next until everything is evenly combined.
 An easy way to do this is to cover the bowl with a large plate, lid, or plastic wrap, and then shake it a few times to toss the ingredients together.
 Do not crowd the potatoes. If your baking sheet is too small, it is better to set the extra potatoes aside and bake them in a separate batch. This will allow them to turn nice and crispy.
 After about 20 minutes, use a spatula to flip them over. This will ensure that both sides get evenly baked and turn crispy. The fries are ready when they turn golden brown and crispy.
 They go great with steaks as well as other dishes, including homemade burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches.
