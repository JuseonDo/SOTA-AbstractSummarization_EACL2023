 Draw the body and wings with ovals as well. Add in guidelines to help you with the details.
 Add a pointy, thin triangle for the beak as shown, and include a line for the mouth., Position one of them above the ground like it's taking a step. Draw thin ovals for the legs and three even thinner shapes for the toes. Sketch in the tail., Make sure to include feathers and the division between the beak and the rest of the face. Then outline your bird and erase any unnecessary guidelines., Use white and brown for the body, and then the feet should be the bird's signature cyan color.,
