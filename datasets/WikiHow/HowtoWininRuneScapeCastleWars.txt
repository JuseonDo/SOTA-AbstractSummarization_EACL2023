destroy the barricades that are in your team mates' way.

, Castle Wars isn't just about combat! It's mainly about being fast and sneaky, and barricades will slow your team mates down, unless you destroy them before they get to them.
 Think about it: what do you expect more, someone running toward your castle from underground, or above ground through all the chaos?

 This is probably the easiest way to contribute to your team. There will be players coming for your flag alone and others will come in groups, so be aware and have a decent combat level. If you're guarding the flag alone, make sure you have a combat level of at least one hundred. If you're there with your team mates, make sure you have a combat level of at least eighty.
