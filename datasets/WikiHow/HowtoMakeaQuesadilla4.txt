 You will need ½ cup (50 grams) of cheese and ½ cup (120 grams) of a filling of your choice, such as diced tomatoes, onions, shredded chicken breast, or beans. Gently toss your fillings together in a clean bowl.
 Avoid using too high heat; it will only make your quesadilla burn instead of cooking faster., Make sure that the grill is clean, so that the charcoal doesn't transfer to the tortilla.
 Use a spoon to scoop the fillings out of the bowl and transfer them onto the tortilla.
 Work quickly, so that the tortilla doesn't harden; if you wait too long, the tortilla will become crispy and break in half. Slip a spatula under the side of the tortilla that does not have anything on it, and lift upwards, folding the tortilla in half.
, Be careful, so that it does not come apart and spill everything into the grill.
 Use a spatula to move the quesadilla from the grill to a plate. Cut it into wedges using a sharp knife. You can eat the quesadilla as it is, or serve it with toppings, such as salsa or sour cream.
