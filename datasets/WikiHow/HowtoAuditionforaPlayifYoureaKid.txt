 You might want to go on the theaters website.;
, If you need a song prepared, get it. You usually won't have to sing a long one, so sing a short song, but make sure it's from a musical! That way the director will see your passion for theatre! Don't sing anything like 'Happy Birthday', though, because everyone knows that song. It will come across to the director that you did not prepare for the audition.], Actors need to be punctual, show the director that you can do anything he/she needs you to do.
, If you are, just look at one place in the place you're auditioning for the play, and focus on that, that will make you forget about everything, and it'll make your voice get louder.
 He/She may give you time to think about how you will say your line(s) in that section. Always aim for a callback.
 If you have a sore throat, tell the director, and the director won't push you too' hard. Do your best.
 (Or tell right then.)
