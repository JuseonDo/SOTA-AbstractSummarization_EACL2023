If the Google account associated with your Android is the same one you use for Gmail, you should be able to launch the app and reach your inbox without making additional changes.
To add a Gmail address that isn’t yet on your phone, continue with this method.
, The “Set up email” screen will appear.
,, You’ll notice a “Forgot password” link beneath the password blank. If you don’t remember your password, tap that link and follow its prompts.
 Once you accept, the setup will be complete.
