 Demise's sword will be absorbed by the electricity. If you try attacking him, you will be shocked. You cannot use the Skyward Strike.
 Sidestep or quickly roll away.
 Quickly unleash it on Demise before he runs up and strikes you down or blocks your Skyward Strike with one of his.
 Keep hitting until he gets back up without attacking too much or you will lose focus and Demise can attack without you defending yourself fast enough to.
, Either backflip or shield-bash at the last moment. You can always prevent this by going close but not too close and tempting him to hit you after he gets up you attack him.
 Quickly deliver an Ending Blow before he gets back up and you have to go through a short form of phase 2. This will always fail the first time, but if you are very fast, the second time you can finish him. If not, you can always try again for the third and fourth time.
 You've beaten The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. Enjoy the ending, and wait three years for the next.
