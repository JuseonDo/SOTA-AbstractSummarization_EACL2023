 You will need 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket and 6-8 skeins for a larger throw blanket.


Crochet hooks range in size from B to S, with S being the largest. The bigger the hook, the larger the stitch.
 The single crochet is the easier of the two, so beginners should learn the single crochet before attempting the double crochet.
 Slide a slipknot onto the crochet hook, wrap the yarn around the hook from the back to the front and draw a new loop through the knot.
 Start behind the hook and come over the hook and then draw it underneath.


For a double crochet, insert the hook under the fourth loop from the hook. Yarn over the hook and pull it through the center of the chain. Then yarn over the hook and draw the yarn through the first two loops from the hook. Repeat for the last two loops on the hook.
 Work from left to right.
 You can switch colors whenever you get to the end of a row before flipping your work if you like.
 Incorporate any loose ends into the blanket with small stitches before trimming the ends.
