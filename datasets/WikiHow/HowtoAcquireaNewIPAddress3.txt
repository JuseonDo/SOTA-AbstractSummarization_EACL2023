 It's the apple-shaped icon in the top-left corner of the screen., You'll see this option in the Apple Menu drop-down window., This will open the Network window., You'll do so from the left-hand pane in the Network window., It's in the lower-right area of the window., This tab is near the top of the Advanced window., This number is your Mac's current IP address., It's to the right of the IP address area. Doing so will refresh your device's current IP address., It will be to the right of the "IPv4" value. If the number here is different than it was before releasing and renewing your IP address, your device's local IP address has successfully been changed.

This process will only work if your computer is on an Ethernet connection with other devices. Trying to change your public IP address with this method won't work.
