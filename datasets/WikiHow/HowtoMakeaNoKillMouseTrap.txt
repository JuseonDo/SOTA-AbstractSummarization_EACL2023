@summary
find a finished cardboard roll.

@summary
squash the cardboard tube so that the tube is flattened down one side.

@summary
place bait into one end of the tube.

@summary
place the tube over the edge of a countertop or table so that it balances precariously.

@summary
place a tall trash can under the lip of the countertop or table over which you've balanced the tube.

@summary
wait.

@summary
if you have no suitable surface for a mouse to fall into the trash can from, you can create a ramp from a simple cardboard box and "reset" your trap that way.

@summary
clean the trash can thoroughly with hot soapy water and dispose of any mouse poop using rubber gloves.

@article
 A kitchen paper towel or toilet tissue roll is ideal for this purpose.;
, This creates a flat surface at the base of the tube, while leaving a small tunnel for the mouse to scuttle through. The end result will appear like a "D" shape, as pictured.
 Something like peanut butter is ideal.
 Make sure that the end with the bait is hanging into the air.
 The trash can should be lined or clean so that you're not introducing additional germs to the creature.


Leave this set up overnight.
You may also wish to crumple up some paper towel or newspaper to create a soft layer in the bottom of the trash can. Make it a shallow layer â€“ too high and the mouse may use it to climb to a height that it can use to jump out of the trash can.
 The mouse (or other furry creature) should be attracted by the bait and run into the tube trap. The trap will tip the mouse into the trash can; you'll know that it worked if the cardboard tube is in the trash can in the morning.


Wear gloves when handling the creature, or gently prod it into a smaller container using something like a shoehorn. Another alternative is to carry the entire trash can outside and tip it on its side and let the mouse run free.
