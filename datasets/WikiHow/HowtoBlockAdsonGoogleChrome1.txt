 This app is a red, yellow, green, and blue sphere. While you can't block embedded ads in the Google Chrome mobile browser, you can prevent pop-ups from appearing and taking over your screen.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen. Doing so invokes a drop-down menu., You'll find this option near the bottom of the drop-down menu., It's near the bottom of the page., You'll find this option near the top of the screen (iPhone) or near the bottom of the screen (Android)., Doing so will cause Google Chrome to block any pop-up ads.

If this switch is already in the "On" position, Google Chrome is blocking pop-ups.
