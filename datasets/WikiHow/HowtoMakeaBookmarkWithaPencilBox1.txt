@article
 Use a color you like a lot or, for a rainbow effect, choose a variety of colors.;
, Don't use too much glue, or it will take a long time to dry.
 Let sit for about 2 to 4 days.


This takes a while to dry, and it takes longer the more glue used. Do not peel off the glue until it has fully dried.
It is done when it feels fully dry to the touch. If it's wet at all, leave it be.
 The edges will rise and there will be a little dark spot in the center, or no white spots will be visible.
 The jelly bookmark is now finished and ready to use..
