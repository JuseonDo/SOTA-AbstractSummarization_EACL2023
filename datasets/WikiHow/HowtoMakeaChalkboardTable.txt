 Hit the top with extra vigor. You want the tabletop to be smooth and even. Use your clean cloth to remove debris as you work and continue sanding until you have achieved the desired smoothness.


Sand the table legs. Make sure you remove any wood that is splintering or rough.

, Apply a smooth even coat making sure the entire top is covered. Don’t glob on the paint as you will be adding several coats.


Allow first coat to dry before adding second coat. For best results, allow your table to dry in a cool, non-humid area.
 The number of coats depends upon your preference and wood consistency of the table (some material absorbs paint more than others).
