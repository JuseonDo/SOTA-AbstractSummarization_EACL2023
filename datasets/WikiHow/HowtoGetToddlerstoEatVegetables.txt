 Toddlers can get all the vitamins and minerals they need from other foods besides vegetable. Healthy toddlers offered a variety of foods will choose a balanced diet over time.;
, Toddlers have small stomachs. If their tummies are full of pretzels or fruit juice, they won't have room for vegetables at dinner time.
 Steaming preserves the natural flavor of the vegetable, and preserves the nutrients too.
 Children can be resistant to new things, so don't worry if they reject peas at first. It can take ten or more offers before they accept a new food.
 Toddlers like to serve themselves, not be fed with a spoon. Also, putting several foods on their plate means they can choose what they feel like at the moment.
 Parents often have unrealistic expectations about how much their toddlers actually need. If the child is growing well and meeting developmental milestones, he's probably fine.
 Vegetables are low in calories, so kids don't want to fill up their stomachs with them. Kids are smart, and won't choose vegetables over carbohydrates if they are really hungry.
, If your child likes pigs-in-a-blanket, make vegetables in croissant rolls.
