, For example, page margins of .5" all around, a simple 4 column grid, with .125" gutter, and horizontal divisions every 1". Note that a grid simply organizes your elements, columns and art can be more than one column wide but don't overdo it.
 Proportion the masthead to take up a little less than a third of the depth of the front page, e.g., if your copy area is 7.5 wide x 10" deep, a 7.5 x 2" masthead with about an inch of white space below will be about right.
 To begin, keep the number of styles to a minimum. For example, Body text, Headline, Subhead, Caption, Bulleted List, Contact Info might be all you need.
