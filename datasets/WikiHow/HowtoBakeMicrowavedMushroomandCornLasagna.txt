 The pan needs to be deep enough to accommodate all of the ingredients for the red sauce.;
, Let it cook for 2 minutes. Then add the onion paste. Let it cook till slightly brown.
 Cover with a lid for 2 minutes. Then put in the ketchup. Mix again and cover for 4-5 minutes.
 Then add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. The red sauce is now ready.
 Olive oil can be substituted, if preferred.
 Add flour (continuously whisking it) to the extent of arriving at a soft, fluffier texture.
 Once this consistency is achieved, put the pan back onto the flame (low) and now add milk (continuously stirring) to create a saucy texture. Add the seasonings now.
, If instant, skip this section.
 Add 4-5 drops of oil so that when the lasagna is added, the sheets won't stick to each other.
 Cook for 10 to 15 minutes (or as long as instructed by the packaging).
 Lay the lasagna sheets one by one on a flat surface. Mostly, a plastic tray would do.
,,, Then add a sheet of lasagna. Spread white sauce over it followed by some shredded mozzarella cheese. Then spread the red sauce, another lasagna sheet, white sauce spread evenly and some cheese. Continue with these steps till the final sheet of lasagna comes on top.
 Spread all the shredded cheese as much as you would like over the top.
 There is no preheating of the microwave required. Simply place in the dish and turn on the settings for convection mode or baking mode at 140 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or till the crust of the dish is golden brown.
