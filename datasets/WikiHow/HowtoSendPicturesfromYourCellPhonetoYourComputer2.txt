 Most phones you purchase now will come with a USB cable that allows it to be connected directly to your computer. If your phone didn't come with one, search online for a new or used one you can buy, or contact your phone's manufacturer.
 Make sure the phone is on.



If you use iTunes to manage files on your phone, simply press the drop arrow next to your phone on the left-hand sidebar. Double-click photos, and drag what you want onto your desktop or into a new folder.
If you don't use iTunes, open your phone like you would any detachable drive. Click My Computer or Finder to locate it. Drag and drop any photos you want to your desktop or a new folder.
Sometime on Android phones the windows will not install the required software so you should install it manually from the internet or via CD.
