,, You can use a dough hook on an electric mixer or knead it by hand to mix the ingredients together. Keep kneading it until it becomes elastic and smooth. Add some extra flour if the dough is too moist., Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl coated with vegetable oil. Put the plastic wrap over it, and let it sit for 30-60 minutes. You can also put the dough inside the refrigerator, but the dough will require an extra hour of proofing this way. If you're not ready to make the doughnuts yet, you can always freeze the dough before it rises to save it for later.,, Use a smaller 1-inch cutter to make the holes. Plastic bottle caps or martini shaker caps work well for this job. The doughnut holes can be recombined to make more doughnuts, or they can be fried along with the rest of the doughnuts., You can use a meat thermometer or an infrared temperature scanner to test the temperature., Use a spoon or spatula that has drip holes to let the oil flow out., If you are making doughnut holes, fry them for 30 seconds per side.,, This will help reduce the fat content of the doughnuts., In a small bowl, mix confectioners' sugar, hot water, and almond extract until smooth and creamy. Dip the still-warm doughnuts into glaze and let excess drip off.,
