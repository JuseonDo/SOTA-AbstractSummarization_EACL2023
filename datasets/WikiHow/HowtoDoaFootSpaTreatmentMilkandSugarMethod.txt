before getting started with the spa treatment, arrange on the floor, in front of a comfortable chair, a towel big enough to fit a large bowl on.

@summary
in a large saucepan, heat 2 cups of milk and 7 cups of water until it is as hot as you can stand.

@summary
when the milk/water mix is ready, put it in a bowl large enough to fit both feet in.

@summary
after soaking, remove your feet and scoop some of the sugar mix.

 Have an extra towel and a good book ready.;
, While it's heating, mix 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) of lotion until all the sugar is coated and the mixture is slightly soupy.
 Set the empty bowl down on the towel, and pour the milk/water mixture in. Place the sugar mix nearby and place your feet in the milky mix. Soak for about 10 minutes while reading a chapter from your book.
 Use your fingers to scrub the sugar mix onto feet bottoms, tops, and between the toes. Scrub until you feel you have exfoliated well enough. Place feet back in the milk/water mixture and rinse well.
 Slather your piggies with some moisture-rich lotion and sock them until you're ready to show them off. Voila! Super touchable soft feet!
