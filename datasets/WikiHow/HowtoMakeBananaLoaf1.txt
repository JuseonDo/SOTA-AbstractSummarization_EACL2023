, Use a conventional 20 x 13cm tin or a muffin tin.
 Place them in a large mixing bowl and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy., Continue beating until the mixture is completely combined.
 Stir together the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and ginger until fully combined.
 Use a wooden spoon to fold the dry ingredients in until they're just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, since this will cause the loaf to come out too dense.


If desired, stir in 50g chopped pecans, walnuts, almonds or chocolate chips (or a combination of all of your favorites). Mix until just combined.
 Use the back of the spoon to level the top.
 The loaf is ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean.
 Serve the loaf with butter or whipped cream.
