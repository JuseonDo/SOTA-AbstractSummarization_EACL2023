@summary
exit the pit and set down all supplies at your workstation.

@summary
using this information, and using clues from the surrounding landscape, determine the hill slope profile position and land form.

@summary
determine the surface runoff by first observing if the soil surrounding the pit has a ground cover or if it is left bare.

@summary
return to your workstation.

@summary
work samples, one at a time, into a moist ball of soil in your non-writing hand.

@summary
if your sample has gravels or channels in it, run it through the 2-mm sieve and estimate the amount and size of these rock fragments.

 Shoot slope by looking through the clinometer at eye level from the top of one slope stake. Read the measurement where you see the tip of the second slope stake in the viewfinder. For best precision, walk to the other slope stake and repeat. Average these two scores and fill in the slope section of the description sheet.
 If there is no slope, check “none” for hill slope position.
 If bare soil is visible, then the ground cover is poor. In any other case, the ground cover is considered to be good. Use the following trick to record surface runoff: for good ground cover, check the box for the surface runoff one category lower than the slope on the sheet, and for poor ground cover, two categories lower.
 Open your Munsell color book and match moist, freshly broken samples from each horizon to the color swatches in the booklet. Use the color that is most commonly seen throughout the sample when matching colors. This is called the matrix color. Disregard minor colors, as these are redoximorphic features and will be discussed later. Fill in the color section of the description sheet with the hue, value, and chroma listed in the color book.
 Without referencing the textural triangle, determine the soil texture and estimate the percent clay.
 Record in the “rock fragment modifier” column.
