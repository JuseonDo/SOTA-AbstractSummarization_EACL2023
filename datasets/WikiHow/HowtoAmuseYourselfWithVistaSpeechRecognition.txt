@summary
if you haven't already set up speech recognition, do so now.

@summary
say: "start listening.

@summary
make random noises like laughing (lots of laughing- it should be the majority of the noise you make anyway), moaning, "ppppbbbhhhhhhttt"-ing, burping, and saying random words (only occasionally- swear words work well for this) into the microphone.

@summary
,

@summary
every so often give it some time to catch up.

@summary
when you have enough to amuse yourself (maybe one or two paragraphs), say "stop listening" and close speech recognition.

@summary
open sound recorder and start recording- *read back* the text that speech recognition has left you, and laugh if you have to.

@summary
listen to yourself reading the random, epic story.

@summary
repeat if you want.

@article
 Go through the tutorial and then continue to step 2.;
, Open Notepad. Maximize that." If it doesn't understand you, don't waste time repeating yourself, and do it manually.
, Make sure it is done thinking by saying something simple like "butter", and if it comes up immediately, then continue. If it isn't then wait- if you don't your computer and/or speech recognition may crash, regardless of how great your computer is.
 Save the text file in notepad, something like "random shiz".
 When you've gotten to the end, stop recording and save that file with the same name as the text (in case you do many) with "read" on the end. Example, "random shiz read".
 If any of it makes a lick of sense, you've failed. Try again. If you laugh because it makes no sense whatsoever and yet is epic and amazingly fail, you've won. Go make cookies and quote your favorite "sentence" for the rest of the day. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN to people who ask what the heck you're talking about, or you'll look... really weird.
