@summary
if you aren't hidden by the time they are looking, dart to the nearest place, even if it's obvious.

, (If possible do it silently).
 This is the key.
 The human mind instinctively looks left, right, and back -- but not up or down. Make sure you're not at eye-level.
 This will make whoever sees you less likely to associate a small shape with a human body in their brain.
 The human eye detects motion before anything else, even more so at night.
, There's a much higher chance of staying hidden if you don't move. Even if they seem to be looking right at you they may not have seen you, so don't even move your eyes if they are looking in your direction.
 (e.g. if you are wearing all black clothes in a bedroom, it may still work to get on a bed with pillows, get behind all the pillows, and then curl up to disguise yourself as a pillow.)

, The person (or people) you're hiding from would not think to look in such a small area.
 Use the steps detailed above.

Hide in the basement! Or the garage! You can even hide in the car, but be careful that you don't mess around with the car and accidentally start the engine and make sure you don't lock yourself inside. Open the window just a little bit for air circulation but not enough to be noticable.
Hide behind a sofa. If there are some curtains behind a sofa, hide behind them too, for double protection. If people look behind the sofa all they will see is the curtains (which you are hiding behind.)
Hide under a large pile of pillows!
