 They should work well together and enjoy healthy competition. However, they should respect each other at all times.
 With team goals, come team incentives, so make sure everyone is interested in the incentive.
 Goals rely on accurate benchmarks and reporting., A team can work with these to cover all their bases and present a united front.
 A social drink or dinner occasionally will encourage people to support each other and strive for large goals., If someone isn’t performing, give them a chance to rectify it. However, if they don’t work hard or mesh well, tactfully reassign them.
 Ideally, this person should be willing to accept some risk and reward for their extra work.
