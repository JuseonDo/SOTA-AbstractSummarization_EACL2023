tie a barrel not in the end of the 1/8” ropes.

@summary
with the 1/4” ropes tie a bowline knot through the double grommets on the outsides of the aft grommet section.

@summary
now tighten all of the ropes to achieve the desired tension on the trampoline.

@summary
trim the excess rope and melt the end with a lighter (be careful not to melt the trampoline!),time to go sailing!
@article
, Insert the untied end up through the hull lacing slot at the front of the boat, through the first webbing loop, and back down into the same lacing slot. Repeat this lacing towards the back of the boat on both sides. Leave the ropes untied and semi loose for now.
 Lace both sides inwards until they meet in the center and both pass through the same grommet. Next continue lacing each line one more loop. The two lines should now both end under the trampoline on the same side with a grommet in between them., The side lacing should finish with a barrel knot under the lip of the hull (as it started). For the aft lacing; tie a bowline knot in one rope, pass the second aft rope through the bowline knot, and tie three half hitches., We suggest leaving approximately five inches of rope at the end of the knots for later adjustments.,
