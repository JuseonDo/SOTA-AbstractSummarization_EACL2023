 You want to make sure it has a flat surface and that it is entirely edible. Never eat apple seeds!;
, With the flat surface down, you want to cut two diagonal lines near the center of the slice you just cut and create a point.
 This creates the "exoskeleton" of the mouth and creates the upper and lower lips. Get your spoonful of peanut butter ready.
 Make sure it is completely filled in and use your spoon to smooth out the edges.


This may be a good time to use a paper towel and wipe away any excess peanut butter left on the "lips." The peanut butter acts as the gums of the mouth and offers a sticky surface which is helpful for the final step.
 Since these are acting as the mouth's teeth, the more crooked and disturbing they look, the better. It does not need to be perfect, it just needs to look spooky! This is also the fun aspect for kids to be a part of. They can design their own mouths to look any way they would like!


The final outcome should look a lot like this. Although it is not necessary, try continuing with some of the additional steps to make them even more festive and spooky. However, it is perfectly fine to stop here and enjoy your snack.
 You can use a green apple this time, but it does not matter which color you use. Hold the bottle over your newly created mouth and let the sauce drip all over it. This creates a bloody and gory look that is sure to give children nightmares.
 Let it sit for about ten minutes until it starts to melt. You can then place your apple on the plate and use your spoon to pour some of the melted ice cream on top of your apple mouth. This mouth came right off of a slimy monster.
 Take pinch-fulls of the cookie powder and sprinkle it all over the apple mouth and the plate. This mouth ate itself out of its own grave.
 Insert as many pieces as you wish into the peanut butter, in between the two rows of sliced almonds (teeth). This mouth fell right off of a monster that eats insects.
