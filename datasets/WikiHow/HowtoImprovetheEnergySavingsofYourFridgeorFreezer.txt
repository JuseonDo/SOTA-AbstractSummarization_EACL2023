 The most common source of heat in a kitchen is the oven and the dishwasher, but some kitchens also have a water heater in place as well. Keep the fridge or freezer well away from these heat sources. If you situate a fridge next to an oven, for example, the fridge will over-compensate for the heating up. For the same reason, it is also important to avoid placing a fridge or freezer in direct, constant sunlight.;
, If the doors don't shut tightly, energy is wasted. Clean them regularly and replace once worn.
 Only buy a fridge or freezer at the size for normal usage. The larger the fridge, the greater the energy usage. Your power bill will reflect this choice too!

, These are suitable temperatures that will save on energy usage. Every degree colder adds more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.
 The appliance will try to compensate by cooling down the item. Equally, keep cold items cold by returning cold items to the fridge quickly after use.
 Good circulation of air around the coils helps the fridge or freezer work less hard, thereby using up less energy and your energy bills will be reduced. Keep the coils clean with a regular vacuum or dusting; dust decreases efficiency.
