 Don't do anything the truck wouldn't expect you to do.;
,, To safely pass a truck, wait until you see the entirety of the truck's front in your rear-view mirror. Only then can you turn back into the lane.
 This includes directly behind the truck and along the length of the truck.
 Only cross when the tires are at a complete standstill.
 To avoid a collision, the truck driver should always be aware of where you intend to go.



Because they're larger than cars, trucks cannot stop or react as quickly as one might expect. Always let a truck driver know exactly when you're going to cross in front of him.
