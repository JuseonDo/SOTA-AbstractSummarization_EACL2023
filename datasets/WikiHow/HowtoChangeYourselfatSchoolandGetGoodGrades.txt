Find a balance. Although you have to learn more (because you probably missed something the years before) don't forget your friends. Maybe you can a agree on one day a week where you meet together and do whatever you like.
 Many preps and jocks are known to have high grades too. Be careful though. Most so-called "nerds" are stereotypically helpful and easily persuaded. Not all though, so be careful not to assume that a person is nice because they are a "nerd". Don't just leave your old friends behind, though. Just make new ones, and balance between the two. You don't want to work too hard, and you don't want to play too hard as well.
 So do not make fun of them!, It is one of your top priorities. If you get distracted, say to yourself "I have to work smarter, not just harder to learn so I can earn good grades, to get a good job, and go to college." This is important -- don't tell yourself maybe you'll go to college -- tell yourself it's going to happen, and that is that.
 You want to be doctor a an author. Then you probably know that your grades have to be good to go to college. Focus on that dream!, Don't start and then quit two weeks or two months later. You have to be determined; make this a habit.
 It's satisfying - isn't it?,, Some of the programs are, but others you might find really helpful and interesting.
 Don't study months before a really important exam, study just a month before or you might become demotivated. Make notes as your revise but you have to remember to have time to read and learn your notes as well.
