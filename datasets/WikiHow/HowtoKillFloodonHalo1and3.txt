@summary
on halo 1, a shotgun will take care of combat forms in the most expedient way possible (excepting a rocket launcher or any type of explosive).

@summary
on halo 3, there are flood pure forms, which are a lot harder to kill.

@summary
for halo 3 the flood can be generally be easily killed on any difficulty, the only time they put up a decent fight is when you are playing on heroic difficulty, and they can be an actual challenge when you play on legendary difficulty.

@summary
when you encounter a tank flood form,unsc weapons are weak against these huge things!if you find an energy sword or rocket launcher,and fuel rod cannon kill them quickly they can also pack a punch!

 On Halo 3, duel wielding Plasma Rifles is your best bet. Any precision weapon will do as well, as long as you hit the Infection form that's embedded inside the Combat Form's chest. An almost just as good solution is to use the Magnum Pistol. It takes out most combat forms in 1 to 3 shots. Even on the harder difficulties such as heroic or legendary.;
, Tank Forms (the big ones) are nearly impervious to most weapons, however they will be killed instantly by an energy sword lunge, they can spew out infection forms as a special attack. Ranged Forms (the ones that cling on walls) will shoot at you from a distance. Stalker Forms (the little spider-looking things that crawl around you) will jump and attack you. Stalker Forms are the easiest to deal with. They are very weak. A simple melee will take care of them. use a sword (which are found on the bodies of elites or flood throughout the level) on the tank forms. on all difficulty settings they will die. for the ranged forms generally you will want to put them into shield mode and advance until you get within range to stick or melee them. one of each will kill them.
 Or if you turn any of the following Skulls; Mythic, Tilt, Famine, Fog, Thunderstorm, & Black-eye.
