 This will keep your email stored remotely, rather than on your local computer, and will mean that you can access your same emails and folders from other computers, too, rather than having emails only downloaded and stored on your local system.
 To do a manual configuration, select the "IMAP" option and click on "Manual config."


For a manual setup, enter the server settings as follows:






Incoming Server: imap.mail.yahoo.com
Outgoing Server: smtp.mail.yahoo.com
Incoming Port: 993 with SSL
Outgoing Port: 465 with SSL or port 587 with SSL/TLS


Click "Re-test" to make sure the settings are accurate. If it's successful, move on. If not, double-check that you have entered everything correctly.
, You'll now find your Yahoo folder set up in Thunderbird!
