Begin at the nape of your wife’s neck and continue gently massing down to the hips.
Then begin gently moving back up the neck on the opposite side of the spine.
Incorporate both sides of the spine into the massage technique while staying clear of the spine itself.



Use your fist to gently press in and down, tiling the pelvis just slightly as you do so.
Avoid moving down far enough to involve touching the tailbone.



Use small circular motions and begin where the foot meets the calf.
Slowly work your way up to the thigh and finish where the thigh meets buttocks.
Always work from the foot up and avoid massaging the inner thigh to help relieve swelling in the legs.
