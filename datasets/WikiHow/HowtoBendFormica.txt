@summary
prepare the surface where you will be installing the formica.

@summary
measure the curved area to be covered using a cloth tape measure that can conform to the curves.

@summary
lay the formica out on a clean surface with the backing facing up.

@summary
don heat resistant work gloves, and use the heat gun to heat the formica to a temperature between 315� and 325�f (157.2� and 162.8�c) which is the temperature when the formica will become pliable.

@summary
,

@summary
apply the formica to the substrate, holding it firmly in place for a short time to allow the adhesive to attach firmly.

@summary
follow manufacturer's directions for drying time, and use a router or utility knife to remove any excess formica.

@article
 Countersink any nails or screws, and fill the holes with wood putty. Allow to dry and sand the entire surface, removing any paint or varnish. Clean thoroughly. This step is important as any imperfections, dents or high spots in the under surface can show through the Formica after installation.;
, Transfer the measurements to the Formica, don eye protection and cut, allowing an extra � inch (0.6 cm) all around for trimming.


For small jobs, you can cut the Formica with a utility knife and a metal straightedge. Work from the back and score the line deeply. Cut again, and then hit the shorter end of the Formica against a solid surface to break it off.
For big jobs with lots of cuts, use an electric saw, again working from the back. Use a fine toothed blade to prevent chipping.
 Brush a layer of adhesive on the Formica back and on the substrate where you will be applying the curved Formica. Follow manufacturer's instructions for the proper adhesive and drying times.
, Continue attaching the Formica, pulling it taut and pressing it firmly to the substrate.
