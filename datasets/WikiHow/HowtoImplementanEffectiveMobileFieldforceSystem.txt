 Don’t get fooled into engaging a non-specialist software writer.;
,,, Keep the application simple to make training easier and avoid mistakes.
 Focus on paper-heavy tasks and quick ROI.
 Mobile coverage can be patchy so opt for an occasionally connected model with a thick client that will allow your drivers to do their jobs even when they don’t have coverage.
 To achieve greater field worker acceptance, include something in the application which makes the life of the field worker easier eg. Time sheets.
 The design phase of a project is the most underestimated. It is usually more difficult to agree the requirement than to build the final application.
 Data is useless if it can’t be integrated to internal systems and external customers. Make sure that the solution provider understands how to integrate to your systems.
