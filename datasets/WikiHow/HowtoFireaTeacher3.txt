@summary
provide the teacher a chance to present their side.teachers are protected by procedural due process, which essentially means that after the dismissal has been served and an explanation provided, they have the right to tell their side of the story.
@article
 The teacher’s file should be submitted with the proposal.


The file should include every piece of relevant information or evidence that’s been collected.
To terminate a teacher, usually one of the following must be proven: immoral conduct, incompetence, neglect of duty, substantial noncompliance with school laws, conviction of a crime, insubordination, fraud or misrepresentation., The United States Supreme Court case of Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill provided the basic standard for how this is to be done. A teacher with tenure must be given verbal or written notice of their dismissal. All of the charges against the teacher must be revealed, along with any evidence gathered.


The employer is also expected to explain the evidence and why it is grounds for dismissal., It must be made clear that they have the opportunity to do this, with the understanding that they will be heard.


In most cases, the teacher will still be dismissed.
