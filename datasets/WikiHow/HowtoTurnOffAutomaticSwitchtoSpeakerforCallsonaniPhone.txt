,,, If you previously changed your default call audio setting to "Speaker", you can change it back here.
 This menu has three audio output selections:



Automatic - Defaults to your earpiece for calls and speakerphone for FaceTime.

Bluetooth Headset - Defaults to a Bluetooth receiver.

Speaker - Defaults to the speakerphone. This option should currently have a checkmark next to it.
If "Speaker" doesn't have a checkmark next to it, you may be encountering other problems with your phone. Try changing the setting to a different option (e.g., "Bluetooth Headset"), restarting your phone, and changing it back to "Automatic" for good measure.
 Doing this will disable your speakerphone for calls by default, though you can enable the speakerphone manually.


If you have a Bluetooth receiver you'd rather use by default, you can check Bluetooth Headset instead.
