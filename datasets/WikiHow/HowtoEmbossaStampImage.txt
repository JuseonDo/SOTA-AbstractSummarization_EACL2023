 It's a good idea to also lay down a square of thick cardboard that can be picked up to allow for easy return of the unused embossing powder.
 You'll also need to choose the ink color and get the stamp pad ready., Remove the lid from its container and set to one side in readiness for grabbing.,, Be generous with the amount, although not so much as to cause smudging.,, Quickly but carefully sprinkle the powder over the surface of the image. The wet ink will cause the embossing powder to stick to the image outline., Gently shake off the excess embossing powder onto the cardboard square. This can be carefully funneled back into the container for reuse., This is simply to create adequate heat to heat the image., Hold it over the pre-heated toaster., It should form a smooth, unbroken surface following the outline of the image., The design is now permanent. It can be used for making cards, in paper craft projects or for display.
