@summary
fold another piece of magazine paper as you did before.

@summary
continue folding magazine pages, gluing them, wrapping them around the spiral and taping the end until you think you reach the size of the bowl you want.

@summary
pull up on the sides of the spiral to form a bowl shape.

@summary

 Try to cut as evenly as is possible. You may want to use a razor blade or just tear with your hands.;
, You will need a good amount of quality glue sticks to create your bowl.
 Fold both sides lengthwise into the center crease. Fold them into the center again, until you have a sturdy but skinny strip of magazine paper.
 Carefully roll the strip from 1 end to the other until it forms a spiral. Use a small strip of invisible tape to secure the roll.
 Apply glue to it and tape the end lightly to the end of the last piece of magazine paper. Wrap it around the spiral and tape it at the end.
 Many people aim for 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm).
 Gently pull while the glue is still wet so that it is easy to maneuver. It should pull up to form a bowl that is 2 to 8 inches deep (5 to 25 cm), depending upon how big your bowl is.
 This is an optional step, but it will make the magazine pages shiny and hold them in place. Place the bowl in your home as a decoration or use it to hold stray coins or keys.
