@article
 In doing so, you are maximizing warm up time and you will also have enough time to watch a few competitors before your go.;
, Use this time to your advantage.
 You must take and wear anything that you will be using, (Helmet, spurs, jodhpurs, shirt, boots and a crop if you use one). Many people ask to borrow yours as they may have forgotten there's, don't do this as if you don't have yours with you, you may get disqualified.
 Many riders will begin at the first jump, but if you start at the start line, you can figure out the best approach for your first obstacle, therefore setting up the whole round.
 However, do not walk over it, as this is cause for elimination. Remember where you met the jump, walk around and place your heel against the other side of the jump. As you walk towards the first jump, memorise the strides twice.
 As you walk and stride the course out, make sure you continuously look back upon the course you have already walked, this makes it stick firmer into your memory.
,, Step each jump out as though you would on your horse, as even if you take the whole 15 minutes (or time allowed to walk the course) don't worry, you will be more prepared than the rider who didn't even walk the course)

,, It is best to do a warm up lap of the jumps when the judge rings the bell, after the bell, you have 45 seconds to start the course. Follow the lines you memorized and as you jump each jump look towards the next one and keep record of the obstacle you just negotiated.
 If you are totally lost, dismiss your self,, but not prior to giving the course a second go. Even if its wrong, you will have jumped, which is better than not trying at all.
