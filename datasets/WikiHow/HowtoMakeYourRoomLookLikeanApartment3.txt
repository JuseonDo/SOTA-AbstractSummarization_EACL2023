 Set up a coat rack and a shoe rack. Remember to have storage for the costs and shoes of your visitors, as well as your own.
 Have one that says welcome if you like. Make sure that it doesn't impede the door opening and closing.
 Don't leave your mobile phone on this table, that won't make your room look like an apartment at all. You can put anything else you liked on the table, keys, a vase, loose change, etc. Add what is usually on a hall table.
 You may have a mirror in your bedroom area or bathroom area too but nothing is stopping you from putting one in your fake hall too.
