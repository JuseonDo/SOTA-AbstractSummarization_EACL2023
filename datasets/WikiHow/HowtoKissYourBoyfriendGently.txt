 If you break the "touch barrier," he'll feel more inclined to take things a step further. If he reacts negatively to you touching his hands, he might be sensitive, nervous, or just not ready. Watch and learn from his reactions.;
, Make him feel comfortable and confident. Don't invade his space or his privacy. It just makes things uncomfortable and awkward.
 Look at him sincerely. If he returns the gaze, he wants to kiss you, too. Look from his eyes to his lips slowly and lean in.
 If he pulls back, stop.
 Notice the key word here is GENTLY. No rough movements- it's awkward.
 If he leans back in after you both pulled away a bit, then he wants to kiss you again. Go with it, but if he goes too far let him know. Press lightly on his chest to get him to let off, and tell him you're not comfortable.
