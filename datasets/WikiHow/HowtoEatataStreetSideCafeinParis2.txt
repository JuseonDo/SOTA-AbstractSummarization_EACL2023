French restaurant service is generally more formal than in other parts of the world. It is considered rude to be too casual with a server or to snap or clap at them.
 Although the food at a Paris cafe is generally standard French cuisine, it is best to sample whatever might be especially good at a particular cafe.
 The French restaurant experience is just as much about watching people and enjoying conversation as it is about the food and drinks.
 A French server will generally not bring the check over until you specifically ask for it.
 A 15 percent gratuity is included in all checks in Paris, so any extra change you include is considered a comment on whether the service was above average
