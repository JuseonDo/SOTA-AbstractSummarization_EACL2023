@summary
know that the s-bus network can be achieved by 4 wires only:data + data- gnd +24

@summary
those 4 wires can be used from any type of data cable, cat5, cat6, or any other.

@summary
prepare your tools.

@summary
consider your options.

@summary
understand that s-bus g4 devices are rail mountable devices, and they are also equipped with two connectors on both sides that enable multiple devices to be cascaded in a train like manner on the rail.

@summary
know that, to achieve the network between the s-bus devices, you need only 4 wires, two wires for supplying the power to the device (+24 & gnd) and another two wires for data transfer between devices (d+ & d-).

@summary
know that the dimmer is device that controls light, with the ability to dim any dimmable lights.

@summary
,

@summary
understand that light circuits run with two wires always, the line and the neutral, the hot and the cold, the phase and the black.

@summary
realize that smart bus g4 dimmers accept both 220 and 110 ac power input.

@summary
take into consideration what type of dimmer are you using.

@summary
keep this check-list in mind:

@summary
dimmers channels load handling.

@summary
consider an example:

@summary
in the picture we have four channels dimmer, meaning the maximum load that can be connected to each channel is 3 amps.

@summary
know that, for extra protection, an external fuse is preferred to be connected ahead of each channel to protect against overload, shorts, electrical sharks and other common electrical issues.see that the simple buttons on the surface of the dimmer will act as manual switch to turn the lights on and off.after the bus is connected, now you can control those channels and dim it using other devices like the ddp or an apple device using the g4 ios application.refer to the programming manual for dimmer â€“ ddp for more information on how to program it.

@summary
keep in mind the device specific wiring for relays.

, You will only need a small screwdriver and a cutter, to install the entire S-BUS G4 system., There are three methods of connecting one device to the S-BUS network:

Cascading Train DIN-Rail. (Not all devices)
Using the conventional S-BUS ports. (All devices)
Using the 4D connector to join lines. (Not all devices)

,

Note that left hand side of the device has a male connector, and the right hand side has female connector.


 







This is all along the side with the traditional S-BUS connection port for extra flexibility for wiring and connection.
All these ports, the Train Male and Female + the traditional ports are actually looped in the device, meaning where ever the wire is connected it will be looped to the other port.











Of course, the female connector can be reached from far devices, not only cascading on a rail, and that is done using the 4D connector show Figure 7.



This means that you can use a normal CAT5 cable that has 4 pairs, where you need only two pairs and the others stays as extras.
, Different terminologies used worldwide to the same concept.
 As shown, it has three ports for N, which are only looped neutral connector for extra flexibility when installing, and one port for power phase line in. The power going in the Dimmer is distributed to the output channels. This fact leads to the measurements required before connecting lighting circuits to Dimmers.
 There are types available:

One channel Dimmer, Handles up to 12 Amps load - around 2600 Watts. (1ch12amps)
Two channels Dimmer, each handles up to 6 Amps load - around 1320 Watts (2ch6amps)
Four channels Dimmer, each handles up to 3 Amps load - around 660 Watts (4ch3amps)
Six Channels Dimmer, each handles up to 2 Amps load - around 440 Watts (6ch2amps)
Eight Channels Dimmer, each handles up to 1.5 Amps load - around 330 Watts (6ch2amps)
Twelve channels Dimmer, each handles up to 1 Amps load - around 220 Watts(12ch1amps)

,
Dimmers Input load handling.
Electrical breaker load handling.
 Refer to your electrical circuit installer and bulb supplier to determine how much each circuit load before connecting.


Since it is distributed load, it means that all the channels loads will be on the one electrical wire that is used in the input L port of the Dimmer, reviewing all S-BUS G4 Dimmers, all load supply would be 12 amps in sum.
Usually, a 1.5 to 2.0 mm electrical wire is enough and okay for this kind of load.
Another thing to consider is the breaker that is used in the main electrical DB should be able to handle 12 amps or more. Refer to the electrical installer to determine the breakers and other fixture specifications in accordance to the load that will be installed.

The Relay is a Pass-Through device, whatever is in, it will be out.






In the figure above, it shows different types of Relay related control. For the lighting no need for the Neutral connection, you just need to connect the main line through the relay, and the relay will handle it ON/OFF.
Since it is a pass through device, you can connect any kind of Switching control device like, Dry contact application that would open a motor gate for example.
