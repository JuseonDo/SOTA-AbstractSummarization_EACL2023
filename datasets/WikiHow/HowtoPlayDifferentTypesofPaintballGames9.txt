Pick a players name out of the container.
Understand that no players can reveal whose name they received. (It would be to your disadvantage anyway.)

Think like there is every man for himself.



Don't shoot at anybody whose name you did not draw.
Try to hunt down your player as quickly as possibly while watching out for other players that may be hunting you.
Never trust anybody; treat everybody as if they are hunting you.



Keep in mind that the player that shot you then receives the players name who you were hunting. That player then proceeds in trying to eliminate the player that you were hunting for.
Keep in mind that once a player is shot they keep all the names of the players who they have already eliminated. (e.g. Player A shoots player B and is now hunting for player C. Player D than shoots player A. Player D only receives C's card and player A leaves the field with player B's card)

Be aware that because you are the last man standing doesn't mean that you have won the game.
