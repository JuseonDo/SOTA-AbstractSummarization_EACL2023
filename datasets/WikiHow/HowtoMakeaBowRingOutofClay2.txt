 It should be a square. Use a plastic knife in cutting.;
, You want to make the clay easy to mold on. This kind of clay can be a little hard.
 Roll it on a flat surface.
 The length of it should be the same as your 3 fingers. This would be enough for your hand.
 Make it a little thin. It should maintain the oval shape. Use anything for rolling. Avoid rolling to much or else the clay might stick to the surface and it may be destroyed when removed.
 Remove it gently. You want the clay to maintain its shape.
 Afterwards, push them.
 Use something a little sharp. Don't make a hole in it. Just push it.
 This will create a ribbon effect.
 This clay should be smaller than the square that you used before.
 Kinda like a worm shape. Make it a little wide. Wide enough to fit the center of the ribbon.
 Cut the excess.
