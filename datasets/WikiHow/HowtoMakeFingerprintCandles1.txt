 This is where your child will work. Use a comfortable spot at the kitchen table, workroom––or even outdoors if the day is nice.


Always cover the surface before working. Since your child will be creating his or her design on the tissue paper, the paint will eventually soak through onto the surface.

, You may want to use a small amount of clear tape on each side of the tissue to avoid having it slide around the table. Your child will create the artwork directly on the tissue paper, which will be wrapped around the candle and placed under heat to transfer the design.


Make sure the tissue paper is the same size as the candle. Test it by wrapping it around the candle and cutting to size if it isn’t an exact fit.
 Also, provide clear water to wash brushes and hands. It might be easier to transfer the paint to smaller, separate bowls.
 The print could double as flower petals, animal heads (or bodies), stick figure people or other designs. It can help guide the fingerprinting if you draw a design outline first––nothing too fancy, and be prepared to be flexible and incorporate changes your child makes.
 Depending on your child’s age, he or she could work independently too.


Keep a clean towel or paper towels on hand to wipe excess paint from your child’s fingers should the project become a little messy.
 Add the fingerprints first and then paint around them and/or create designs such as animals or flowers, following the design you planned earlier.


Use a paint pen to mark the occasion such as, “Happy Birthday Grandma 2013!”, or add your child’s name.
