 The trick is to keep them all to an even size and not too large. Suggested width of your pancakes is 15cm (6 inches), and of a good thickness. Allow to cool.
, Add a new pancake on the top.
 Continue until you have a steady and reasonably tall stack. A reasonable sandwich stack will consist of about 4-6 pancakes. If it's too high, it risks toppling and is a whole lot harder to eat.
