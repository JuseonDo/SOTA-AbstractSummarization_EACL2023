 EPS clues investors and potential investors in to a company's profitability.A higher EPS generally signals a more robust company, profit-wise. Like most numbers, however, EPS should not be looked at in isolation. There's no fixed EPS number above which a company's stock should be bought and below which its stock should be sold. It's important to look at a company's EPS in relation to other companies.
 (A huge company generating $1M net income isn't very impressive; a tiny company generating $1M net income is.) EPS is also integral in evaluating a company's Price to Earnings ratio, or P/E.
 EPS will tell you how one company is doing compared to another, or how one company is doing in relation to the industry as a whole, but it won't tell you at a glance whether it's a steal to invest in a company or whether that company is overvalued. In order to make an informed decision about whether to invest in a company's stock, you'll also need to consider the following, at the very least:


Market capitalization
Share price
Dividends/buybacks
Long-term financial outlook
Sufficient liquidity
