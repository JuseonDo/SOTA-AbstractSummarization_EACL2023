 His son wants a Keaton Mask as a gift, but the guard is too busy guarding Death Mountain. Say yes and head over to Castle Town.;
, This will make it easier for you to sell the masks. Then talk to the Happy Mask Salesman and take the Keaton Mask.
 He will pay you some Rupees for the mask. Return back to the Happy Mask Salesman's shop to pay back the Rupees you owe him.



Take the Skull Mask and bring it to the lonesome skull kid in the Lost Woods.
Take the Spooky Mask and bring it to the kid walking around the graveyard.
Take the Bunny Hood and bring it to a running man that is running around Lon Lon Ranch. Wait for a howling noise, then find him sitting down.
 He had now released 4 other masks that you can rent for as long as you like.
