Puree/mix on a high setting for about a minute.
After a minute, the mixture should be thicker and there should be no oil separating and floating to the top.

If there is oil still separate from the mixture, add a pinch more xanthan gum and remix in blender.
If the mixture turned out too thick, like gelatin, then too much xanthan gum was added.



Add unsweetened cocoa powder at this point if desired and blend until the powder is combined and the mixture is smooth.



Liquid sweeteners can just be added to the blender mixture and mixed.
Granulated sweeteners will need to be dissolved, so the blender mixture will need to be poured in a saucepan on medium heat. Add granulated sweetener of choice and stir in saucepan until sweetener is completely dissolved.
, This will raise the carbohydrate count of the ice cream, so be careful.



Turn off the machine and scoop the soft serve into a sealable container. Place it in the freezer or dig in if you're more of a fan of soft serve.
The ice cream should harden a bit after staying in the freezer.
