 Massage the painted parts of your hair with your fingertips to soften any hardened sections.You could also take a bath to allow your hair to soak in the warm water for several minutes.;
, No special shampoo is required – you can just use your normal product. Let the shampoo sit for about 10-20 minutes before washing off., Try to comb out the sections of paint that have now softened. You may want to clean the comb periodically with your fingers and set aside the bits of paint so that they don’t clog the drain.
 Once you’ve removed as much paint as possible, rinse your hair again in warm water. Comb your fingers through your hair to help remove any lingering bits of paint that have flaked off.
 Saturate the hair with conditioner to help restore some of its moisture. Let it sit in your hair for at least three minutes before rinsing so that your hair has a chance to soak up the conditioner’s oils.
