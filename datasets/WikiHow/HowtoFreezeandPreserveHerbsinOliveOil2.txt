 Fill approximately 2/3 of the way to the top with your herbs.
 Fill almost to the top but take care not to overfill or spill.
 Stack the trays if you are creating multiples.
 Donâ€™t leave trays in the freezer for too long as other food in the freezer may intermingle with the cubes, compromising the taste.
 Release the cubes in a clean plate or surface.
 Make sure each bag is clearly marked with the date and contents of each cube.
 Use cubes for up to 6 months or for two seasons (freeze in the summer and use for fall and winter meals).
