 More often than not, this is labeled as "Harddrive." It could also be your (C:) drive, however.
 If it is highlighted, you can also press Command + I (uppercase "i") to open the info pane.
 Once you've opened info, the amount of space should be visible as a number of Gigabytes (GB). This is the amount of space you have for files like music, movies, photos, and documents.
