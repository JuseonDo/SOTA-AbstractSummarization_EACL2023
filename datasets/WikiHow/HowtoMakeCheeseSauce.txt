, Continue to whisk even after the flour has been incorporated to ensure that the floury taste is removed. Keep the heat low.
 Whisk together slowly and continuously until the mixture breaks into a simmer.


If the butter/flour mixture is hot, add cool milk; if the latter is cool, add hot milk. Mixing the ingredients together at different temperatures ensures that they'll heat at a moderate pace and develop the optimum texture.
 You will want to make a thick and smooth sauce.
 Optionally, you could also add the diced onion, fresh cloves, or a bay leaf, but make sure you strain out any seasonings before adding the cheese.
 The more patient you are with the simmering and stirring process, the smoother your sauce will turn out to become.
 An acidic ingredient such as wine or lemon juice ensures that the cheese doesn't become stringy.Let the cheese come to room temperature to facilitate the subsequent melting process.
 Mix thoroughly. Make sure the heat is at the lowest possible setting. You may also turn the heat off and let residual heat complete the melting process of the cheese.


It's important that the cheese is not heated past what's necessary for melting, so err on the side of using less heat.
