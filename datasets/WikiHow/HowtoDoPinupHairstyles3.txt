 Use a comb to section off a chunk of hair directly above your forehead in a U shape so that you are moving in the direction of ear to ear. The open ends of the U will be in the front of your head and the curved side of the shape will point toward the crown of your head.


Pretend that you could draw a line from the edge of your eye up to your hairline and stop gathering hair for this section where the imaginary line and your hair intersect.
Clip the hair directly above your forehead.
 There should be about two to three inches of hair between the edge of the U and the Ponytail.
 Separate the section into smaller pieces.
 You want to use a one-inch iron if possible here in order to get the right size roll, but any iron that you have will work.
 Start about two inches up from the roots and comb backward.


Smooth the outside of the hair that you just teased with a smoothing comb and spray with hair spray.
 You can roll the curl straight down or roll it slightly off to the side.
,, Remember to comb backwards and smooth the outer hair with a smoothing brush when done.
 You can either leave your poofy pony as is, pin the ends underneath to create a smoother poof, or pin the ends into little ringlets for a dressier feel.
 You can either tie the bandana at the base of your head or slightly to the side on top of your head.
