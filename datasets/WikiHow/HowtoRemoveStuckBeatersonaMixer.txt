 Give this a few moments to drip down and jiggle a little. It should come loose after a little movement; wiggle it off gently in a straight line.;
, Another method is to wrap a hot towel around the shaft for 10 minutes, then pour more hot water over the towel and wrap again for another five minutes on the mixer itself to heat up the metal. Wiggle the beater off in a straight line., Regularly oil the sleeve to ensure that the beaters do not get stuck in the sleeve again. Use a food grade oil in case of drips in your ingredients.
