 Make sure they're clean and match the rest of your outfit.Slim sweatpants are big among sneaker-heads, because it's a great way to show off their kicks. If you've got a pristine pair of Jordans, put on your tailored sweats and wait for the compliments to roll in.To dress them up, skip the sneakers and go for loafers with no socks or a pair of Chukka boots., Sweatpants are the ultimate in casual wear, but to keep them from looking sloppy, try a crisp white t-shirt, a chunky cardigan, or an untucked oxford.For a low-key look, layer a flight jacket over a t-shirt and accessorize with a beanie and boots.If you're wearing a t-shirt or a henley, make sure it is clean and fitted to contrast the loose pants. Solid colors, patterns, or vintage t's can all work.



Avoid sweatpants with logos or writing.Wear a crew neck sweater over a button-down and leather trainers., Every time you step out in your sweats, you are fighting against the image that sweatpants are for slobs. If there's a stain on your pants or they're wrinkled or have holes, you're going to slide into the stereotype of looking like you don't care.
