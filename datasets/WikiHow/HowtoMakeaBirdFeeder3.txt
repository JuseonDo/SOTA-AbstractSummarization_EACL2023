,, Using two lengths of very strong cord or braided twine, wrap one cord beneath the pumpkin in one direction and wrap the second beneath the pumpkin in the opposite direction (nestling both in a groove)., Holding all four strings evenly, bring them together at least one foot above the edge of the pumpkin and tie them together.
 Hang the pumpkin by tying the strings to a tree or similar hanging point. Be sure that it is strong enough.
