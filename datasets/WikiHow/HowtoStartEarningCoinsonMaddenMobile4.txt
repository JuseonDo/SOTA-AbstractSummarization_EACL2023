 One way to grow your coins at a faster rate once you are wealthier is to wait for live events such as "Headliners" or "Team of the Week" to occur. Use up all your stamina on the event and complete their respective sets.

It is not a bad idea to spend $5 on cash to replenish stamina, but that is completely optional and not needed.
By completing their sets, you have a little jump start on the "TOTW Hero" and "Headliners Hero" sets for your next steps.
 Buy all of the players in that set (that you don't already have) for as cheap as possible, and put all of those players into the set and get your rewarded player.

Make sure that the players you buy up will be less than the profit made from selling the Hero card. (Remember the 10% fee from selling on the auction house.)
