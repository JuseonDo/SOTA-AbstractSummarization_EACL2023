@summary
begin by filling your bathtub up with some hot water.

@summary
put your ferret in.

@summary
take some ferret shampoo (about the size of a quarter) and rub onto the fur.

@summary
do not put the shampoo on their head.

@summary
once you have lather rinse it with some clean water.

@summary
after that is done, you can either put a towel on the floor or in the bathtub.
@article
 Ferrets normal body temperature is 103 Degrees so they need water just a little warmer than we would like.
 The water should come up just above her legs. Making them swim is cruel so please don’t fill it up too high. Most of them can’t swim.
 If your ferret freaks, gently put your hand on the ferret in the bath so they feel secure.
 You could get some in their eyes.
 Empty all the water and then rinse your ferret one more time with some clean water.
 Now you can watch the fun! Your ferret will rub all over the towel (and the floor too) to try to get the water off. They will do this for about 5 minutes and then you can give them a treat.
