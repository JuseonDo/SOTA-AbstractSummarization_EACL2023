 You will find that the tab is incredibly daunting and in some cases miles beyond your technical ability. Don't worry. This is how everyone feels when first confronted by some real metal music.;
, Now attempt to learn it. Do this with several songs and you will eventually build up a repertoire of riffs which you can play.
,, The more you practice, the better you get. It is hard at first, but try to angle your pick and practice with a metronome and it will eventually become much easier.
, For pinch harmonics, or "squealies", practice on the third string 4th fret and touch your thumb over the middle pickup on your guitar. It seems impossible while first learning, but it gets easier with practice. You could also try artificial harmonics or natural harmonics.
