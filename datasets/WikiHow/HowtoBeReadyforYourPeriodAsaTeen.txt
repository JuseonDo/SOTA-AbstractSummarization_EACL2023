, You may need to ask your parents and they should be fine with it because after all, it's free! Also do research. Most pad/tampon websites tell you about their products so learn which ones sound good. If you can, avoid buying pads or tampons until you have samples so that way, if they're crummy, you didn't waste any money on them.
 Some do period starter kits! They come with little bits of everything so you can figure out what's easiest and most comfortable for you!

, Also, it can be useful to carry around a spare pair of panties just in case you are caught off guard.
 When you are still irregular, it might help to wear pantyliners every day so if you start it doesn't leak through anything. Mark a calendar so you can track your days but make it private. (Maybe, a little dot on the days in your calendar so it can be discrete and useful at the same time)

, Regular panties don't give the protection needed during periods. Adira Period Panty is leak-proof, hygienic and skin-friendly.
 They will tell you that there is nothing to be afraid of. Menstruation is a normal part of growing up. Without it, us girls could never have children someday!
