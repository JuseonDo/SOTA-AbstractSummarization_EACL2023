 Smiling makes other people happy, and someone else might want to smile if you do.;
, Jokes can make someone smile really easily, as long as they're funny.
 Hugs make someone so happy they could just drop to the ground.
 If you show polite behavior, this will make others happier. For example, hold the door open for that person whenever they are trying to get in somewhere, or saying hello politely to someone when you guys meet.
 Offering a random act of kindness makes others happy!

, Some people like to say their names, and they think it's nice to know that someone cares about hearing it. This will improve your relationship with that person. Remember to tell that person your name, too.
 Someone might be in a bad mood because of the work they have to do. For example, help that person do the laundry, or help with a research paper that person has to do. If you offer a helping hand, there's a higher chance that that person will smile!

, Surprising someone to make them smile, or get over anger or a bad mood, is a great way to make their day. Try bringing gifts, such as flowers and chocolate.
 Humility shows others that you don't always think you are perfect, and it can make others happy and brighten their days. When you are humble, you are treating people better and showing kindness and mutual respect for them.
 When someone is talking to you, don't just sit and wait until they finish talking; actually listen to what they are saying. Try words that encourage the speaker to keep talking, such as "Hmm," "I see," and "and..." Show that you are truly listening and this will make others happy.
