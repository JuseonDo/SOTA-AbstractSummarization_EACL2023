 When you first begin the game, it'll be a blue portal, the basic level version. It shimmers and looks a bit like a goal hoop on its side.;
, A user interface box will pop up, showing what can be created through this portal. The very first symbol will be of a workbench.
 Tap on it and it will be surrounded by a white square.
 Your character will now start hammering away to make a workbench.
 If it doesn't, then you'll need to craft more baskets to increase the inventory size or remove something to a storage chest. Done!
