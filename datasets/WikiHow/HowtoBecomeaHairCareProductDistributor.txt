 Look for a hair care product line that you will be able to sell to the type of consumers you market to and have access to. Contact that company and ask for a distribution agreement.;
, The agreement will state that you have permission to legally distribute their goods and will act as a permit for you to sell their products.
 Many companies do offer this as it will provide the distributors with the knowledge needed to educate consumers on the product and promote sales.
 This may be a shop, hair salon, online site or even from your own home, sometimes companies will ask you about your marketing and selling intentions prior to sending you a distribution agreement, so you need to have a plan for selling the products in place.
 Keep track of any start up costs involved with distributing these hair care products, even if you already have a fully operating business. In your plan make sure to write out and identify ways of reaching the target market for the products and marketing and selling the line that you're distributing.
 Ask the company for marketing and display materials, many larger hair care product companies will provide their authorized sellers with special displays and informational packets to help promote the products. These types of promotional products will also let consumers know that you are an authorized seller of that hair care product line.
 Many hair care product companies let consumers know that their products are only guaranteed to work if they are purchased by an authorized dealer, so it is important that your consumers know you are authorized.
 The industry can be very lucrative but it may take some time for many people to really break into the industry and become successful.
