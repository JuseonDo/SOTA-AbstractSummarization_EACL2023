 In the event of an emergency, you can simply walk outside or through the lobby rather than having to find the stairs in the dark. However, some may feel more safe in a room on a higher floor, which is further out of reach from burglars, if the area is a high crime zone.



Trace your route to the fire exit and memorize it. It's always better to do it first thing when you check into your room, not when you need to evacuate in a fire.

, The less public access to your room, the better.
 Make sure you're alone by checking curtains, behind doors, closets, the bathroom, etc.
 If it doesn't, use your own padlock or at the very least, prop a sturdy chair against the door.
 Keep the curtains drawn at as well. If the breeze helps you sleep, consider bringing a small fan to put on the nightstand, or use the air conditioner.
 Never open it unless you personally know the person who is knocking. If someone claims to be sent from housekeeping, call the front desk to validate if a staff member was actually sent to your room.
 It will help make sure you find your way back, especially at night.
 Avoid leaving it locked in your car in the hotel parking lot.
