 You won't get anywhere without a positive attitude on life. Remember, lots of female rappers didn't accomplish their popularity right away.;
, Keep a composition notebook handy. This will be your "Book Of Rhymes."

, Know your favorite rappers, and look up to them. They started at the bottom, too.
 Ask them if they like to rap, who their favorites are, etc. They can help you in the long run.
 This gives you the opportunity to work on stage presence, as well as exposing your music to new people.
 In fact, utilise all types of social media, such as Twitter/Tumblr/Facebook to expand and build a rapport with your fan base.
 Ask others what they think and ask your friends to check it out. You want a fan base, yes, but you want some criticisms to help you grow in your career.
 Maybe a sibling, or a friend. Ask them for their opinion on things, and ask how they could make it better.
 Make a demo/ recording of your best freestyles and songs. You can even record high quality material at home with music software you can find online.
 Make sure to mention you're a rapper when talking to new people.
, You will get judged on your appearance as a female, so put in some thought as to what you wear. Your outfit should match your style.
