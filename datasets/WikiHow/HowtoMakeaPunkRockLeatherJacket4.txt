, Jackets look good with a little extra, and in adding all that extra stuff, why not put more on there. Just kind of jazz it up. Throw some buttons you got at a show on there, or a safety pin or two. Also, super gluing bottle caps from your favorite beer looks nice. You could really use anything on this step.
