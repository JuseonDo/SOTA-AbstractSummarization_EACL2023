,, Characters getting thrown on teams like Team 7 (usually instead of Sakura) is way too overly-used. Try not to do it! You can make you're own team! (It's usually 1 girl and 2 guys.) If you're worried about not having enough interaction with the other Naruto characters or your planned love interest, don't fret! You'll most likely be living in the same village anyway so you'll be able to see them all the time!

, How would they respond to your character? Use the answer to edit your character's profile if necessary.
 Using your OC's personality, come up with an outfit (that you can run around in, your OC's most likely a ninja, after all)!

, Nobody likes self-inserts! If you want, you can add traits from your friends, family or even enemies.
 It doesn't have to be perfect!
