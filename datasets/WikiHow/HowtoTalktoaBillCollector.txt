 You can compare your figures against theirs and will be able to detect any discrepancies in dates, balances owed or payment amounts.;
, Know what you can afford ahead of time so you have a good idea of whether a proposed settlement will work for your budget. It will also prevent being pressured into a payment amount you can't afford.
 Avoid getting angry or crying when you talk to bill collectors. They have no right to harass you or make you feel bad and could be using this tactic to pressure you into paying more than you legally have to pay. Take a deep breath and remain neutral. Ask to talk to a supervisor if the collector continues to be rude or unprofessional.
 Let the bill collectors do most of the talking so they clarify everything about the account in question and outline everything clearly. You'll be able to figure out exactly what's being required of you without revealing more about your financial status than needed.
 Collection agencies are required to give you a statement of balances, payment arrangements and account information. Having this contract in print will guarantee that the debt collection agency follows the payment arrangement as stated.
 Knowing they're being taped will ensure the collectors behave professionally and will provide you with documentation of your payment arrangements in case they're questioned.
