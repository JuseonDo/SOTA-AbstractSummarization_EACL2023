, This is where you will record the date of each transaction., Most general ledgers call these Journal Entries.

Include column headings such as Properties Sold, Properties Purchased and Properties Listed, with the prices that each property is listed and sold for. This will keep you organized and able to see what kind of listings you are managing, closing and earning money from.


Record all of your sales commissions. Note the total commission paid, and whether you earned the whole commission or split it with another agent, broker or company.
 This is where you can record any money you are holding in escrow for a buyer who has made an offer on a property.,

Use MLS listing numbers, the property address or the name of the seller or owner.


Use a highlighter when a property is closed and the deal settled. Or, set up separate pages or tabs for open and closed properties.
 By keeping up with your ledger, you will avoid forgetting to record transactions or putting in the wrong information.
