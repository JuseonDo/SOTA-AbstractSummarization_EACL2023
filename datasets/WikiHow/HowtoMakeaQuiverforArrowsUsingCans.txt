 Remove top using a can opener.;
, Drill several 1/8” inch holes in the bottom. These are the quivers rain drains.
 Fill the can with foam up to 2 inches (5cm). Use mattress foam or stuff with a small towel. This is the quiver's noise reducer and tip protection.
 Remove tops and bottoms of each can using a can opener. Save the removed lids, as you can use the lids to make arrow heads from later.
 Glue them together one on top of the other. Add a thin ¼” thick foam rim on the top can (door/window foam works perfectly). This is the quiver's noise reducer.

This is your base.
 Alternatively, paint it using a primer.
 If needed, make adjustments.
, add a pouch to hold extra glue, arrowheads and feathers.
 The arrow quiver is now ready for use.
