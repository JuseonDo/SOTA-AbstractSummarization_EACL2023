 Put the pieces aside in an unheated frying pan.;
,, Set a timer for 10 minutes. However, the best test to tell when the pasta is ready is to eat a piece––it's ready when it no longer has any grit or crunch, but still has some resistance when bitten.
 Add some crushed garlic cloves if you wish to.
 Adjust the heat as necessary to render fat out of the bacon, but avoid cooking the bacon to the crispy stage––you really want it soft and just slightly browned.


Timing is critical––you should be able to have the bacon cooked in the 10 minutes it takes to cook the pasta––you may need to lower the heat to keep the bacon hot. Do not allow the pasta and pot/ pan to go cold waiting for the bacon to cook, as this will leave the egg uncooked.
 Shake quickly to remove excess water. Do not rinse the pasta and return it to the hot pot you originally used to boil it in.
, The eggs will cook from the heat of the bacon fat and hot pasta (and the hot pot).
 The cheese will melt from the heat of the bacon and pot.


If desired, you may add a splash of cream to improve the richness of the dish.
 Stir in, until the pasta mixture is speckled with pepper. You could use around a tablespoon of coarsely ground pepper although as the cook, you could add more or less to your personal taste.
 The combination of Parmesan cheese and pepper make this a wonderful dish. It can be served as a side or main dish (depending on serving size).
