@article
 Are you taking a picture of your friend on the beach or the beach with people/friends on it.;
, Don't take a picture of the hallway with your pet in it (unless that is vital to the 'story' of the picture). Take a picture of your pet.
 While most shots are better shot horizontal, there are some shots that just look better vertical.
 Lay on your back and shoot up into the trees. A boring shot can be greatly improved just by changing the perspective of the shot. Get on the ground and shoot from your pet's view.
 There might be times when it adds to the shot, but be careful.
, Not just frame your shots, but look for frames within the shot. That helps you to define your subject and get your point across quite often.
 Don't over-complicate your photo. If your shot is too busy, then you will never be able to identify the subject later on, when you are further away from when you took the shot.
 It is very easy to give your subject horns if you don't watch out for the tree or sign behind them. If at all possible, blur the background.
 Again, they will, quite often, identify the subject.
 If you don't think about the shot, you will spend much more time regretting what might have been.
