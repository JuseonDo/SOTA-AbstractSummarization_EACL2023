"his most annoying tactic is that when his hp goes below 50%, all attacks can only do 6999 damage (assuming your "pre-cap" damage is low enough that 6999 is 70% of your damage) at most to him, so it becomes about using combo weapons rather than damage dealers.

@summary
note that you can leave the battlefield and return with yiazmat having the same health.

@summary
after a long battle, go back to rabanastre to claim your reward.
@article
 The petitioner is Montblanc, found in Clan Hall in Rabanastre. This Ultimate mark is responsible for killing his mentor who taught him and his brothers and sisters everything they know. You are Clan Centurio's best Hunter so take revenge on this cursed Wyrm!;
, Go to the coliseum. Cast float because the field is littered with traps.
 You should have bubble belts for 9999 health. I strongly recommend the yagyu dark blade because it has dark element and can give a nice combo. Or you can use the Tournesol.
 If the party wanders too far, he'll start casting buffs on himself and regain tons of HP. When his HP is about at 9-10 bars left, he'll use Growing Threat to boost his damage output even further, and cast Reflectga on your party near 4-5 bars left, but it's a once per stage cast. If the player is not careful, a Renew spell could be reflected off your party, fully healing Yiazmat."

, "However, there is a round indicator in the upper right part of the screen, showing how often you fled from the battle. It has no purpose other than proving how you are doing in this fight."

, The reward is 30000 gil, and the Godslayer badge. This badge, if sold with the Omega badge and the Lu Shang badge will give you The Wyrmhero blade with 130 attack.
