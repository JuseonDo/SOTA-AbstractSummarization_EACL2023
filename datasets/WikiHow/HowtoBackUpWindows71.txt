,, Microsoft recommends storing backups on hard disks separate from Windows 7, such as a CD, DVD, or external hard disk.Insert the device to which you want your backup saved, click on “Refresh” in the Backup and Restore window, then select your storage device.
 This will allow you to choose the items you want backed up on a regular basis.


Alternately, you can select “Let Windows choose.” If you select this option, Windows will not back up Program Files, items formatted with the FAT file system, items in the Recycle Bin, or temp files larger than one gigabyte.
, Otherwise, Windows will back up your data once per month by default on the date specified.
 The process may take up to several minutes to complete, based on the amount of data you want backed up. A progress bar will display on-screen to indicate the status of the backup. When the backup is complete, your backup folders and media storage will display in Windows Explorer.
 Your Windows 7 files will now be backed up.


If you set up the Backup and Restore program to run on an automatic schedule, Windows will prompt you to insert the storage media at the time of the next scheduled backup.
