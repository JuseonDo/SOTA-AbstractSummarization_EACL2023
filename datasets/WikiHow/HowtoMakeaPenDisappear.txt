 The pen has to have one of those clip-on things on the lid. Sharpie pens work best.;
, Some offices have elastic bands, one, which are equivalent to 3 normal red elastic bands.
 Clip it to your shoulder, but not through the skin! Wear just a normal t-shirt and stick it through.
,, (To do the trick, you stretch the elastic band from your shoulder to your hand so it would look like you're holding the pen normally, and to make it disappear, simply let go! Oh, and maybe make a little gap between your skin and the sleeve, but not a too obvious one)
