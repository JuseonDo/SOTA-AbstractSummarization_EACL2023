 It's ideal for a cube shape and for a gift that has a reasonable amount of "bulk".;
, Use clear tape to hold the wrapping in place. Keep the wrapping as neat and flat as possible.
 The doubling up is important to ensure that the tulle looks substantial. The amount needed will depend on the size of your gift; check if it will reach well over the top of the gift when pulled up.
 With the other hand, hold the tulle that has been brought up in the center of the top of the gift. Continue to pull up small sections of the tulle, bringing them to be held in the center. Continue working around the box until all of the tulle has been drawn into the center, held by your other hand.
 With your other hand, work around the box to arrange the folds and pleats neatly.
 Wrap it around the bunched topping of tulle. Wrap it around one more time to ensure it is securely holding the bunched up portion in place. Tie a generous bow.


More bows can be tied on with separate pieces of ribbon for a fuller look, as desired.
 Use either slanted edges or "V" shapes. This prevents fraying and provides a neater finish.
 Trim off any loose or wayward bits.
 The gift is now ready for your lucky recipient. Attach a card and it's all set.
