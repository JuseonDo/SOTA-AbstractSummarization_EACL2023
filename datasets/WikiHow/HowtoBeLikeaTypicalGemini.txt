 Geminis are always happy and gregarious. They are fun to be around and are the life of the party!!;
, Geminis rule the communication world. They love talking and are constantly chatting with people online or in person.
 Geminis are known to be witty and sarcastic though their sarcasm can hurt other people. Try cracking witty, humorous jokes with slight sarcasm.
 Geminis are always involved in something. Keep doing something new like learning guitar or reading a new book.
 Geminis are quite intelligent. Though some might seem to be unintelligent, overall they have high IQs. If you are not especially or naturally intelligent, then you can try to learn and be well-versed on culture and issues.
 Though not all are perfectionists, Geminis have the ability to do lot of work in less time.
 This does not mean that they're not good friends, it just means that they don't spend much time with all their friends. But they are always true to their best friends/good friends. They never tell secrets and are very loyal.
 Geminis are outspoken and extroverted. They love speaking their mind, though they often don't share their deepest feelings with anyone. Geminis share their deepest thoughts with one person or two or possibly, no one.
 What this means is that they tend to be different with different people. At one time you might see them hanging around with nerds and even acting like one and some other time you will see them acting like a sorority queen.
 Geminis have very good writing and speaking skills. They are very good debaters and can write pretty well.
 Don't be overly flirtatious, but most Geminis are good flirters and are super friendly.
