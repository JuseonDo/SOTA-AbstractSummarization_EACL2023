 It'll be easier to snap the stem back if it's positioned this way.
 Once you've done that, you can continue peeling the rest of the banana downward, in one or two more strips. This is the most common way to peel a banana, so chances are that you're already familiar with it.
 Now eat your tasty banana, biting into it and peeling it back further and further until you've eaten the whole thing.
