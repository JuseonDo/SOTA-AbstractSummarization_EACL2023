 If they grow locally in your area, wait for the end of the season “canning specials” when you can get ripe fruit that you can use immediately, instead of keeping it around to eat raw.;
, They will be ripe in late summer, or sometime between July and September, depending upon the year.
 If you are worried your apricots will become overripe before you have time to dry them, you can place them in the refrigerator for up to a week. , Soak them for a few minutes in water to loosen dirt and then rinse them with running water. Discard any bruised apricots.
 You should cut them in half along the indentation, and then you can remove the pit.
 Push the outside center up, so that there is more flesh exposed to the air. You will dry them with the flesh facing up.
 If you have a large wire rack, place it above the rack to reduce drying times., Make sure they are spaced evenly apart.
 They will dry best at a warming temperature below 200 degrees (93 degrees Celsius). 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79 degrees Celsius) will work well for drying apricots.
 Place the cooking sheets with racks in the oven.
 Turn them at the halfway mark to ensure even drying. They should be slightly soft but leathery when they are done.


The cooking time will vary depending upon the size of the apricots and the temperature at which you dry them. It will take less time to dry at 175 than 150 degrees.
