 If it is under eight years old, chances are, it will be slightly tannic. If the wine is older, it won't need any aeration.;
, If you do not have a blender, you can use a food processor with a blade attachment.
 Don't worry if you see bubbles forming. This is simply the air bubbles, which will help aerate the wine.
