@summary
fit cable releases to both cameras and make a rig to hold the buttons together so that you can press them both at the same time.

 For this system you will not require a tripod, as you can hand-hold the whole rig.
, You will have to match shutter speeds and f-stops for every shot, unless you are photographing on a sunny day, in which case you can stop down to f-8, f-16 or f-22 and set the shutter speeds according to the speed of the film you are using, to provide maximum depth of field, the speed of the action you are photographing and your lenses. Both cameras must, of course, be mounted with identical lenses. You will naturally only have to look through one viewfinder, as you have, at these f-stops, focused both lenses to infinity, havenâ€™t you?
