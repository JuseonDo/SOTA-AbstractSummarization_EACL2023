 You can't look like Fionna without her awesome hat! The hat basically looks like a white hat that wraps around her head, shows only the front of her face and has bunny ears. If you want to buy one, you can order it online. But if you choose to make the hat, it would be cheaper.;
, It's a round, two-toned green backpack.
 The shirt should have elbow-length sleeves.
