 Use cardboard joined together and have a male friend or family member lie down on the cardboard. Trace around the person, then cut out the image to form the man template that will be used shortly.;
, Lay down newspaper, butcher's paper, a tarpaulin, etc., to protect the floor or ground surface from spray paint.


This location should be somewhere that is well ventilated; outdoors is even better.
 Add supports on the edges of the curtain, to keep it firmly stretched across the floor or ground.
 Make sure that the cutout is placed straight, and does not slant at all. If needed, place some weights on the template to stop if from moving or blowing away (if you're outside). The weights may get sprayed, so only use things you don't mind this happening to, such as rocks, items to be recycled, etc.
 The paint should be sprayed only lightly (spraying it too thickly will reduce the effect that you are aiming to achieve).


The cutout will prevent the area it covers from getting dyed.
,, Spray paint each of these curtains green but do not use the cardboard cutout. Now you have some plain green curtains which will help to make the scary curtain seem even scarier.
 Hang the scary curtain in one of the most prominent and easily noticeable places of the room.
 Now you will be able to see that in the dark, all the curtains glow green. The scary curtain with the man's image will give the impression of a shadow with glowing red eyes, waiting behind that curtain.
 Watch the fun as they scream.
