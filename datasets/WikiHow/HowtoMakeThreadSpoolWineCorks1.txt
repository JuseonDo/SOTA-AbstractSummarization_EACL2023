 You may want to design a cork that will match your or your gift recipient’s décor so planning the color spool and thread is something to ponder.
 Giving a set of four or six corks as a gift may be a nice display. Or if you are giving multiple gifts, take a count of the number of recipients before heading to the store.
 Thread comes in a variety of sizes, colors and textures. Examine your current supply and determine if you need to pick up new thread and whether your supply will meet your design needs.
 Either begin saving wine corks now survey your current collection. You want corks that are completely in tact with no missing pieces or stains. Typically recycled white wine corks work best (red wine corks may be stained).
 The thread and spools are the crowning design point so make sure you find thread and spools that are attractive.


Find a sharp pair of scissors and double sided clear tape.
