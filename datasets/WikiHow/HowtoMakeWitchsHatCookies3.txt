 This will become the witch's hat "brim."

, The idea is that the frosting becomes the hat band.
 Place in the middle, over the cookie hole. Allow some of the frosting to run out from underneath the kiss.
 You don't want the frosting to look "blobby" but instead clean and smooth.
 Then the witch's hat is ready to serve. Continue making as many as needed.
