You want just a light coating of oil in the bowl. If the oil is pooling in the bottom of the bowl, you have too much.
You can use cooking oil spray to get a light, even coat in the bowl.
 Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a tea towel.
 Set the bowl on a countertop or table at room temperature. Place it in an area free of drafts.


The dough should rest for a minimum of 12 hours. If you let it rest for 18 hours, you'll get the most flavorful artisan bread.
 Scrape the bread dough out of the bowl and onto the floured counter. Add just a bit of flour to the top of the artisan bread dough.
 The dough will be very sticky at this point. Use the scraper to help you fold the bread.
 You can also cover the dough with the inverted mixing bowl. Letting the dough rest for 15 minutes will make it easier to shape.



Don't worry too much about making the ball perfect in shape. It can be sloppy and jagged. The bread will straighten out once baked.
 Let the dough rest for another 2 hours.
 The oven needs to be hot when you set the dough in so that the bread will spring up and form a high loaf. Place the Dutch oven or casserole dish in the oven as it heats up, but remove it when you are ready to bake the artisan bread.
 Place the lid back on the container, and put it in the oven.
 After 30 minutes, take off the lid and continue to bake the artisan bread for another 15 minutes until it is golden brown and has an internal temperature of 190 degrees Fahrenheit (87.78 degrees Celsius).
 The loaf will weight about 24 ounces (680.39 g), and you should be able to get about 20 slices from it.
