@summary
as you climb the first rock tower, you will see two koopa troopas and a lakitu.

@summary
once you reach the section of the level littered with cannons, the only way to continue at full speed is to stay above every cannon.

@summary
after the cannons you will be required to jump four tubes with piranha plants sticking out.

@summary
the final tricky part of this level occurs after this jump.the few enemies after this point can be ignored as they do not cross your path of movement.run up the block wall and grab the flag to end this level.

 Jump over the first Koopa and the Spiny thrown by Lakitu simultaneously and then immediately slip under the 2nd approaching Koopa Troopa.
 The trick is to land on top of as many as possible, avoiding every Bullet Bill.
 Timing is of the essence to ensure clearing each jump. The third large tube is placed after a huge ravine. Land in front of the tube and slow down slightly in order to perform a “clean jump”. This is the only part of the game that requires you to slow down!

, In order to clear a sequence of Koopa Troopas, it will be necessary to run under the first and then jump quickly to land on the single cannon while instantaneously jumping the gap immediately after it. (if you have trouble with this part, you can also take the warp tube to clear all the Koopas)
