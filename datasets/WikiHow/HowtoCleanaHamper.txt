 If it is a picnic hamper, take this opportunity to re-wash everything inside it for the sake of sprucing it up.;
, Give it a good shake (tip upside down) if this can be done without harming it in any way (be careful of lid joints).
 Make sure the cleaner is turned onto a low power level - you don't want to pull the woven pieces out of their shape.
 Some may just wipe off; others may be permanent and you will only be able to lighten them a little. Picnic hampers are likely to have food stains, which really ought to be cleaned off immediately.
 This is a gentle abrasive that you should use with a soft sponge only (no steel wool or plastic scratchy pads!). Don't rub too hard or for too long. If the stain does not appear to want to lift, leave it and learn to live with it. The bicarbonate mix will have removed any odours and will help to have lightened the stain a little anyway. Wash the bicarbonate mixture off with salt water.
,, You can use salt water on wicker. Again, allow the whole hamper to dry in the outdoors.
 Re-tie any lid ties that have come loose and bend in any wicker that has escaped from the pattern. If it is a big hole, seek professional assistance if the hamper is sentimental (picnic hampers are often quite expensive and given as special gifts such as for weddings).
 If it is a clothes hamper, you can also toss bicarbonate on each layer of clothes to remove odours - the bicarbonate will assist in the washing process to ensure a very good, soft clean and is not harmful. This is especially useful during hot weather or in over-heated rooms to kill smelly sock odour!
