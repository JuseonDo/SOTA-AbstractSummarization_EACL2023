 About a pea-sized amount will do for this one-time-use lip plumper.If you can't find any lip balm or petroleum jelly, you can also use one of the following:Almond oil
Cocoa butter
Coconut oil
Olive oil
Shea butter;
, This can be a blending palette, a dish, or even a jar lid. Make sure that it is clean!, Cinnamon is naturally stimulating. It will help make your lips appear fuller by increasing blood flow to them. If you can't find any ground cinnamon, try ground ginger or cayenne pepper instead. Both have lip-plumping capabilities as well., You can do this using the back of a spoon or the flat side of a butter knife. If you have a small spatula, such as the kind used for cake decorating, you can use that instead. Keep blending and smooshing until the two are evenly combined., If you don't want to get your finger all sticky, you can apply the lip plumper using a lipstick brush or a q-tip.
 During this time, your lips will start to feel tingly.This is normal, and a sign that the lip plumper is working!, If you'd like, you can follow up with your favorite lip gloss or tinted lip balm.
