 Only buy yellow haddock if you prefer it â€” white haddock is apparently better and healthier. Try asking for the fish to be gutted, skinned and filleted, or buy it that way.

Always check out the fish carefully before buying it. A fish is fresh if there is not a bad smell and the eyes are clear and bright.
Don't buy the fish if it has a very off putting smell and the eyes are cloudy and dull.;

You could also add some herbs to the milk for extra flavour.
 Remember to keep track of time to make sure that fish doesn't overcook.

Once the fish is poached, don't throw away the remaining seasoned liquid.
 Boil the potatoes in water for 30 minutes on a medium heat.,, Place the mashed potato on top of the poached fish.,
