 If you want real scrubs, find a local store that sells them.;
, This can imitate things that a vet might have or carry around. You can also get a pretend one.
 Maybe a long white coat or jacket.
 Males don't need to worry about it, as that is normally how you see doctors.
 Make it organized well. A doctor is always organized.
 Make sure there are no wrinkles!

, A doctor is never dirty. Cut your nails, comb your hair, brush your teeth, and wash your hands daily.
 Doctors don't like passing germs. They always wear gloves to protect their patents. Find plastic gloves at a pharmacy or Dollar Tree. They are really cheap and you might already have some.
 Some doctors wear a stethoscope around their necks for fast and easy keeping. Real stethoscopes are pretty pricey, but fake, plastic, and pretend ones are a few bucks.
 Play and act like a doctor. Take some photos acting as a doctor!
