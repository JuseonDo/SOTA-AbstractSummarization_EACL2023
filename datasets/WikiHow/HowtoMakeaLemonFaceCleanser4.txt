Rosewater is great for moisturizing and toning your skin as well as treating acne., You can use store-bought lemon juice, but freshly-squeeze juice would be much better. If you are using freshly-squeezed lemon juice, be sure to strain it first so that you don't get any seeds or pulp. Lemon juice is great for treating acne and blackheads. It can also help brighten your skin., Your facial cleanser is now complete and ready to use!, The warm water will help open up the pores on your skin and make the cleanser more effective., Hold a cotton ball over the opening, then turn it upside-down and right-side up quickly., Pull the cotton ball upwards rather than downwards.
