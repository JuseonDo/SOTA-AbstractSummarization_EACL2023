remember to always warm up before any exercise.

@summary
assume a prone position on the floor or other rigid surface (preferably carpeted-more on that later) that's able to support your body weight.

@summary
make two fists and place them under yourself on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart.

@summary
raise yourself using your arms.

@summary
lower your torso to the ground until your elbows form a 90 degree angle.

@summary
raise yourself by attempting to push the ground away from you.

@summary
repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remainder of the exercise.

@summary
,

@summary
stretch the chest and shoulder muscles during your cool down cycle.

@summary
if you can't use your knuckles, it's fine to place your hands flat for beginners.

 Warming up reduces the risk of injury and gets muscles ready to do a push up. You can actually lift/push/pull/etc more if you go through a proper warm up routine as compared to diving straight into the exercises. Make sure to stretch your arms and wrists - key joints in push ups.
 Keep your feet together!

, If you are on a relatively cushioned surface, such as a carpeted floor, simply support yourself on your fists between the first and second knuckles. If you are on a less forgiving surface, consider investing in some pushup grips (they look like handles you put on the floor.) Curl your toes upward (towards your head) so that the balls of your feet touch the ground.
 At this point, your weight should be supported by your hands and the balls of your feet. Make a straight line from your head to your heels. This position is called "plank," which is used for other various exercises. This is the beginning and the end position of a single push-up.
 Keep your elbows close to your body for more resistance. Keep your head facing forward. Try to have the tip of your nose pointed directly ahead. Draw a breath as you lower yourself.
 Breathe out as you push. The power for that push will inevitably come from your shoulders and chest. The triceps (the muscle on the back side of your upper arm) are also contracted but the primary exercise for the triceps isn't the push-up. Continue the push until your arms are almost in a straight position (but not locked).
, Proper stretching and cool down routines are just as important as the warm up, but, unfortunately, are quite often overlooked.
