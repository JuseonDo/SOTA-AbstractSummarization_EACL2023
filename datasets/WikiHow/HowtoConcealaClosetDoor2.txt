 Measure a piece of plywood to be the same size as your closet door. Use a long metal straight edge as you cut with a circular saw to ensure that the edges are uniform and straight., You will need to cut 4 or 5 shelves that are 5.5 inches (14 cm) across. Cut them to the right width first, before cutting them to the right length.

Remember to use your metal straight edge after you measure your width to keep your saw blade straight.
 It will also give the bookcase more support at the bottom., You will need 2 top frame pieces and 2 side frame pieces. Once you have used up the second piece of plywood, move on to the third piece., Attach a work stop to your craft table that is exactly the shelf width away from the blade. You will pull a piece of plywood across the saw's platform and it will automatically stop at the correct measurement, avoiding shelves of different widths.

A work stop is usually drilled into a work table with screws to secure it. You can find a work stop at a hardware store. Make sure to measure the shelf's width 3 times to ensure an accurate measurement.
 Then, cut the top and bottom shelf pieces to the right length.
