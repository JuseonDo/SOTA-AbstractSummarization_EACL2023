 All you really need is a barbell, a bench and some Olympic weights, so think about whether joining a gym is really necessary.
 Don't make it too easy or you will be wasting your time.


"I only want big arms and chest, nothing else" This is not how you will workout. Your body will be completely out of proportion, accept this now. Your workout will cover the entire body, building solid strength.
 Concentrate on compound exercises which use several muscles at once; this will be faster, more effective, and more fun too.
, When squatting bring your rear end to the floor, if you aren't doing this then you are wasting your time. Also don't do ultra slow reps, do it naturally and controlled.
 use the same weight for each. Hard, boring, but effective (a lot better than pyramid)
