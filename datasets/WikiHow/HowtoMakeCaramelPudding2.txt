 Pour the milk into a saucepan and cook it over medium heat. Stir it frequently to prevent a skin from forming. When the milk starts to bubble, turn off the heat, and set the milk aside to cool.This recipe makes soft pudding that you serve in bowls. It does not have a caramelized top and you do not need to de-mold it.
 You can do this by hand or with an electric mixer. The more eggs you use, the richer your pudding will become.
 You are only adding part of the milk. This will help the ingredients blend together more smoothly.
 Stir the mixture as you pour to help everything mix together. Avoid pouring too fast, or the mixture will curdle.
 During this time, the pudding will start to thicken. As soon as it turns thick, you are ready for the next step., To help the butter melt faster, cut it into small cubes or slices first. These will give your pudding extra flavor and richness.
 Don't place hot pudding into your fridge, or you'll change the interior temperature.
 Scoop it into small serving bowls, and serve it with a spoon. You can serve it as is, or add a dollop of whipped cream on top. Refrigerate any leftovers.
