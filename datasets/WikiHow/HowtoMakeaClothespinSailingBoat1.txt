 The base of the triangle should be about 10-12cm (4-6"), the edges the same.
 Use additional small pieces of card or poster tack to wedge it into place., This is the bit that will be above the water. Slip string through this and tie a small knot to prevent the string slipping back through. Trim the string to neaten., Wrap around this round knob several times. Leave string dangling down for the next step.
