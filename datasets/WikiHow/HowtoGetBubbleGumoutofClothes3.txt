@summary
place the gum face down on a piece of cardboard.

@summary
turn the iron on medium heat.

@summary
run the iron over the side of the clothing without the gum on it.

@summary
iron the clothing until the gum sticks to the cardboard.

@summary
pull the cardboard away from the clothing.
@article
 Make sure the cardboard is on an ironing board to avoid burning any surface underneath the cardboard.
 You want the iron to loosen the gum without melting it completely, as that can make it even messier.
 You should now have the gum sandwiched between the cardboard and the iron, with the fabric of the clothing providing a barrier between the gum and the iron.
 It may take several minutes for the gum to heat up completely.
 The gum should pull off of the clothing along with the cardboard. If the gum does not pull away, continue to iron the clothing until it is soft enough to do so.
