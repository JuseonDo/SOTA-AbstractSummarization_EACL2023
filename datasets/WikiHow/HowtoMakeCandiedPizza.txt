, Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough. Make it nice and flat, however, avoid making it too flat or the pizza won't turn out well.


If you want to change the texture of the candy pizza base, add stir-ins and mix through well before rolling out. Stir-ins can include chopped marshmallow, chopped nuts, crushed cereal, crushed pretzel sticks, etc.
 When you think it has melted enough to be spread easily, take it off the stove. Scoop the fudge into a bowl. Spread out the chocolate fudge in the same manner as spreading out pizza sauce, using a soup spoon or knife.
 Every five minutes, check up to see how the candied pizza is doing. When it looks ready, take the pizza out, and let it cool for a few minutes. When you're ready, proceed to the next step.
 Heat it up in the microwave for 2-3 seconds. Take the slightly melted chocolate chips and kisses out.
 Once it's all covered with these, spread around some kisses, and then you can spread out your other candies and Oreo™ Cookies.
 Enjoy your pizza! It is now ready to eat. Slice in the same way as for a pizza and hand it around for dessert or snack time.
 Although optional, this makes a final delectable touch.
,, Zap until melted.
 Allow to set before serving.
