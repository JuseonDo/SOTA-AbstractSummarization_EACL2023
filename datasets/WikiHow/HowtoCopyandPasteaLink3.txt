 Website addresses can get really long, especially for pages buried deep in a site. Link shortener services allow you to generate a short version of a long address that can easily be texted, tweeted, or otherwise shared.
 Use the methods outlined above to copy the link you want to shorten and share.
 There are several services available for shortening links, and most work very similarly:


bit.ly
goo.gl
ow.ly
tinyurl.com

, Click the field and press Ctrl/âŒ˜ Cmd+V, or long-press and select "Paste," to paste your long link into the field on the shortener site.
 You'll be presented with a short version of the link that uses the service's format instead of the original site's.
 You can copy like you would a regular link using the methods above, or tap or click the "Copy" button that some sites display.
 Now that your shortened link has been copied, you can paste it just like you would any other link. You may want to give some context for the link, since it won't be apparent what it's for by looking at the shortened address.
