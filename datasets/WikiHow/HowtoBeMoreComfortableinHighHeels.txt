 The fit is essential. It doesn’t matter how gorgeous they are, buying a pair of shoes which is one size too small or too big is a fashion faux pas. You won’t feel or look comfortable and it’s not worth the pain. The size is just indisputable.;
, A 14 centimeter (5.5 in) is not the best choice if you are planning to go food shopping or run about all day. For a date where you are most likely to spend most of your time seated; this height is more manageable.
 Platform shoes provide comfort and height. What else could you want? However, men would prefer you in a pair of high heels.
, Moisturise them again before going to bed and if you can, for at least 5 minutes.
 Indeed, you could have problems such as ingrown toenails for example, in the future. Moreover, wearing high heels too often leads to backache.
 It sounds nearly foolish but it is our secret advice! When you purchase a pair of leather shoes that you haven’t yet worn, this is what you should do. Wear the shoes, then warm them up with you hair dryer. Keep a distance of 25 centimeter (9.8 in) minimum between your feet and the hair dryer to avoid deforming or spoiling your shoes.


After 20 seconds, the leather will be softer and you will feel more comfortable!
