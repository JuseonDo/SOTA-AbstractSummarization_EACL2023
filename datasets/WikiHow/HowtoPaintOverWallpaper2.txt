 This will help prevent the wallpaper from possibly loosening after it is painted. Make sure to use an oil-based or shellac sealer, not a water-based sealer. Water-based sealers may cause the wallpaper to loosen from its bearing, defeating the purpose of sealing.
 Make sure that no spaces exist in these areas, as paint may bleed through, covering unwanted edges and corners.
 Again, stay away from water-based primers. Once dry, give the wallpaper a light sand using fine-grit sandpaper, paying special attention to the areas where spackle or compound was applied.









Follow manufacturer instructions for application methods and drying time.
Check over walls after primer is dry for any possible damage that might have been missed earlier. If holes or tears are detected, apply spackle again and re-coat the area with primer.
 Instead of a latex-based paint, many professionals prefer using an oil-based paint for these situations, as the moisture in latex may eventually unhinge some of the wallpaper under the coat of paint.









Apply two coats of paint for best results. Wait one full day before applying the second coat, and lightly sand the first coat for best results.
 You should have a beautifully painted wall, in which the wallpaper underneath is no longer visible.
