 Again, you may want to carry objects that can restore it., Don't try to look super-rich, but looking rich is key to being very annoying., Start to beg for money or rare items., Be sure to say "please". Try to annoy the player as much as possible. Speak in 'leet', also known as 1337., Beg in the most annoying fashion then leave once you get bored., Give me money or I'll devour your femur."
