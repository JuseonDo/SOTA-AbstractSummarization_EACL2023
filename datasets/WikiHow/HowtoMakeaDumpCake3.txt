 You can use butter or cooking spray., Stir the ingredients together until they are evenly combined. Save the rest of the ground cinnamon for later.

You can use either fresh or frozen cranberries. If you are using frozen cranberries, do not thaw them. Simply toss them into the pot.You can use just about any type of apple for this recipe, but Gala, Granny Smith, and Jonagold are especially tasty., You are using just the dry cake mix. Do not add the other ingredients listed on the box, such as the eggs or water., Do not stir the cake mix into the apples. As the dump cake cooks, the cake mix will form a cobbler-like crust on top., Cut the butter into cubes first, then melt it in the microwave or in a small saucepan over the stove. Once the butter is melted, pour it over the cake mix. Once again, do not stir the butter into the cake mix., This slow-cooking process will give you an extra-moist, extra-flavorful cake. It is ready when the cake starts to bubble at the edges., Once the cake is ready, turn off the slow-cooker and pull of the lid. Let the cake cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving it. For an extra flavor, serve it with a dollop of whipped cream; you can also use vanilla ice cream instead.
