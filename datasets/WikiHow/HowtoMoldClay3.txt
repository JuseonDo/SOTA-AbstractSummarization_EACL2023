 You can mix various kinds of clay together if you find that a certain kind is too difficult to work with. For instance, add coarser clay to clay that is too sticky, or more pliable clay to another variety that is too coarse to work with.
 If you push at it with your fingertips, this can create impressions in the clay that can form air pockets as you continue to knead. These air pockets can ruin a form when you try to mold it.
 This helps to ensure that your clay is well-attached to the bat. As you shape and raise the form, take care not to spin the wheel so fast that it warps the clay. Setting an appropriate speed will also prevent your clay from flying off your wheel, ruining your project.
 To prevent this from happening, anchor your arms by holding your elbows against your knees as you work. Keep your arms firm as you shape and raise the clay.
 The goal is to keep a wet, slick surface as you mold the clay. Make sure to wet your hands before starting to mold the clay, and wet them again any time they start to become dry.
 However, you must remove the clay from your wheel or work surface and wedge it again. Knead in more clay if you need to alter its consistency (for instance, if it is too wet).
 However, you may find that various tools make molding easier, or just give you more options. For instance, using a sponge instead of just your fingers to raise clay on a wheel may allow you to make smoother or thinner sides. As you practice, don’t be afraid to experiment with all sorts of objects to help mold your clay.
