 You will need at least one sheet of watercolor paper, a set of watercolor paints with basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and black), a paintbrush, a black Sharpie and a white crayon. This is an easy and fun drawing of outer space that a young child will enjoy.;
, It will look like a very large planet that is only partly visible in the top left corner of paper.


This is much easier for kids to draw than a perfect circle.
Make sure the entire planet isn’t visible! Only the bottom part of the planet should be visible in the top corner.
 These don’t have to be perfect, so use your imagination! Put the rocket approximately in the center of the page. To create it, draw a skinny rectangle and then add a triangle on top. Then draw flames coming from the bottom of it. Next, create 3 planets of various sizes by drawing a medium circle and 2 smaller circles. They don't have to be perfect circles!


Spread the objects out over the page so that it looks full.
Add craters and rings to the planets to make them a little more interesting.
 Be sure to use a permanent marker, since regular water-based markers will bleed when the watercolor painting begins.
 You must press down very hard with the crayon if you want the stars to be visible after the background is painted black with watercolor paint.
 Choose whatever colors you want for the objects, just make sure you reserve the black paint for the background only. You could paint the large planet orange, the rocket blue, and the tiny planets red, green and purple. Any other variation works great too! Allow the paint to dry before filling in the background with black paint.If you don’t wait for the paint to dry first, the black paint will bleed into the colored objects and vice versa.
It should only take about 10 minutes to dry enough to proceed.
 The white stars drawn all over the background with crayon will show through the watercolor paint. Once complete, give the painting about 10 minutes to dry fully.
