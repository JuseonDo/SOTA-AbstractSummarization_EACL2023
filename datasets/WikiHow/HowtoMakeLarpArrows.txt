 Large box stores are a good choice, such as Walmart or Kmart.;
, A pair of vice grips work well, however, you can also cut right below the metal tip with a hacksaw.
 The shaft of the arrow might have cracked while removing the tip. To fix this problem wrap duct tape around the tip of the arrow building up the width of the tip (half an inch down) to the diameter of a penny.
 Take a penny and set it at the top of the "platform" of tape on the tip. Make a cross with duct tape and secure the penny to the tip of the arrow.
This step prevents the arrow from being able to penetrate through the tip of your padding.
 Make sure the foam is above the penny! Make sure the foam makes the arrow around 1.5 to 2" in diameter.
,, Do Not Squish the Open Cell Foam!

, Make sure about an inch or two of the open cell sticks above the closed cell. (Attach with Duct Tape)

, Also, it causes the foam to strike harder rather than compress fully. Attach the cloth cover (if you choose cloth) with duct tape or cloth tape at the bottom of the arrowhead.
