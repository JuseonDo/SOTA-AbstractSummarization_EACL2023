@summary
take your function and plug it into your graphing calculator.

@summary
look for the two points where the graphed equation crosses the x-axis.

@summary
use this graphing technique more as a way to double-check your equation, not as a way to solve it.
@article
 Your equation should be in the form of x2 + 8x + 12 = 0.
 These two points will be your zeroes, or answers to the function.
 If you're graphing an equation in order to find its zeroes and you need to show work, use this method as a way of double-checking that the answers you got were actually correct. Most teachers will not assign credit for just the answers, without the work shown.
