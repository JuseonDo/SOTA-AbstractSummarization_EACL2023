Make sure you do it in a dry and calm morning during midsummer. Because on humid days the herb produces less oil.
Harvest the herbs just after the water droplets have dried from the leaves right before the flowers open.



Do not take more the one third of the plants foliage at one time. The plant needs certain amount of foliage to re-grow well.
 You can DRY the herbs:


Group six to twelve stems and remove any foliage on the base of the stems.
Put the bundle in a cool place.
Don´t let sunlight reach it. It´s not necessary to make a package.
If you want to dry plants separate you can place them on a screen or rack.



You can use ovens, dehydrators or other appliances but the result will not be as good as the method mentioned before.
 Really simple procedure.
You can store them in a bag in the freezer until you utilize them.
 You can cover herbs like mint, basil or tarragon with vinegar or make flavored salt to preserve herbs by alternating layers of fresh herbs between salt.
When completely dry separate the brown herb from the flavored salt and store it in an airtight container.
