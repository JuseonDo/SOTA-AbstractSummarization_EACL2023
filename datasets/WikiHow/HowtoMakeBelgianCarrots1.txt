 You may cook this dish in a variety of shapes, but chunkier carrots will take longer to cook.;
, When melted, add carrots and shake until covered with the liquid.


If you wish to add ginger or nutmeg, add it to the stage you add the butter.
 Shake the pan occasionally to ensure they don't stick.


This absorption method allows the carrots to stay extra sweet and not lose any of their flavour in excess water. The trade off is care must be taken to ensure they don't dry out.
The microwave is also a decent method for this recipe, but not as good as the saucepan method as the microwave can make carrots rubbery and dry.
 Delicious with any meal.
