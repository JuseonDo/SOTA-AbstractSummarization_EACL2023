 You should be able to find stencils online and at craft stores, general stores, and toy stores.
 The stencil should be held firmly in place.


Avoid taping over any previously-painted areas, since the tape may peel away some of the dried paint.
,, Use a soft dish or painting sponge, and avoid sponges with rough "scrubber" sides. Do not allow the sponge to soak in the paint.
, Dab the sponge over the stencil until the entire design is filled in, but not solid. Do not use the sponge to rub the paint over the stencil, as doing so will ruin the texture of the finished image.
 Carefully dab the paint over the portion of the stencil that requires that color, but do not allow the color to transfer into other portions of the stencil. Use a separate sponge for each paint color instead of trying to rinse the colors off in between uses.
 Otherwise, you may smear the paint.
