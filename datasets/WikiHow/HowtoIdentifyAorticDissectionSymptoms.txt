@summary
look out for sudden, intense chest pain.sudden intense chest pain can occur in a number of serious medical conditions, including heart attacks, certain acute lung problems, and also in aortic dissection.

@summary
watch for chest pain that radiates to your back.one of the "red flag" (key) symptoms that leads doctors to suspect an aortic dissection is if your chest pain radiates through to your back.

@summary
take note if the pain spreads to other areas.while the pain of an aortic dissection often initially radiates from your chest into your back, after a while it may begin to spread elsewhere in your body (as the aortic dissection becomes worse).

@summary
notice if you feel faint, lightheaded, or dizzy.because an aortic dissection can lead to decreased blood circulating through your body (as the flow of blood is impeded to the rest of the body by the dissection), it can lead to feeling faint, lightheaded, and/or dizzy.

@summary
evaluate your pulse.because of the deceased circulation that occurs in an aortic dissection, you may also notice that your pulse becomes more rapid and weaker, typically first on the left arm.

@summary
observe for shortness of breath.this occurs particularly when lying down.

@summary
watch for pale, sweaty skin.pale skin, heavy sweating, and a feeling of anxiety and doom are common in aortic dissection.

@summary
go to the emergency room immediately.as previously mentioned, an aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that needs immediate medical attention and treatment.

@summary
have your blood pressure measured in both arms.one of the key signs of a possible aortic dissection is having a significant difference in blood pressure between one of your arms and the other.

@summary
receive blood tests.another thing that will happen when you arrive in the emergency room is that you will be given blood tests.

@summary
get an electrocardiogram and/or ongoing cardiac monitoring.

@summary
opt for medical imaging.the only definitive way to diagnose an aortic dissection is via an imaging test such as a ct scan or mra (magnetic resonance angiogram).

@summary
ask your doctor for medications to control your symptoms.if you are indeed diagnosed with an aortic dissection, you will be given medications (such as narcotics like morphine) for pain control.

@summary
have surgery if needed.if you are experiencing an aortic dissection, you may need emergency surgery to save your life.

 If you are experiencing severe chest pain, go to your local Emergency Room immediately.


It may be a sign of an aortic dissection, which is a life-threatening condition that needs immediate emergency medical attention.
Even if it is not an aortic dissection, severe chest pain may be another medical emergency (such as a heart attack or a blood clot in your lung, among other things) so it is key to receive professional medical attention immediately.
Ask a friend or family member to drive you straight to the Emergency Room, or call 911 to have an ambulance bring you there.;
, It is most often felt as an intense "ripping" sensation, and frequently correlates to aortic dissection.


However, imaging tests will need to be done to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection.
Aortic dissection cannot be diagnosed on pain symptoms alone.
 It may radiate to your shoulder(s), your neck, your jaw, and down your arms and legs as the condition progresses.


It is important to tell your doctor and the triage nurse, when you get to the Emergency Room, how the pain began and how it has progressed since its onset.
Characterizing the pain in as much detail as possible is very helpful to your doctor in diagnosing aortic dissection.
 This is because your decreased flow through the aorta means that you may be getting less blood flow to your brain, which is responsible for the onset of these symptoms.
 You can evaluate your pulse by placing two fingers on your wrist, between your thumb and first finger.


A normal heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. If your pulse exceeds 100 beats per minute, it is elevated and may be one of the symptoms of an aortic dissection.
For more information on how to check your pulse, click here.
 If you are experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, go to the Emergency Room immediately as it may be a symptom of aortic dissection or many other serious medical problems.
 This is because your body can sense that you are losing blood through the tear in your aorta, and the decreased blood flow triggers your sympathetic nervous system (your "fight or flight" response) to kick in. You may also become nauseous, and/or vomit.
 A delay in going into the Emergency Room (if you are having symptoms suspicious of an aortic dissection), could quite literally cost you your life. Call 911 for an ambulance to transport you there if needed.
 When you arrive in the Emergency Department, one of the first things your doctor will measure is your blood pressure (in both arms), in order to assess your risk for having an aortic dissection.
 The purpose is to rule out other conditions such as a heart attack (which can be detected by measuring troponin levels in your blood), or a pulmonary embolism (which can be assessed for by measuring D-dimer levels in your blood). In some cases the aortic dissection can weaken the arterial wall, leading to rupture of the artery and blood loss that will manifest as an acute blood loss anemia.


There are no definitive blood tests that "rule in" an aortic dissection.
However, if other conditions (such as a heart attack or a pulmonary embolism) are ruled out, it means that the likelihood that you are having an aortic dissection becomes comparatively higher.
 When you arrive in the Emergency Room, the doctors will also hook you up immediately to cardiac monitoring. They will set you up to receive an ECG - an electrocardiogram, which is sensitive enough to look for ischemia to the heart.


Ongoing cardiac monitoring is basically a way to continually keep tabs on your vital signs (such as your heart rate) as well as providing continual ECG tracings of your heart rhythm.
Cardiac monitoring and/or an ECG can provide information as to the stress on your heart and cardiovascular system, and can further help to rule out other conditions such as a heart attack or pulmonary embolism.
 A TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram - which is basically an ultrasound probe that is inserted into your esophagus to provide the clearest view of the heart and surrounding structures) may also be used to aid in diagnosis.


In some cases, an angiography may be performed.For this procedure, a dye is injected into your heart's blood vessels and X-rays are taken to reveal details about your blood vessels., You will likely also be given medications to control your blood pressure, as this helps to keep the damage from the aortic dissection minimized as much as possible.
 It depends upon the type and extent of your dissection. Some types can be controlled with medications alone; however, some require immediate surgical intervention to prevent a life-threatening bleed.


The doctors in the Emergency Room will be able to tell you which category you fall into.
If surgery is needed, you may be sent straight to an OR (operating room) without needing to wait due to the urgent nature of the procedure.
