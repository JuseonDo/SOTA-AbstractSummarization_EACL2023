 Small particles can collect on the toner cartridges and other components, which can significantly interfere with the print quality of a laser printer.;
, Toner cartridges are easily damaged and should remain level at all times. Handle toner cartridges as directed by the manufacturer and as sparingly as possible to ensure optimum quality.
 The higher the resolution or "dots-per-inch"(dpi) of the original file, the better the quality of the final product.


Avoid using images or graphics that have been reduced in size for file storage concerns.
 Both of these features can typically be accessed from the "Print" menu. Dpi settings can range between 72 dpi and 2400 dpi. Choose the highest dpi setting available for best results when using a laser printer.
 Refer to the product documentation to determine the recommended paper thickness. Laser printers are pre-calibrated to use a specific type and thickness of paper. Using the wrong type of paper can affect the color saturation and reduce the print quality of projects.
 The printer speed settings can have a significant impact on color saturation. Printing speed generally ranges between 5 and 20 pages per minute (ppm).


Raise the print speed settings on a laser printer when color saturation is too high, and lower them slightly when images or documents seem under saturated or faded.
 Thermal stress can reduce the quality of documents and images printed on a laser printer.


Ensure the printer is not set up next to computer towers, CRT monitors and other devices that may radiate heat and affect the print quality.
 Situate the printer in a cool, dry place. Make sure it is located away from windows or other possible sources of water vapor and humidity.
 Outdated drivers and firmware updates also can affect the quality of projects printed from a laser printer.


Navigate to the manufacturer's support and downloads page to download and install the latest drivers and firmware updates available for your printer.
