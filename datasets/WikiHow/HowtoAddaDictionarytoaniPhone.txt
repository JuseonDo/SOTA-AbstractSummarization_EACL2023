,,, You will see a checkmark on the left side. This means you have added this dictionary to your iPhone.


When you add a dictionary, it is automatically enabled in your AutoCorrect. This means your iPhone will now correct your spelling mistakes if you write a word using your new dictionary's spelling.
You can also delete any dictionary by tapping on it. The checkmark will disappear when the dictionary is deleted.



Note that you can tap on words you type, and words you come across in your internet browser, but not on words in your device's interface. This means you cannot tap on words in apps such as Messages, Calendar, and third-party applications.

Earlier versions of iOS use Define instead of Look Up.
 You will see a dictionary entry for every dictionary you've added that includes the word you're looking up. Tapping on a dictionary entry will show you the full definition in the dictionary you tap on.
