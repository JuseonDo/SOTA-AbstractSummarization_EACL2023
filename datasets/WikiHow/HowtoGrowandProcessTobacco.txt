 You could grow them from seed yourself, but in all honesty, the tobacco seeds are almost microscopic and they are difficult to germinate successfully. Get some starter plants off eBay or something.;
,,, Place the plants in each row no less than two feet apart.
 You may need to fertilize, but keep the chemicals to a minimum.
 The flower is where seeds are produced and leaving the flower on the plant will stunt it's growth. You must remove the flower.


After about four months of growing, your plants should be mature.
 You can stake them upside down in a traditional fashion and leave them to dry like that in the sun for a few days, but I did not. I washed mine and hung them upside down in my garage where it was about 80 degrees. I left them hanging for about two months until they turned golden brown.
 The top leaves are supposedly the sweetest with the lower leaves being harsher. I discard the lowest row of leaves, but I believe this to be personal preference.
 The leaves will be flaked once processed. The tobacco may or may not smell like the tobacco you are accustomed to buying from the store, but it is still tobacco and it smokes great.
 You can expect to get about one half of a coffee container per plant.
