@article
 (28.35 ml) of semisweet chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Start the time for 1 minute. Remove and stir with a heatproof spatula until melted pieces blend with any chunks still left. If needed, return to microwave for an additional 30 seconds. Repeat as needed only until chocolate is melted. If you melt the chocolate too much it will harden faster and not be as easy to use.;
, Scrape any remaining syrup from the measuring cup and around the edges of the bowl as you mix the ingredients.
 Pour mixture onto one end of the wrap. Fold the other ends in to enclose chocolate. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
 The chocolate should feel like dough or pliable clay, soft to the touch but will still hold its shape.
 Also place a cookie sheet on the counter with another piece of wax paper on top.
 Try to use mostly the tips of your fingers since the palms of your hands are the warmest part and the heat can make the clay too soft.
 Place on 1 end of the wax covered cookie sheet.
 Using a butter knife, flatten the clay and spread it out to desired size. The middle of the chocolate clay strip and 1 edge should be thicker than the rest. Remove the clay from the paper with the edge of the knife so that you have a flat piece of chocolate.
 This should resemble the bud in the center of a rose. Gently press back a little of the top of the clay petal.
 Press back the top edges of the petal.
 Proceed to circle around the other petals with 10 more sections of the chocolate clay. Press back top edges of the petals until the clay resembles a chocolate rose in full bloom.
 This excess can be added back to the molding clay to make more petals. Set finished roses on the waxed cookie sheet to harden.
