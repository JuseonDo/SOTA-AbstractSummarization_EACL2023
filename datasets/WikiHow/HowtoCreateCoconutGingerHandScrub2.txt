 Fresh ginger must be peeled before cooking. While chopping the ginger coarsely, chop it well enough so that itâ€™s completely disbursed throughout the hand scrub.
 Cook for approximately five minutes to allow the ginger and oil to combine.
 Place a bowl underneath the strainer in order to catch the liquid. While the mixture does not have to completely cooled, it needs to be cool enough to handle.
 Blend and combine well.
 The scrub will begin to thicken and congeal.
 Screw the lid on tightly to trap the essence of the oil inside.
