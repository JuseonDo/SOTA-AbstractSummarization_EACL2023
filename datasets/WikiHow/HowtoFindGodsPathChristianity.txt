@summary
read the bible and study it daily with an open mind.

@summary
do not rebel against god's straight and narrow way: being rebellious, people may see the light, but love darkness instead; they might seek teachers who never remind them of their own ways and things that they do -- as they continue in the "wide" path to destruction.

@summary
seek the narrow path that the saints have trodden: 

@summary
"the path of the righteous is level; o upright one, you make the way of the righteous smooth..."remember, this will not be easy.

@summary
do not seek strange, wide ways, and do not seek help from strange gods .

@summary
learn, believe, repent, be baptized, and be filled with the holy spirit and confess that you are saved and have found god's path.

@summary
awaken others to the light: to believe, turn, find and continue in the path.

 To find God's path, you must take the time to familiarise yourself with his word.;

"They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways.' "Rebellions comes in many forms: if you know what is right in the eye of God, as revealed by his word in the Bible, for example, and fail to do them, it is rebellion; if you know what is wrong, and continue to do so, it is rebellion.
 God's way is narrow and few there are that find it, whereas the road to destruction is wide, and many there are that walk therein.
Also, it is written that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. To find the narrow way, you must dismiss all things that block the way.
 
"The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, who lived in the old way, because the example of his father David's earlier days (of righteousness) and did not seek the ways of Baalim ...".


Idols can come in many forms, from a golden calf, to money, to your career, etc. Nothing should come before God in priority.
 But, do not give a place to the Devil in your life to steal your seed. 
"Those (lost) along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word (seed) from their hearts (from their lives), so that they may not believe and not be saved...", God, the Holy One of Israel is found unrelenting against the ways of sin. The sinners inside and outside the church do not like to hear His Holy Commandments of perfect love and grace, and of His hatred of sin. 
"No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
