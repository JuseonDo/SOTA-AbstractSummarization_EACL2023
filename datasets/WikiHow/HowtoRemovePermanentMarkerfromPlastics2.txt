 You can find them in the cleaning department of most grocery stores. They are white and shaped like bricks. Be sure that you purchase a plain magic eraser, without any additives, such as bleach.
 This will make it easier to work with; a small amount will also go a long way.
 If the stain is particularly tough, consider using rubbing alcohol instead., Do not press too hard. It may rake anywhere between five to ten minutes before you start seeing any results.
