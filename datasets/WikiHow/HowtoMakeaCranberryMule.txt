If you do not have an alcohol shaker, simply use two glass cups that are different sizes. Put all of the ingredients into one cup and place the other cup upside down into the other. Tightly press the two cups together, and shake!;
,

If you do not have a cocktail measuring jigger, use a shot glass! 1 fluid ounce is about 1 shot glass.
,

If you do not have freshly squeezed lime juice, you can substitute the lime with 1 tablespoon of bottled lime juice.


Make sure the lid on the shaker is tightly secured.


You'll be able to tell that it's well chilled when the outside of the cocktail shaker begins to condense (fog up).
 Use a cocktail strainer to prevent ice or lime pulp from entering the drink., by slowing pouring the beer into the cocktail., Add a lime wedge to the rim of the glass or add cranberries!
