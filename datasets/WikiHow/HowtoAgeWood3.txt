 Use any hue of your choice, but it must be an acrylic paint.
 Use a generous amount to completely coat the wood. You should apply enough glue so that it appears opaque. Allow it to partially dry, until tacky.
 Brush the paint over the still tacky glue, and allow time to dry.
 It may take several hours for it to appear, after the glue and paint completely dry.
