 As you go higher, the platforms move faster back and forth and you have less time to gauge whether your jump will hit or miss a platform. It's tempting to aim for a higher platform but, by design, many platforms are just barely out of reach. Aiming for a lower platform is worth the extra time considering how long it would take to get back that lofty level.
 You of course want to set a new personal record each game but this amps up the pressure you feel to avoid mistakes and, as a result, prompts mistakes. Tell yourself that this is just a warm-up game (or two or five) and otherwise lower your expectations.
 After you lose, calmly recall exactly what happened before you crashed, died, etc. In retrospect, what could you have done to avoid that end? Started shooting earlier or from a lower platform? Jumping off the screen (left or right) to re-emerge on the opposite side so as to avoid a black hole or monster? It may take several games before you find the same scene but you'll be better prepared for it if you stay calm and try to learn from your mistake instead of going bonkers in frustration.
