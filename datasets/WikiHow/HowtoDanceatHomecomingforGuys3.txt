@summary
if you see a girl you want to dance with, approach her and ask her if she would like to dance.

@summary
put your arms on the sides of her waist and pull her so that her backside is touching you.

@summary
move from side-to-side to the beat with your knees slightly bent.

@summary
avoid the wandering hands!
@article
 If she says yes and faces her back to you, proceed to the next step. If she refuses, ask someone else.
 Again: firm, not squished.
 Avoid jerky, sudden movements-- try to be as smooth in your side-to-side movements as possible. Having your knees bent will help avoid that, but still be careful.


It can help to imagine making a infinity-symbol with your hips-- slight back and forth movements, but mostly smooth side to side motions.
Move at each beat, unless the music is too fast. Then, move every two beats.
 If she ever seems tense or uncomfortable by something you've done, ease up. If she seems really offended, apologize.
