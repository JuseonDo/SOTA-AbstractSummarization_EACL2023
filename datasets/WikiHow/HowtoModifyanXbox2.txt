, Select it and press A.
 The screen should turn black and approximately 10 seconds later, you will be greeted with an UnleashX intro screen and then an UnleashX control panel.
, If you do not backup your c:\ and your EEPROM, recovering your console if something does go wrong will be incredibly hard or even impossible.
 This will mod your system. DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR SYSTEM. Let the mod install, when it finishes you'll notice that the installation prompt and status bar have disappeared.


Because of the limited capacities of standard Microsoft memory cards, only the Evolution X and Unleash X dashboards have been included in this package. I prefer Evolution X, so select Install Evox and let Evolution X install.
 Make sure to eject your Splinter Cell game.


If everything went correctly, your Xbox should be successfully modded and you will be greeted with an Evolution X (or Unleash X) dashboard.
