 You don't want to step into a shower which jets icy water all over you.;
, If you leave them outside the shower, you will have to open the door to access them and the cold air from outside the shower will freeze you!

, While you may enjoy hot water more, it dries out your skin.
 This will keep you warm. Inhale the steam. This will keep you warm. Take your hair towel down from the rail and squeeze the water from your hair. Drape the towel over your head. This will keep any heat which could escape from your head, trapped close to your body still.
