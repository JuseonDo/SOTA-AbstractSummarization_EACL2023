 Granted, you can eat more than a fistful of most foods because the food is compacted as you chew it and the water and air escape from it. Just try to envision the entire plate of food in front of you in that small fist size stomach of yours and hopefully that will remind you to eat healthy.;
, Take the time to chew each bite and appreciate what you are eating. It takes times for the signals from your stomach to reach your brain. Listen to the signals your stomach is sending to you as you eat. If it says "I'm still hungry" eat another bite, if it says "I'm just fine" then stop eating for a while and only eat again if that signal changes back to "I'm still hungry", if it says "I'm too full" stop eating immediately.
,, When you are "just fine" stop yourself from eating by getting up and clearing your plate, or if you are in a situation where you can't do that, put your napkin on the plate to serve as a reminder that you are not eating anymore.
, Carbohydrates are converted to, and stored as, fat, if not used or burned relatively quickly.
