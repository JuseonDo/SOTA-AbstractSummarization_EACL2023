 It is important to test for the formation of a shell by pricking each walnut with a needle. Discard any walnuts on which the needle detects shell formation. It is useful to know that the shell always forms at the end that is opposite to the stalk., Place these in brine for 3 days., Place in fresh brine and leave for 7 days., Place the nuts on fruit drying racks or cake cooling racks. Leave for 24 hours to dry and blacken., Fill the jar(s) with walnuts. Pour in spiced vinegar over the walnuts (see recipe next)., Allow the walnuts to marinate for at least one month., Seal and leave to marinate at the same time as the walnuts soak in the brine.
