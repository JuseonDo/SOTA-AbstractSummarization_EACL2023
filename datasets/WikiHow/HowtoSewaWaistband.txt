 Some factors that must be considered are your waist measurement, fastening/overlapping fabric, and seam allowances. The format used here is shown below. You may alter it and adjust measurements accordingly.


Seam allowance - 1/4"
Lengthwise measurement - waist measurement + fastening space (2-3", depending on the skirt) + seam allowance x 2 + growth room (optional)
Widthwise measurement - desired result width + seam allowance;
, Also consider washing the fabric beforehand so it won't shrink.
 Shown here is cutting using a mat, ruler, and rotary cutters, but you may use any preferred method.
