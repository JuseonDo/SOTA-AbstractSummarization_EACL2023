@summary
remember that the hand formation described in this article is different than those typically taught by most karate systems.

@summary
to avoid these problems, you should use the hand formation taught in 'atemi wazi' as in judo kodokan.

@summary
to learn this hand formation, just put your hand on the table with all your fingers together.

@summary
it will resemble the vulcan greeting hand gesture first initiated by mr. spock in "star trek.",

@summary
practice striking pads to build up shock resistance in the joints of the fingers.

@article
 In those other systems either the index finger alone, as 'Ippon-nukite' (one-finger piercing hand), strikes an eye, or the index finger strikes one eye while the middle finger strikes the other eye as in 'Nihon-nukite' (two-finger piercing hand). If you strike with such a hand and miss or are blocked, you are in big trouble. You can have sprained, twisted fingers and you will not be able to make a fist.;
, In this hand formation eyes are struck with the tips of the middle finger and the ring finger. The middle finger is braced by the index finger and the ring finger is braced by the little finger. All fingers are slightly bent inward (toward the palm of the hand).



Then, with your other hand, spread its middle and ring fingers.
Try to keep your fingers from coming back together.
Then try to spread them using the muscles of your hand while helping yourself with the other hand.
Do it several times, each time with less help from the other hand.
