  This that has been taken away was never ours, and this that is ours - will never be taken away.;
, It’s good: it’s God’s. He’ll put it in the right size. He’ll fill your emptiness. Be Honest: It's OK you feel so bad. A great part of our pain is us not giving space to it, which can result in feelings of pressure and distress. Our pain asks to break free. Letting it be will enable you to let it go.
 Talk to Him about it every day. If at first you have no words, just say the same word over and over again. Sing a quiet song. If you can't even cry your heart out, just sit with Him and say nothing.
 If you're not sure, try to wait a while and think: is it beneficial? Is it safe? That said, talking to the right person can be very helpful.
 Take good care of your health and of yourself. It will help you make physical space for your pain.
 Be a human being: that’s all there is.
 Wait. It's a hard task, but a reply to all suffering is silence. When Aaron's sons died, the Bible says: "And Aaron held his peace".
, Don’t give up on it because of the circumstances.
, It's very important. Keep yourself clean and tidy.
 If you remember this and hang on for a while - this bitterness will turn into honey.
 Hug yourself in your mind. Forgive yourself. You are so wonderful. Remember: God loves you so much, and He knows what He's doing. Allow Him to love you.
