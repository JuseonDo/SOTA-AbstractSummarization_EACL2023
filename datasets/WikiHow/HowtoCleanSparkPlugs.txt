Label and number each wire with tape and its matching hole with the same number, then you could remove all of the spark plugs at once. Don't remove the wire from the distributor unless you accurately number each outlet to match the plug and its cable.;

90% strength alcohol, brake or carburetor/injector cleaner or mineral spirits are good choices that all work well when cleaning spark plugs.
 Rinse well, brush, dig out any goop with a thin wire. Use the alcohol, brake or carburetor/injector cleaner or mineral spirits to quickly displace water to dry them. Dry well.


Buy HCl available in a quite stronger liquid solution called Muriatic Acid, or Hydrochloric Acid (exact same stuff), at a hardware store, home building supply/lumberyard).Caution: Only dilute any strong acid by pouring it into water (the opposite can cause popping/splattering) of drops of strong solution.



Canned pressurized air will work well to remove tiny bits of debris if you don't have an air compressor.



This is an important step to take even when cleaning spark plugs that appear to be clean.



This extra blast of air simply eliminates any debris left on the spark plugs.



Gap the clean spark plugs to your automobile's specifications using a spark plug gap tool.



If the holes are extremely dirty, you can use the same solution to clean them that you used for your spark plugs.
 Double-check that each wire/cable is replaced onto the correct spark plug as your go.


Start your vehicle to see how well it runs now that the spark plugs are clean.
