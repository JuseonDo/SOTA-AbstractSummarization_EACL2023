while point-shooting sounds like a great idea (to be able to naturally point at a target), it is (for 99% of people) a very bad idea.

@summary
the other option is called "flash sighting".

@summary
studies in police departments which train with flash sighting against departments who teach point-shooting have shown staggering results.

@summary
most people can use that one-tenth of a second to get that guaranteed hit instead of just putting a bunch of holes in the walls behind the bad guy.

@summary
ultimately the "point of the gun" (mentioned in choosing a good sidearm) is still important as it will decrease the amount of time required to flash sight, but since you are still using the sights it is less important.

alternatively, most real life threat armed encounters occur at less than 21 feet (6.4Â m), and the accepted hit rate in the shooting community is < 20%.

 Past three or four yards, it may be impossible to get reliable hits on center-mass of a target. And remember, they say: think of the worst day at the range, you will be twice as bad as that in the middle of a gun fight!

, This means you pull the gun up to the standard shooting position; focus hard on the front of your gun and when the front post (sight) is somewhere in between the rear sights, you fire! It doesn't matter where; at three to seven yards even the worst flash sighting gets center-mass hits.
 The flash sighting police hit their targets four times as much as those who point-shoot. Average first shot times were less than one-tenth of a second slower (for those who flash sight).
 Flash sighting is something that needs to be rigorously trained, else you might return to point-shooting.
, And since most PD's have and still train in the use of sighted fire, it obviously fails or is not available for use due to the BAR and it's affect on vision and fine motor skill coordination. Thus a knowledge of and practice in Point Shooting can provide the insurance and assurance that one will be able to make hits at close quarter ranges. And it is not a bar from using sighted shooting methods if conditions allow them to be employed.
