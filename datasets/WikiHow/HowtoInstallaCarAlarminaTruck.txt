 Follow these specifications to install an alarm siren:


Find a mounting area under the hood of your truck, at least 18 inches (46 cm) away from sources of extreme heat (exhaust manifolds, heater cores and radiators) and high in the engine compartment.






Face the siren speaker downward, so as to avoid water damage.






Depending on your truck's make and model, you may also choose to mount the alarm system siren in your truck's inner fender, if you feel that area is even harder for a potential thief to reach.
Determine what is behind the surface you plan on mounting the siren to, making sure there are no lines, cables or wires that your screws will go into.






Use metal screws or nuts and bolts to mount the siren to your chosen surface.

Use either metal screws or nuts and bolts, being careful to choose a surface that does not have important lines or wires behind it.
Arrange the built-in control module wire away from the module. Slip the wire inside a cut-down drinking straw for stability.



Drill a hole into the top part of your truck's dash, where you want your LED indicator to be.
Feed the LED indicator wires through the hole.
Use double-stick tape to secure the LED indicator to the dash.
 Decide where you want to place your sensors and attach them in the same fashion as for the LED indicator.
 Connect them in their appropriate positions. Use a crimping tool to secure the connections, and electrical tape to protect the connections.
