,, Your thighs should be parallel to the ground and it should appear that you are sitting in an invisible chair.








Your knees should never extend past your ankles--they should be straight above your ankles. You may need to slide further up or down on the wall to get into this position.This position strengthens your quadriceps on the front of your thigh and your hamstrings on the back of your thigh, which can help prevent damage to your knees. These muscles are necessary for everyday actions like standing and walking, so it's important to keep them in good shape.,,









Rest for 30 seconds, then repeat. Try to do 5 sits at 60 seconds each, or until your muscles become too fatigued to hold the sitting position.If a trainer or doctor has instructed you to do a different number of sits for a different length of time, follow their orders. This is simply a guideline to get you started.
 Instead of repeating the move and bending your knees to 90 degrees each time, first slide down the wall only a couple of inches. The next rep, slide a little bit further down, and so on.
