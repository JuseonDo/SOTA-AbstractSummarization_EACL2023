 Although adding some white wine may not make the stain disappear, white wine neutralizes the chemicals in red wine making the stain easier to remove.;
, Take care not to rub the stain, which can work the wine deeper into the fabric fibers.
 The carbonation in the club soda may help to lift the stain. The salt in the soda helps to prevent the wine from absorbing deeper into the material.


Saturate the stain with club soda and allow it to sit for a few minutes.
Blot the spot again using a dry cloth to see if the stain goes away.



Saturate the stain with the solution and allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes.
Use a clean cloth to blot the stain again.



Soak a sponge in the mixture, then lightly squeeze it until the sponge is wet but not dripping.
