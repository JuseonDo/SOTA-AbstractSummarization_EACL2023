 This step is seemingly the most simple, but you have to assure that there is nothing to hit your head on. Concussions are not exactly a fun things to have. Make sure that you have ample space to jump up and that there are no slippery rugs beneath you, as they could cause an unsafe slip and fall.;
, This may seem silly and superfluous, but it will cause the adequate swing factor that will be later learned.
 Do this lightly because you don't want to rely on your hands, but on your stomach and feet. For individuals with weaker stomachs, you can use your hands to avoid your head crashing into the earth while practicing. Practiced professionals need not use their hands and can use only their legs, but most readers are learning and not already trained.
 Here comes the tricky part. This move takes a great deal of practice to master and can be quite difficult if correct force and velocity are not achieved. At this step, there is an extremely important element, flexibility. From afar it appears that the legs and stomach are doing all the work, but the important aspect is the back. While in the motion of swinging your legs to the floor, you should feel your back start to bend as if you are doing a back bend usually seen in gymnastics.

, You should feel a smooth wavelike bend from your bottom to your neck. All of this should be achieved while your body is vertical to the ground with only your feet touching the ground. There should still be force that starts to swing your upper body forward.
 Without balance your bottom will end up slamming on the floor and bruises may develop. When you feel balanced, stand up.
