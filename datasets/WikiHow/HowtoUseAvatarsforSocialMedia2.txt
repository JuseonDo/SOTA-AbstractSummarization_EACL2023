 Choosing an accurate, up-to-date photo as your avatar keeps your profile authentic and genuine; especially if you frequently connect with other users in person. For example, don't use a photo of yourself that was taken 10 years earlier.
 If your social media profile is public, it can be seen by anyone in the world; including children, and people of other races, origins, gender, religion, and more. For example, don't use an avatar that displays racial slurs or offensive hand gestures.
 Avatars that appear friendly and personable can influence other users to interact with you. For example, use an avatar that depicts a photo of yourself smiling and appearing relaxed, instead of a photo that conveys your frustration or anger.
 Using the same avatar for all your profiles will make it easier for other users to recognize and connect with you, especially if you are trying to promote your business or services.
