 They currently have over 1,500 stores and the website says that they are adding more stores each week. Use the search bar to ensure your store is not listed in another area before you leave the site.
 If you want to know if there are restrictions on your favorite online stores, go through the alphabetical list at http://www.ebates.com/help/storeexceptions.htm. Some stores only allow purchases from certain departments or up to a specific value.
 Once you make a return, the store informs Ebates and they subtract money from your account. Exchanges are processed the same way, so you must return an item and then make a new purchase through the Ebates link to get the cash back on your product.
 You can receive an additional $5 for each friend you refer who makes a purchase. Click the “Tell a Friend” tab at the top of the page to start this process., Ebates will only send your money via PayPal or check if you reach this threshold.
