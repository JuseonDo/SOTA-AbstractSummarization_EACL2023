@summary
before you do absolutely anything, start jumping up and down in the room your in, screaming your head off cheering.

@summary
start off with his back faced to you.

@summary
muster courage, and charge him.

@summary
stab it.

@summary

@summary
climb on him.

@summary
stop and rest when you see little platforms on his armor, complete with 'walls'.

@summary
climb onto his head once you've recovered energy, where you can walk down further (unless he's still shaking).

@summary
start stabbing!

@summary
,

@summary
once he dies, you'll be alerted with a cut-scene of a dramatic death of the first colossus.

@summary
you will warp to the beginning point (the temple), where you are assigned your next colossus.

, If you shine the light of your sword, you'll see it focuses onto his head and onto his left leg.
 You will see his left leg has an exposed cut. You must grab onto his leg, and climb onto the wound.
 Common mistake is to rapidly press the attacking button, which would result in a minor stab. This is ineffective. You must press it once, wait for him (The Wanderer) to pull back, the energy bar to alert you it's being consumed for the stab, and press it again.
 (However, if you stab him again, he will be brought down further, allowing you more of a chance to gain more elevation before he recovers.)

, Your adrenaline is probably going, and you're probably be running out of energy. Stay calm, for there is a stop on the way to rest for energy.
 He will fling you around, i.e. shaking, but if you crutch down (grabbing button), you should stay pretty level, and recover energy.
 You must make your way onto his head, and grab hold.
, You have won.
 (He's not far off!)
