 You will need:


An anvil
A bow
Enchanted Book Flame I;
, Right click on it to open the anvil 'window', which will allow you to use the anvil.
 Then drag the newly enchanted bow from the third slot into your inventory. This will cost you two XP levels.
 If you shoot a chicken with a flaming arrow, it gives you cooked chicken. The same will work for sheep, cows, pigs etc.
 Try making a trap with it. Hook up a dispenser to a tripwire, so that when someone walks over the tripwire, the arrow ignites the TNT.


However, flaming arrows will not set fire to trees or wood.
