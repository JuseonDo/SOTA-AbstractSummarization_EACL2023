 Draw an egg shape, then add guidelines as shown.;
, Add small ears and a curvy C-shaped nose. Give him a smile a W-shaped chin.
 Make it fall shaggily around the sides of his face, like a messier version of his sister Meg's.
 Draw a large oval for his arm and a circle for his hand. Add in ovals for the fingers.
 Try to make them as smoothly connected as possible, ending in relatively small shapes.
 He usually wears a blue shirt, black pants, and white sneakers.
 Make sure no excess guidelines remain.
