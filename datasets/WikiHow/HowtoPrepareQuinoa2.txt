 If you bought packaged quinoa, this step isn't always necessary, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
 One option is to toast the quinoa before placing in the rice cooker. See Step #2 in Method One above for directions.
 Water, chicken stock or broth, or vegetable stock all work.
 Some rice cookers will have different settings instead of a simple "cook" option. Try the "white rice" option if your rice cooker gives you several options.
 Fluff with a fork and serve.
