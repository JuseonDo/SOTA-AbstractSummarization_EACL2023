@article
 If you are a rookie, find somebody that doesn't have any weapons or anything so you can easily run away if you fail.;
, (Wait until the little tab at the top of the screen changes from 'Detected' to 'Hidden'.)

, The inventory menu will come up with the victim's items on the right, and yours on the left. You can take anything from his/her side and put it in yours; in effect anything that the person owns is yours for the taking.
 This works if you put a grenade in their inventory, the grenade will go off, thus killing them.
