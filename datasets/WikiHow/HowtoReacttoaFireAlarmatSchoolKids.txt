@article
 If it is a siren, or it sounds like a smoke detector, you should easily be able to tell the difference between your school bell and alarm. If it is the bell you use, make sure you know what signal it is.;
, It is against the law to not have at least four drills in your school year in some locations, so you should abide by the law, or if your school does not have fire drills, request one immediately.
 Do not collect your belongings before evacuating; your life is much more important. Stop whatever you are doing and get out and stay out!

, You may follow them to your exit.
 Either set off the alarm or tell any member of staff immediately. Remember to get out and stay out!

, If it is crowded, you should squat, just in case you get trampled on. Remember to go fast! okay

, Although, you have a natural instinct to hide, DO NOT. Leave the building immediately

, Your teacher will tell you what to do.
,, Then follow everyone back inside.
 So in case you were lost in a real fire, you would know where your nearest exit is.
