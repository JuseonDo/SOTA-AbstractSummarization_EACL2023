 While these are frequently located inside post offices, you can also found them in other public places. Do a quick search online to find an kiosk outside of a post office.


Go to usps.com then click on the "Quick Tools" heading. Select "Find USPS Locations" and choose "Self-Service Kiosk" under the location type. Enter your geographic information and search.
 This will start your transaction.
 This will probably come up as one of the top options.
 You'll need to select what type of stamp you need and how many you'd like to purchase.


For example, you'll need to choose from express mail, priority mail, booklets of forever stamps, international postage, or you'll select your own value postage.
 Once you've made your stamp selection, you'll need to pay with a credit, debit, or EBT card.
 The machine will dispense your stamps and receipt from two separate slots. Be sure to take both before terminating your transaction.
 This is so your card is not still active in the machine and no one after you can use it.
