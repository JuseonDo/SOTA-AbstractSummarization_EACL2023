 That way, you can see how the race is done and how they call them;
,,, Yes, have that old phrase stuck in you head. Just pretend to call a race either watching an old race on the television or write down your own race calls. Now is the time to make mistakes, not when you are talking live to the spectators. Your job is to accurately describe what's going on in the race.
 Obviously during the race itself, you will have to say what's happening then

, Also, check your headset microphone, obviously, it has to be a headset so you can talk and handle the binoculars.
 It's not going to help your announcing if you start to panic. Just relax, breath slowly in and out a couple of times and say "I could make a mistake, but I'll move on and overall just do my best" the actual announcer will be will you the entire race giving you support.
, It's good for you to drink water so that 1) you have a good clear voice and 2) it'll also relax you and not feel as tense.
 Turn off your wireless headset Microphone and thank the actual announcer for letting you do the races. Good luck, as this may be a huge step in your broadcasting career.
