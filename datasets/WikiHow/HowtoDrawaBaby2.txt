This will be your stroller’s body.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.



This will be the stroller’s shade.



Draw a big letter ‘X’ just below the base of the obtuse angle. The tips of the ‘X’ should touch the angle.



at the bottom end of the ‘X’, add two circles for the wheels.
Remember the obtuse angle earlier? Draw another angle to overlap the obtuse angle. This time, draw an acute angle. This will be the frame for the shade.



To complete the shade, connect the tips of the shade frames.
on the opposite side of the stroller, add a slanted line for the handle.
You now have the complete skeleton of the stroller. It’s now time to add the baby.



This will be the baby’s head and body.



These little circles will be the ears.

Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the hair, the bib or you can some decorations to the stroller.
