 This way, you will have water handy in case the flame goes out of control. Make sure that there is nothing near by that can catch on fire, such as curtains, towels, or detergents.If you can't work over a sink, try to work over a bowl of water.
 You can do this simply by lighting a candle or starting a lighter.
 The yarn should be about the length of your finger.
 Take note of how the yarn burns, and what it smells like. If the yarn smells like burning hair, it is wool. If the yarn smells like chemicals or burning plastic, it is acrylic.Wool yarn will burn quicker than acrylic yarn.
 Take a look at how the yarn looks like. If the yarn is wool, the burnt end will have turned to ash. It may crumble and turn to dust if you touch it. If the yarn is acrylic, the end will have melted and turned hard. It may look black or dark brown.
