 Cut the fish into three pieces and put them in a pot with some lemon grass stalks. You don’t have to put water. Or just add a bit of water. When the fish is cooked enough to flake off easily, put it down. Take out flesh and set it aside. Take out the fish bones and pound them. When you pound the bones, put some water, so as to get some fish stock out of the bones. You can throw the bones away when there is no fish stock to get out of the bones.;
, Do not throw away the oil.
,, When the oil is smoking, fry pounded ginger, onions and garlic with some paprika till fragrant. Then add the fish stock/broth that made out of the fish bones.
 Stir well to prevent sticking of paste.
 You can also add banana stem (1’ length) if you like. Remove the outer layers of the stem and cut rings from tender insides. Pound and add lemon grass bulb.
 You can add the flaked fish now. Add fish sauce/shrimp sauce to taste.
 You then add pepper powder and fried onions into the pot. Keep the pot hot at low heat about 30 minutes.
