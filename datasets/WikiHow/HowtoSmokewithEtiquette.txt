,,, Leave some behind to smoke later. You don't have to smoke it at once.
 Never re-roll cigarettes from cigarette butts. Always throw out the ashtray in a place where it cannot be retrieved i.e. a sink, toilet, the garbage etc.
 Never hold it.
 You don't have to smoke your tobacco all at once. Your lungs should feel a clear feeling inside.
 Put the rolled tobacco cigarette to your mouth and opening your mouth slightly to drag it in, pull in enough smoke under the side of your tongue. It should go under your tongue and circle around your mouth. Just enough so that it fills your almost closed mouth. This is the most important part of this article.
 It should eventually go slightly numb.
 Your lungs will think they are receiving nicotine and will have a clear feeling to them. You may experience a head rush. Your lungs carry all the black tar in them because it contains leftover nicotine. Your lungs become dependent on this tar for that nicotine. When you breathe out like this, your lungs absorb as much nicotine from the tar as possible, leaving the leftover ash behind.


The next actual drag should make your lungs feel clean inside. They now can differentiate between nicotine, and the ash.
, You should enjoy smoking. But always remember, your health comes first no matter what. If you are sick you should never smoke. If you are on medication of any kind you should never smoke. If you are younger that 21 in my opinion you should never smoke. For non-smokers, you're not missing much I promise you. Always remember, the consequences of tobacco consumption are lethal, which is another word for you will die if you smoke. Not just you, but your family, your friends, will be heartbroken without you. All for a cigarette, to look cool, to break out, because you smoke when you drink ect. There is no healthy way to consume tobacco.
