 If desired, peel potatoes, although peeling is not necessary.;
,, The smaller the cut on the potato, the faster they will cook.
, Here are some suggestions for things to add to sautéed potatoes:



Onions work really well with sautéed potatoes. White or yellow onions work best, although red onions can be used. Onions add a little bit of sweetness to the potatoes.

Garlic also works well, alone or in tandem with other spices. If adding chopped or minced garlic, incorporate toward the very end of cooking or the garlic will burn before the potatoes are cooked.

Herbs such as parsley, thyme, or rosemary. Thyme and rosemary together make a classic combination, while fresh parsley lightens up the heavier taste of the potatoes.

Spices such as paprika, dry mustard, or cumin. Paprika will add a little bit of heat and color; mustard adds a bit of tanginess; and cumin adds a bit of exoticism to what can be a very pedestrian dish.
 For one pound of potatoes, no more than a third-teaspoon of salt should be fine, especially if you're seasoning them with herbs and spices.
 Try to develop color on all sides of the potatoes.
 Potatoes should be soft on the inside but still have "bite" and crispiness on the outside.
