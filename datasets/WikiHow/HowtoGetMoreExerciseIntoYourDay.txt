 This kills two birds with one stone. The house will look fab, and so will you.
 An oldie, but a goody. If you work on the 31st floor, get off 2 or 3 floors below and walk that. Great for stretching your legs if you're cooped in an office all day.
 Alternatively, if you catch public transport, get off a few stops earlier and walk.
 Do 200 squats and not only have you cleaned your teeth for at least the recommended two minutes, you've burned some calories too., You won't even realise you're exercising!

, Another Oldie. Meet new people, as well as getting exercise.
 Try something new that you might just enjoy.
 Go for a walk, changing your path everyday.
 They'll keep you going til they drop, or until you do.
 Good for abs.
 Two birds again... The pet's happy, and you get exercise.
 Have some old-school fun with a jump rope, for example, or kick a ball around.
,, eg. Blue-do 2 star jumps, yellow, skip 10 times, red-do 2 tuck jumps, white-1 star jump and 1 tuck jump. Make up your own.
 Games are fun, cleaning is not.
, Make a list of things that happen often in episode of your favorite show, and match them up with an exercise. When you're watching, pause and do an exercise every time something on your list happens. Check out examples below.
