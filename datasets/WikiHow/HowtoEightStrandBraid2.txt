 It would be easiest if you have the outermost left and right strands level with the top of your braid, and the other strands spread out between them., Take the last/furthest strand in the right group. Pass it under all previous seven stands, until it comes out on the far left side., Take the strand that you just set down. Weave it under, over, under, and over through the next four strands., Take the first, outermost strand in your left group. Pull it behind all other strands, until it comes out on the right. Pass it under, over, under, and over across the previous four strands., Gently tug on the strands every so often to tighten them.
