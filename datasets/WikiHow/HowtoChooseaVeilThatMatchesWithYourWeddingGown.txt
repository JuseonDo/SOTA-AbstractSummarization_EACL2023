 The beauty and need of a veil depends very much on the shape of the face of the person who would be wearing it. For instance, your shape could be either Oval or Round or Oblong or Heart or Diamond or Square and even Rectangle and Triangle. While the first four shapes are soft and curved, the last four have more angular cuts. Remember that not every face shape needs a veil to highlight it.;
, Still unsure? Ask your family members or friends to know about the shape of your face.
 A tall bride must wear a veil that is more commanding while for a petite bride, the best purchase would be a very fluffy veil with a large pouf. And brides with thick waistline should go for an asymmetrical veil that cascades varying lengths of tulle down the back.
 A hair stylist can give you an idea about what type of veil will work with the way your hair would be styled on your wedding day.
 Take a friend or family member along with you for a second opinion.
, For example, if you have a round, full face you can wear a veil that falls along the sides of the face to make your face look narrow.
 In case you have bought an elegantly detailed wedding gown, choose a simple veil. Any sort of ornamentation on your veil should start below where your dress embellishments end.
 If you want to wear it for the ceremony only you can choose a veil with long trails. But if you want to wear your veil until the party's over, go for a shorter veil.
, Examine the veil from all angles as one that might suit you from the back might not look that flattering from the front.
