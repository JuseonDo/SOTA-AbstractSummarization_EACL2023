 Take along a measurement that you have already chosen; do this by measuring the area where you'll hang the ribbons., These are the wire joining rings used for jewelry making and are ideal for adding the prize ribbons to the chain., Thread a jump ring through this hole for each award ribbon., Use pliers to close it tightly. Repeat along the chain for each award ribbon.

You can place the ribbons in each consecutive chain hole, or space them evenly across the chain, allowing space for the size of the award ribbon.
 Use hook hangers to hold the chain ends firmly in place.
