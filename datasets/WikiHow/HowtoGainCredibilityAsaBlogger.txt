 Your readers need to know when they can expect to read posts from you. After you've established a strong readership, you can get away with posting on a less-consistent basis. But when you are just starting out, being consistent is important to reach your audience as well as build your library of content.
 This makes you part of the discussion and builds the interactivity aspect of the blog. If you don't reply to what your visitors are stating, they may be less likely to come back and remain part of the discussion.

Building relationships with other bloggers in your niche can help your blog grow, the same as networking with people in the real world.
 This helps to establish who you are and where you are coming from for your readers.
