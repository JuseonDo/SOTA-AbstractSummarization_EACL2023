 The E is pronounced either as a mute e (the 'uh' sound sometimes used in buttER), as the e in "set" or as the ay in "may". The letters are pronounced differently depending on where in a word they lie - something important to realise is that if a word ends in a single e, that e will be mute (like in buttER). Note that the J is always pronounced as the Y in "Yankees";
, More casual is "Hoi","Hai" or "Hey". In the Achterhoek they say "MÃ´gge"

, Note that the "i" in "ik" is pronounced as the "i" in "bin".
 (Ya(w))

,, (Da(w)nk Yuh). "wel" can be added to the end of this expression to convey the English phrase "very much".
, (NOTE: Politer is "Mag ik" but you'll probably starve before you can pronounce the dutch "G".)

 Simply say "Waar kan je iets drinken?" (wAAr Cawn Yuh EEts drink-uhn)

, If you feel all icky-and-chilly-and-scared, just learn this one sentence; "Spreekt u Engels?" (Spraked ew Ang-uhls). If you can't even remember this, just ask "Do you speak English?". Because 90% of the population does. Just don't let the accent scare you away.
