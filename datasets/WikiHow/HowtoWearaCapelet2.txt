@summary

@summary
throw on a pair of comfortable jeans and a turtleneck made of relatively thin material.

@article
 Throw on a trendy heeled boot and a heavy wool capelet in a neutral color like dark brown, gray, or black.
 Avoid thick wool or heavy cotton turtlenecks that may add extra bulk around the shoulder area. Since the caplet is open under the arms, you can wear any style of sleeve though, so you donâ€™t have to restrict yourself to narrow sleeves. Wear a heeled boot or closed-toe heel and wrap things up with a neutral-colored twill capelet.
 Wear a pair of warm leggings or skinny jeans beneath the tunic and throw on a pair of fashionable boots.
