 Take 2 cups of all purpose wheat flour (such as Atta flour) and put them in a mixing bowl. Gradually add enough water (approx 200mls) & knead till a dough forms.
 Take a non-stick pan or a tawa (a tawa is a small pan that can be substituted with a crepe pan). Cook the chapati over medium heat until chapati has black spots on it, flipping the chapatis frequently to cook evenly.,
