 If it will be a straight line, you can tape a guide string to the front and rear of the car, pulling slightly on the string to make it straight. This will be your guideline.;
, Pull off the backing and slightly stretch the tape and extend it to approximately 1/2 the distance on your car. As you slightly tug on the pinstriping, you can make the line perfectly straight. Once you have the position you want, begin to lower the pinstriping to your car body and it will attach itself lightly as you lower it to the car body.


If using reflective tape, after attaching the first 1", spray the car down with a solution of 6 drops of dishwashing liquid to 1 cup of water. Spray this solution on the car to prevent tacking of the reflective tape, otherwise it will stick and break if you should need to pull it up and try again.
, Simply take a straight edge and cut the pinstripe or reflective tape in the middle, then wrap the excess around the door towards the inside of the vehicle.
 After several passes along the entire path with your finger, you can push progressively harder on the pinstriping or reflective tape.
