@article
 Wear low-heeled sandals with virtually any skirt length or pant length.
 Higher heeled sandals make your legs look especially long, thanks to both the heel height and the extra skin showing on the top of your foot.
 Limit them to the beach or, if necessary, for running errands.
 Shorts, capri pants, and some dress-down sundresses work with walking sandals, but avoid wearing them with dressier clothes.
 For instance, try matching a pair of kitten-heel sandals with a casual denim skirt and fitted blouse to make the outfit a little dressier.
