 Make sure you have these things in the game:


2 types of sausages
2 types of buns
1 type of drink
1 type of snack

, The next steps will outline the easiest way, however you can choose any other option you want from the tables below. These tables demonstrate how many points you will get on the 3 station with different combinations of meat, buns, toppings, drinks and snacks.


The Scoring System, and easiest way to get 0 points, are also on there.
;
, With this you will make sure that for every customer the waiting score is 0.
, If they want normal sausage, put Italian sausage on the griller. If they want Italian sausage, start grilling a normal one. It doesn't matter what type it is, it just has to be a different one to what the customer ordered.
 Eww!

, Again, the bun has to be a different one to what the customer ordered in order to get 0 points.


The hot dog will now go to the build station.
, If they didn't order anything, give them a fizzo (doesn't matter what size).
