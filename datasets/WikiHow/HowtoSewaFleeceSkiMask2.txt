 The fabric should stretch horizontally, perpendicular to the fold. Try to fold the fleece so that it is the exact width of your pattern.,, Either draw around the pattern with a fabric pen or pin the pattern directly onto the fleece and cut with fabric scissors. The only part of the left hand fold that you will cut is the space for the eyes., Sew on the inside of the fabric and then turn it inside out., Create a 3/4 inch folded hem in both areas.

When you pin the eyes, make a diagonal cut in the corners and fold each side down. Pin it in place.
 Set it to a small zigzag stitch. This will give the polar fleece more stretch than a straight stitch., Sew the eyes with a zigzag stitch. You may choose to use a thread that is a matching color, especially around the eyes., Try for a 1/2 inch seam allowance. Polar fleece does not fray, so the seams are important simply to create the form of the hat.,, Try it on to ensure it fits.
