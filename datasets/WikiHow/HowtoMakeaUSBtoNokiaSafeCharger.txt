 Clip the white and green cables to uneven lengths so they can’t conduct into each other or either of the power lines. Hopefully you should be left with a black wire and a red wire.;
, You won’t be needing the wall part anymore. Strip off the insulation from the Nokia plug wire. Hopefully you should have a red wire and a black one. the red wire should be connected to the inner barrel of the plug, and the black one should be connected to the outer barrel.
 It should go between the red wires from both cables. Attach the black wires from each cable together.
, The colors might not be standard.
