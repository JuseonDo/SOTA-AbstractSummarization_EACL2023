, The midsummer season allows bay leaves to produce their oils more abundantly, making harvesting easier.
 This will ensure your leaves do not wilt.


Detach the bay leaves gently from the trees. You do not want to bruise them.
 You should pick the largest leaves that are available, as these will have the strongest flavor and fragrance.
