 Use a sturdy fabric that can handle getting a little wet. Since this is likely to sit alongside a basin, it needs some waterproofing quality. You'll also need a zipper and some sewing supplies.;
, This will depend upon the amount, length and width of the items you'll be placing within the bag. The shape of a square or rectangle works well.
 It can go either at the short side or long side of a rectangle, depending upon your preference.
 Iron it flat. If the fabric is likely to melt under the heat of the iron, place the fabric underneath a thin towel first, then iron it on a cooler setting.
 Allow for a half-inch/1.2 centimeter (0.5 in) seam allowance on all sides.
 Fold over a half-inch/1.2 centimeter (0.5 in) piece of fabric on one side of the square or rectangle. Iron it flat. Place the edge of the zipper beneath the fold. Stitch the zipper in place with a tight, sturdy stitch.
 Use double stitching. Attach a set of small Velcro circles to the inner hem of each pocket.
 Miter the lower corners of the bag. Double stitch the seams.
 Turn the case right side out.
 This is optional but is useful for those times when you might wish to hang the bag up while staying away or camping.
