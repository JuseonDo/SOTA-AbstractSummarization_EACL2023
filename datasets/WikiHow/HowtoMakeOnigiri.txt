 Note it should be Japanese-style rice so it sticks together easily. However, you might want to leave the rice in the pot for about 20 to 30 minutes before turning the rice cooker or pot on, so that the rice can become sticky.

, As you're waiting, make your fillings (if applicable as this is optional). Whip tuna and mayo in a bowl, cut vegetables, meat, etc to kill some time.
 This is to keep the rice from sticking to your hands (although some grains will still stick) and to keep your hands cool from the hot rice. Scoop some rice with a spoon or scooper.
 This is where your filling is going to go, so just deep enough to place things in.
 Make sure that you don't overfill it! Fold some rice over the hole/crater so that all fillings are hidden. If you press too lightly, the rice won't stick together and will crumble as you eat it. If you press too hard, the rice will get mushy and soggy. To make a triangle, make an "L" shape with your hand and use that to shape your rice with.
 It's up to the person if they wish to use a strip or wrap the whole rice ball in seaweed. The seaweed keeps your hands rice-free and keeps the rice ball in its shape.
 Enjoy!
