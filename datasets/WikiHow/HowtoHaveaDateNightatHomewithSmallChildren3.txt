 Don't turn the sound up too high and avoid movies with sudden blasts of sound, such as action movies with lots of explosions.
 Slow music might fit the romantic mood and be unlikely to wake the children. If, for example, the only place to dance is in the kitchen, consider using a cell phone to play music, if your phone provides this feature, or a radio.
 They will hear the water running through the wall and your voices might be amplified by the tiled bathroom walls.
 Bring the baby monitor with you and interrupt your romantic time, if necessary, if your child needs attention. Do NOT under any circumstances lock your children in their rooms. Lock your bedroom door instead if you need privacy.
