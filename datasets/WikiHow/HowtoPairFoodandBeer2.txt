 Pairing food with a beer that shares some of its flavor or aroma is a great place to start. Seek out beers and foods with similar elements of aroma and flavor profiles., Foods such as aged Gouda, walnut cake, roasted pork, smoked sausage and cashew chicken will complement the malty flavor of a brown ale., The coffee and chocolate flavors of a stout highlight silky, salty foods such as oysters on the half shell. A stout also pairs well with braised or caramelized meats and sauces., Coriander found in dishes like fajitas or tacos complements the herbaceous flavor of hops in an IPA. Likewise, many IPAs have tropical notes that can be accentuated with fruits like mangos.
