 Ready-made orthotics are pre-made with a certain arch type and support system., Remember you do not want gel-like orthotics. Many people make the mistake of purchasing gel insoles thinking that that will help their foot pain; this is typically not true. It could actually make your feet worse and hurt more later.,

Remember, if they recommend a gel or air cushion one, don't take their advice.
Brands such as Doctor Scholl's are gel or cushion based and are not recommended.


Some sports stores may have better ready-made orthotics but may cost more.
 Some stores may allow you to try them out for a certain number of days. If they are hurting your feet after a few days you should try a different kind. A day or two of discomfort as the feet adjust to a new pair of insoles is often normal, but much more indicates a mismatch. The wrong insoles can hurt your feet more than no orthotics at all!
