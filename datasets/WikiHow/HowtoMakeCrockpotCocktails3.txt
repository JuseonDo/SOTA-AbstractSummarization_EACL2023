 This is how much time they will need to cook., If you like in the United Kingdom or in Europe, note that this recipe uses non-alcoholic apple cider. If you can't find any, you can use unsweetened, unfiltered apple juice instead., You are ready for the next step when the juice is very hot., If you don't plan on serving the martinis right away, place the lid on the crockpot, and leave it on "warm" until you are ready to serve. Just before you are ready to serve the martinis, open the crockpot, and add the vanilla-flavored vodka. This will prevent the alcohol from cooking off., Pour equal amounts of sugar and cinnamon into a shallow bowl. Stir the two briskly together with a fork until they are evenly combined., Work one glass at a time. The lemon juice is what causes the cinnamon-sugar to stick to the glass. Working one glass at a time will prevent the lemon juice from drying out before you dip it into the cinnamon sugar.

Don't use cold glasses for this.
 This way, you serve the guests the martini as they ask for it; the crockpot will keep the martini warm in the meantime., Garnishing is not absolutely necessary, but it can take your martinis to the next level. You can use cinnamon sticks or thin apple slices for this.
