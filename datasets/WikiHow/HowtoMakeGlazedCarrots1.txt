 Rinse the carrots under cool water, then chop the ends off. Peel the carrots using a vegetable peeler, then cut them into thick slices; try to make the cuts diagonal rather than straight down.;
, Fill a deep skillet with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water. Place the skillet on the stove, and bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat., Shake the carrots until they are free of water, then set them aside. They will be slightly underdone, which is fine; you will continue cooking them in the glaze.
 Put the butter, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice into the skillet. Turn the heat up to medium, and wait for the butter to melt, stirring occasionally with a spoon or whisk.
 This ensures that they cook evenly, and that they get coated with the glaze.
 Once the carrots are tender, they are ready to serve. If you will be serving this to young children, however, allow the carrots to cool for a few minutes.
