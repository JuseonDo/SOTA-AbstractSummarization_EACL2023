A dealer-only auction requires a car dealer license in all 50 states and is the main way dealerships rotate excess inventory. Unlike public auctions dealer-only auctions tend to offer close to new cars, new cars, recent trade-ins or just off-lease vehicles. In addition, many vehicles are detailed, have existing warranties and are carefully rated as to condition.






Public car auctions are open to anybody, including savvy dealers, so the prices may not be as low as the hype suggests. You see these advertised all over the place including online and in the backs of newspapers.;
, Be as flexible as you can as you will be buying at auction.
 The most frequently used sources for this are, DriverSide, Edmunds, Kelly Blue Book and Nadaguides. NADAguides is owned by the Automobile Dealers Associations so their pricing is always most favorable to the dealer - not the consumer.
 Do not forget that your final price will include taxes, registration and other fees. Also consider ongoing costs - sites like DriverSide will help you estimate cost of ownership.
, A proxy buyer is an individual (sometimes a group) who has a legal dealer license and runs a service where he or she attends wholesale auctions to buy an individual car for you.
Acquire a dealer license. This is typically a time-consuming and expensive process that is not practical unless you plan to buy and sell cars as a business. States rely on taxing dealerships for income, so there is little or no incentive for a state to grant a license to an individual who does not plan to operate as a car dealer.
 Once you have found one that has the vehicle you want, make arrangements to attend the auction or have your proxy buyer attend the auction.
 Each auto auction will have its own terms; verify these in advance make sure that you have the correct payment options available if you win the car.
