,,,, You need to set a First day (even if it's today's date, for an immediate start), but the Last day is optional.


If you want to keep the responder on indefinitely, don't check the box next to Last day and leave that field blank; then you can just come back and turn off the auto-responder at any time.
 You'll probably want this include some basic information for anyone emailing you, including:


how long you'll be offline/away from email
when you can be expected to respond to them
to whom they should write if they have an urgent situation

, If you want to send it only to your contacts, check the box saying so.
 Then try to stay away from checking your email while you're on vacation!
