 If you're using a round piece of dough, then you can lay it out any way you like. If you have a square piece, then lay it out like a diamond.;
, Crack a raw egg into a small bowl and whisk it with a fork until it blends completely. This will help create a mixture that holds the roll together. Once you cook the roll, it will be safe to eat. If you're using rice paper or another wrap that you don't plan on cooking, then you can not use the egg mixture to secure the wrap because it will be raw.
 This will help these parts of the wrap stick together when the time comes.
 Place this on the sheet near the bottom and spread it out in a line. This line should be about 1/2 to 2/3 inches tall. Make sure that the line doesn't overflow off the sheet. You want to leave enough room on each side of the wrap that you can comfortably fold the wrap without the contents spilling out.
 Just fold each side over until they just touch each other, or come close to touching each other, over the filling.









Some people like to fold the top and bottom of the wrap first, and then tuck the sides over the top and bottom before they roll them.
 Be careful to tuck it under the front side of the mixture, the side away from you.
 When the line of mixture isn't visible because it is under the sheet, fold the sides near the end of the line. Hold those down while you continue to fold. Make sure that you are folding with your hands in the middle of the line of mixture.
 Your spring roll is now ready to cook!








, This should do the trick.
 You can make as many as you like, or just make one for yourself.
 Just 2-3 minutes on each side should do the trick. Put a bit of oil on a frying pan and fry the rolls over medium heat. Give them a minute to cool off and they're ready to go.
