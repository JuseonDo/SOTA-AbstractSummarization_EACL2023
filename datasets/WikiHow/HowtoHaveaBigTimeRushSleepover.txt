 This is especially important if you are quite young.;
, If they are wearing a BTR shirt, then it's quite obvious. Write down names of the girls who want to go. Do NOT invite anyone mean.
 Find Big time rush invitations, draw your own or just print out pictures. Mail out the invitations.
 They could include CDs, T-shirts, make-up or concert tickets if you are rich. If you don't have enough money to buy everyone concert tickets but you do have enough money to get 2 concert tickets have a contest.
, Skip any tracks that are scratched. Or buy a CD just for the party and get dancing! Let people take turns playing BTR games on the computer. Open up a snack table. If BTR comes on TV watch it.
 Majority wins. If someone doesn't like that food then just order a pizza instead. Do this step at dinnertime.
 If you don't know exactly what to talk about, discuss your favorite episodes, favorite songs, or how much you want to meet them. (if you have not met them)

, Make sure your parents cut the cake evenly. If they don't, everyone will fight over the biggest piece. If it is a birthday party open your presents after. If not go to the next step.
 If you can play them until bedtime. Then have story time or movie time.
 If not do story time and share experiences from meeting them if you had met them. Then go to sleep. If you want to stay up, read how to stay awake all night.
 Make sure there is as many balloons as there is people. (besides you)

,, Say this. "Everyone will get to choose a balloon but don't pop it. I will tell you when you can pop it and the lucky balloon will have something inside" Don't tell them what it is though. Don't tell them to pop it until everyone has a balloon. Whoever wins will be so happy. Hand out the goodie bags.
 Put on the music until everyone is gone.
