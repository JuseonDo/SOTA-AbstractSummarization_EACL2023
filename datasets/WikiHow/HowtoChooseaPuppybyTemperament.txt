@article
 In general, puppies are classified as responsive, nervous, aggressive or independent.


A responsive puppy is adaptable and binds well with humans, which makes it a good choice for a first-time dog owner.
A nervous or shy puppy is unpredictable, and not a good choice for families with children or other busy households.
An aggressive puppy is dominant, sometimes unpredictable and does best in a household without children or other pets.
An independent puppy is stubborn and best suited to an outdoor life.;
,, Evaluate how he reacts to your handling, and whether he enjoys it.
 Put your hand over his throat. See how he reacts, and whether he's scared or resists.
 Whistle, and rattle a chain or your keys., Give him a few minutes to adjust, then try walking a couple of steps and see if he will walk with you

, See how he reacts to other people and animals.
 If he wants to eat, allow him to do so, then take the bowl away again after a few bites.



A nervous dog is stiff to the touch, his eyes are wide open with fear, he's scared and runs away, and won't eat. When performing the leash test, he won't move.
An aggressive dog will resist your handling and petting, will growl and bite your hand or the leash, and bark and lunge at everything.
An independent puppy isn't interested in you at all and wants to explore things on his own.
 Remember, a responsive puppy is always interested in what you do and doesn't challenge you, unless it's to play. Nervous and aggressive dogs require an experienced dog owner and a lot of attention to keep them in line, while an independent dog is best suited to be a working dog such as a guard dog, sheep dog, or hunting dog.
