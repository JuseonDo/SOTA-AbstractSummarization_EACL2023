 France runs on the Euro and will only accept payment for tickets in Euros.


A notable difference between the Euro and the dollar is that the Euro has higher coin denominations. Don't toss those coins aside; they could pay for your ticket to Versailles.
 There are a number of reputable companies that run half-day tours to Versailles, which include tour bus transportation to and from Paris.


The major benefit of these tours is that they are pre-booked, so that you do not have to wait in line. They cost between 16 and 25 Euros ($23 to $36 or 14 to 22 pounds,) depending upon the season.
