 Chalks come in a range of pastel and bright colors, depending on where you buy them from. Check art, craft or upmarket toy stores for a wider variety than you might find in traditional stationery or dollar stores.
, The amount of salt depends on the amount you need.
 Roll the chalk back and forth over the salt on the paper. As you do this, the color from the chalk will color the salt. Keep rolling until you're happy with the color.
, The colored salt is now ready to use, or you can store it until needed.


Repeat the process for as many colors as desired.
