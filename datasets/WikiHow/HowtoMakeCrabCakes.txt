 Use 1 lb. (450 g) crab meat; 1/4 cup (60 ml) minced green onions, green and white parts; 1/2 cup (120 ml) minced bell pepper; 1/4 cup (60 ml) mayonnaise; 1 large egg; 1 tbsp. (15 ml) Dijon mustard; 1 tsp. (5 ml) salt and a dash of cayenne pepper in a large bowl.









You can use a spoon, spatula or your hands to combine the crab cake mixture.;
,









Start by adding 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of cracker crumbs or dry bread crumbs and add more as necessary.
You will probably use about 1/3 cup (80 ml) cracker crumbs or dry bread crumbs.










Cover the bowl with plastic wrap before putting it in the refrigerator.
Allowing the crab cake mixture to rest at a cool temperature makes it easier to shape into cakes.










Pat balls of the mixture into round patties.
The size of the crab cakes depends on your preferences. If you are making the crab cakes as appetizers, you might prefer to make cakes just 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) across. If your crab cakes are to be served as a main course, you will probably want to make them larger. Just make sure that they will be easy to turn over with a spatula.










The flour can be seasoned with spices, if desired.
,, Be sure not to crowd them.
 The first side should be golden before you flip the crab cakes.
