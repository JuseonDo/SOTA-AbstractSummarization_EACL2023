 You'll feel better about the task at hand and it tests how well you tapped the keg before you put your face near it.;
, On subsequent attempts all 3 may not be needed, but if you're all just learning, this will work best.
, You won't be able to talk or use your arms so a signal such as "3 short grunts" or "bending both knees" is preferable.
 They will be the 'lifters'. The lifters' job is to 1)help you into the proper keg stand position 2)help you stay there 3)help you get down fairly gracefully when you're done.
 All taps are different, so it depends on your tap, but you get the idea.
 Have the lifters stand to the left and right of the drinker, facing each other. The valve operator should stand wherever is easiest, most likely opposite the drinker.
 Do not grab the handles of the trash can (see Warnings). Each lifter should grab one of your legs, somewhere around the knee. The valve-person should insert the valve/spout of the tap into the your mouth, but don't start yet. (This may seem like a lousy job, but it's really important).
 Don't worry, this is easier than it sounds because you have help. The lifters should help you get into said 'hand-stand' position by lifting the legs in an arc and guiding you up. Once there, hold steady. Once you are up, the valve operator will release the valve and hence the beer into your mouth.
 one-Mississippi). The higher the count the better! This final count can be used to ascertain which of your friends was up the longest. If you have the highest count you can use this to brag at the party or later.
 When the stop signal is given the lifter should stop counting. The lifters should then help you back into the standing position and the valve-operator should stop the flow of beer.
 You did it! Switch-up and lift for your friend!
