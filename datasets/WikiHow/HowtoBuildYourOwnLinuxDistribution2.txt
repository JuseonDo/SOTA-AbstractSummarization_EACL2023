 SUSE Studio is graphical and browser-based, and is a relatively easy way to create your own custom Linux distro.Note that you will need to verify your new account via the email message you receive from Suse Studios.
 Consider your needs when choosing your Desktop template. Minimal X is a truly "bare bones" set up. If you are looking for a fast, highly functional system with few bells and whistles, then consider Just Enough OS. GNOME is another popular choice that adds a good bit of extra functionality (control panel similar to Windows), but is still relatively spare. KDE4 is highly configurable with a broad range of features, and is designed to allow users to create custom systems.
,, Keep in mind you are going to want at least a browser, graphics software such as GIMP and some type of multimedia utilities such as Flash Player or gstreamer and a text processing app (Libre Office is very popular).
, Choose your background and logo using the images provided or upload your own.
,,, Note that it may take as long as 15-20 minutes to build your new system (depending on connection speed).
 Click the Test Drive link toward the bottom of the page, and the system will begin to boot. Press Enter when you see the OS logo on the monitor.
