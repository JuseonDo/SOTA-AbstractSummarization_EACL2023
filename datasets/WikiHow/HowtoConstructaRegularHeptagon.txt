 Keep in mind that you will need some extra space around the circle for construction lines.
, This circle intersects the first circle at points B{\displaystyle B} and C{\displaystyle C}.
 BC{\displaystyle BC} bisects AX{\displaystyle AX} in E{\displaystyle E}.
 This circle intersects circle a in D{\displaystyle D}.
 BD{\displaystyle BD} is one side of the regular heptagon. 
, You should end up exactly where you started. There is an error of about .2% for this method, which is negligible for any heptagon that fits on a regular A4 piece of paper. If you don't end up exactly where you started, there were probably some inaccuracies with the construction tools (e.g. the thickness of the pencil).
