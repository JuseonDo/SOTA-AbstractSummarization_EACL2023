 The charity was founded by Prof. Dr. Willem van Cotthem from Belgium. In 2005 he was invited to become the advisor for the so called “Family and school gardens in the Sahrawi refugee camps of South-East Algeria”.
He found that, while space and even water wasn't the problem, seeds were. The people simply couldn't afford to buy them. So the professor decided to step in and collect seeds, and "Seeds for Food" was born. And now you can help. How? By collecting the seeds from fruits and vegetables you eat at home.;
, Seeds that can be used are:


vegetables such as lettuce, beets, carrots, onions and parsley.
tropical fruits such as melons, pumpkins, peppers, avocados, papayas and eggplants.
, Never use paper, since paper sticks to the seeds.
