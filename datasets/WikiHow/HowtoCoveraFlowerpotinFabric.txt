 This provides a good background for the pot, especially if the fabric is a little see-through. It's a lot more neutral to have white bounce back than terracotta orange!;
,,, Measure the fabric against the chosen flowerpot. The fabric needs to be large enough to cover the outside of the pot, as well as having enough to cover the base of the flowerpot and about 1.5 inches/2cm to wrap over the rim.
, Decide which direction you'll work in; the important thing is to go in sections and keep working around the flowerpot in the same direction.


Work efficiently. Mod Podge will dry quickly, so the fabric needs to be attached quickly. This is why it is best to work in sections.
Add Mod Podge to the fabric as well, this will help ensure even coverage.
 Smooth out to prevent wrinkles.
 Add the next part of the fabric. Continue in this way until the flowerpot sides are covered.
 Again, use Mod Podge to keep these fabric sections in place.


Trim off any excess before the next step.
 This provides a protective layer over the fabric.
 Place on something like a plastic envelope folder or a sheet of wax paper, so that it doesn't stick to anything.
, A fabric-covered flowerpot is best used as a vase display decoration, as it won't get dirty from adding soil.
 Take care when watering the plant and place a small glass dish or lid under the flowerpot to catch the water (or don't cover the saucer).
 For example, keep pencils, utensils or notes inside the flowerpot.
