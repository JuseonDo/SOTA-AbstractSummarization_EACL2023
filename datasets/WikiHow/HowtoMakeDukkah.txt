, Put the seeds on one tray and the nuts on the other.
 Remove them from the oven when they have darkened slightly. This will take about 10 minutes. Allow to cool.
 Grind the nuts and seeds together, along with the salt, turmeric and paprika. Do not over-process - the mixture must have some texture and not be too oily or powdered.
 Cut small slices of baguette or similar bread and place different types of olive oil in small bowls. The idea is to use the bread to dip in the olive oil of choice, then dip in the dukkah for additional flavour. This has become a popular choice at wine tasting events where olive oil is also on offer for tasting.
Use to season. Dukkah makes an excellent seasoning for meats or fish fillets - apply to oiled meat prior to roasting, baking or frying or mix with flour for coating fish fillets.
