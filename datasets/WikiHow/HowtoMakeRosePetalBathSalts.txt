The salt mixture pulls the natural essential oils from the rose petals. This is infused into the salts. Depending on how fragrant you want your salts, repeat the above process by adding petals to your existing mixture.
If you add more rose petals, put your salts in a mortar and gently grind them into the existing salt mixture.
Let your mixture sit for approximately 1 week before adding any additional rose petals.
 You can also do this with lavender, jasmine, honeysuckle and many other flowers.
