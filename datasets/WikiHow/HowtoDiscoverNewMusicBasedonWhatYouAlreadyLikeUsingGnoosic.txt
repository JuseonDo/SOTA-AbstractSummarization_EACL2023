, Below it you will see three buttons: 'I like it', 'I don't like it', and 'I don't know it'. Choose the appropriate answer and try to be as honest as possible.


It is important to be honest because your answers (and the answers of other people using it) is how Gnoosic learns and expands its database.
 After about 10 times, a comment form appears. You may skip it if you want to.
 Once you answer or skip the comment form, a summary page appears. It lists the three bands or artists that you provided in the beginning, the related artists you like, those that you don' like, and those that you don't know about.
 These are potential musicians that you may like.
 As an example, let's say you want to know more about Gordon Lightfoot.


Take note that Gnoosic only recommends based on what you like and what other users like, there is no guarantee that all of its recommendations will suit your tastes.

, The Music-Map will present you with other bands or artists which it 'thinks' you will like based on what you put in.
 Your initial band or artist will be on the center, with other names of bands or artists surrounding it. The closer each band/artist is to one another on the map, the greater the probability the people will like both of them.
 You can then decide whether to purchase your new-found music to add to your collection.
