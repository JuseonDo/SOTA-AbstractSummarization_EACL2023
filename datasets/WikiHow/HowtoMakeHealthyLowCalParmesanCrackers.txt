@article
 Grate your own or buy it pre-grated in a package (see Tips below).


The cheaper Parmesan cheese tends to produce a crisper cracker and will store better.;
, Don't overlook the parchment paper––it's an essential requirement. Preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC.
 You may fit up to 5 of these across the baking sheet, and four rows, for 20 crackers per sheet.


If possible, it's a good idea to make a huge quantity of these, so that you can freeze a lot and eat a lot!

, As you place the cheese on the baking sheet make sure all cheese is placed together.


Note that after baking, stray pieces they can be saved and eaten or sprinkled on or in something or given to the dog as a snack

, Put the baking sheet(s) on the upper shelves and bake for 5 to 12 minutes or until brown around the edge. If you like it really crisp, bake until the entire cracker is brown.
 Let cool if you like, for a few minutes. However, you can remove the crackers immediately if you are in a hurry. Remove with a metal spatula––put on a plate until the next batch is out of the oven.
, They are low-cal alternatives to cookies, a great snack, and a healthy addiction. That's all there is to this!
