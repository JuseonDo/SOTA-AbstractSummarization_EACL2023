 It's easiest to draw it right side up the first time, as shown here, and give it rounded corners so as to look more like an actual cell phone.;
, Now your phone should look almost like a long rectangular box with rounded corners, or a deck of unusually thin cards

, You can make it as large as you want, just leave some space for the phone's buttons.
 You can draw another in the middle if that's how you imagine your phone to look, and make the rectangles as big or small as you want.
 You can even add some directional arrows: up, down, left, and right. Add a circular button in the middle.
 Paint the screen a bright color (like neon blue). You're done!
