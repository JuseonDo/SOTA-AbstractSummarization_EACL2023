, The general rule is 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish per gallon of tank water. Size your tank based on the ADULT size of the fish, not their CURRENT size. Platies get up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long as adults. These fish also like to be kept in a group of 3 or more so your minimum tank size is 9 gallons.
 You should do a fishless cycle.
