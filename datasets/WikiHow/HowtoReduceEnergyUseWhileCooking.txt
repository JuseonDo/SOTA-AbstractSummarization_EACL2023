 This may benefit from planning ahead what you need to get out prior to opening them.;
, Putting frozen items in the refrigerator also reduces the amount of energy it needs to use to maintain its low temperature.
 There’s no need to use the energy required to heat up the largest element when you’re only using the smallest pot in the kitchen. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting that maintains boiling. Higher heat just escapes round the side of the pot or boils the liquid faster, and doesn't increase the temperature of the liquid above boiling or cook its contents faster.
,, The cleaner the surface, the more efficiently it can transfer heat, for both heating and cooling.

, Just a few minutes may be all that's necessary for pre-heating. Turn off the oven or stovetop a few minutes early. The residual heat will keep cooking the food.
 You'll skip lots of energy wasted when stuff heats up and cools down. If you're ambitious, cook once a month.
 It uses less energy than standard cooking., It takes extra energy to cool it. Let it sit out and cool to room temperature, then put it in the fridge.
 It'll boil faster that way.
 The temperature, and thus the rate of heat conduction into the inside of food to soften it, is limited to the boiling point when there is liquid water present. (A pressure cooker increases the boiling point by adding pressure. Impurities such as sugar or salt increase the boiling point, but not significantly unless they are present in great quantities as with brine or syrup). More heat only increases the heat right at the pan surface, increasing the possibility of scorching soups and other viscous liquids.
