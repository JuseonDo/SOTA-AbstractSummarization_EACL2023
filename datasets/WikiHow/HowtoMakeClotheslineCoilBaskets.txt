@summary
begin coiling the clothesline into the shape you'd like the finished piece to be.

@summary
machine sew a zigzag stitch across the space between one wrap and the next.

 It may be circular or oblong, and it may be flat or have sides that come up. Really the only requirement is that you be able to get your sewing machine inside to stitch it together.
 A ruler and a rotary cutter will help with this process., When you reach the end of one strip, simply start the next. There is no need to finish the edges. You can wrap as you go and use a pin to hold the end in place while you stitch the coils together. Make sure each wrap overlaps the previous one.
 For a round piece, simply coil the rope into a spiral. For an elongated or oblong piece, start by folding the clothesline back onto itself in a straight line, then build the coil working out from that.,,
