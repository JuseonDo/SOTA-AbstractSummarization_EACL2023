 Follow the instructions provided with the cake printer and edible icing packet or edible paper for aligning the image and printing it. This will differ depending on the brand of sheets and printer you're using.


Important! For this step, you must use a printer that is only for food printing or has been extremely well cleaned, so as to avoid toxic ink components. See "Warnings" below.
, Set aside.
 Do this by gently pressing the side of each jello shot with your finger and gently drawing to the middle to release its hold on the edges. Use another finger to help leverage out the shots.


If they are really sticky, a gentle run of warm water on the back of the pan may help. Take care to have the shots ready to fall onto the plate (not too far).
 If you find that there isn't enough space, the paper cases can overlap slightly but don't overcrowd the shots themselves (see above).
, The shots will look amazing with this added on top. Guests can help themselves to a shot simply by grasping the sides of the flattened paper case and lifting to their mouths. They can use this paper to hold the jello shot while they nibble it.
