 Here are some possibilities:


Reading - This is a good fit for stationary bicycles or stair machines where you don't have a lot of motion.
Listening to music or audio books - Many people enjoy listening to music while exercising and find that music can help motivate them in their workouts. An engaging audio book can be a great way to pass the time as well.
Watching Television - Many gyms have TVs near their stationary exercise equipment that you can watch while working out.
Talking with a workout partner - If you are doing less intense activities, you may be able to talk to a friend while you exercise.
Video Games - Most current generation games are 60+ hours long. Imagine how many calories you'd burn riding a stationary bike whenever the XBox is on.
Deep thinking - The repetitive nature of most cardiovascular exercises can free your mind to think about other things while you exercise.;

If you are running, walking or cycling along city streets, be sure that you can hear approaching vehicles.
Don't talk to friends so loudly that you disturb others nearby.
