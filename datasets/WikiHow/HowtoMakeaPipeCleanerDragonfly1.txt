@summary
take two pipe cleaners, each a different but complementary color.

@summary
wind a third pipe cleaner around the stems near the top to form the head.
@article



Bend one pipe cleaner into the shape of a long U.
Twist the other one around the two stems, as shown in the image. This forms the body's middle and holds the folded pipe cleaner in place.;
, The color of this pipe cleaner should match the one wound around to form the body.


Be sure to leave enough pipe cleaner at each end to form the two "antennas" coming out of the head. Simply bend each end over in a U shape to form the antennas.
