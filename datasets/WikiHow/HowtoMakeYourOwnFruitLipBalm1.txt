 If you don't like petroleum jelly, try shea butter instead.Petroleum jelly is easier to come by, but shea butter will be a lot more nourishing for your lips.;
, Make sure that the beeswax is either in flake or pellet form; it will melt easier. If your beeswax came in a block, shave it using a cheese grater.
 This will melt the ingredients together and make it easier to stir in the drink mix.
 Make sure that there are no lumps or clumps. If you can't get the lumps or clumps out, your mixture may need more heating. Put it back into the microwave for another 30 seconds, then stir it again. Keep doing this until everything is smooth.


Be careful when taking the bowl out of the microwave, however; it will be hot.
 For example, if you want to make strawberry and cherry flavored lip balm, separate your mixture into two smaller bowls. If you plan on making just one flavor, leave everything in one bowl.
 How much you add in depends on how dark flavorful you want your lip balm to be. Start with a pinch of powder, stir, and add more until you get the color you want.
 Work as quickly as you can. The lip balm will start to set fast.
 It will finish setting there, and become hard like regular lip balm.
