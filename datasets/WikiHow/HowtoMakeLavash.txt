, Mix until well combined.
 Mix well between additions.
 You should be left with a very stiff dough. If it is too stiff, add a few drops of water, if it is too sticky, sprinkle on a little bit of flour.
 In about 10 minutes, you should have a stiff, firm ball of dough.
 Add the dough ball. Move it around so the entire surface of the dough is coated in oil.
 Allow the dough to rise, until doubled in size, this takes about 2 hours, depending on the room temperature.
 Separate into balls, whatever size you'd like the finished flatbreads to be, and roll them out into very thin circles

, Leave at least an inch between them so they can bake evenly.
