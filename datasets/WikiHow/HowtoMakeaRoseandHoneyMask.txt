,, Sift the ingredients through the flour sifter several times to refine the consistency.
 This mask needs to be brought to life with the addition of moist contents. You can add your favourite face cream or use such ingredients as honey or milk for dry skin and witch hazel, Aloe Vera or water for oily skin. Yoghurt works well for normal skin, as does pureed fruit of choice. Always add one tablespoon of rose and honey mask and one tablespoon of liquid addition.
 Smooth over your face as with any face mask. Leave on for 10â€”15 minutes; it should be patch tested before use in case you have a reaction.
