 As stated earlier, you need iTunes to move your photos from your computer to your iPad.
 You can easily find it on the top right, under “Devices.”

, Once you do, make sure to tick the box that says “Sync photos from.” Remember that “Sync” means “from device to PC, while “Sync from” means “from PC to device.”

, After which, select your photo folder. That will effectively get the folder onto iTunes.
 You can choose the photos you want to transfer to your iPad one by one, or you can just move them all in one fell swoop.
 You’ll find it at the bottom right of the page. This last step will ensure that your photos will be successfully moved.
