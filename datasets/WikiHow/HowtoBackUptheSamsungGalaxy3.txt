 You can use Google Photos to backup all of your photos for free. Photos backed up for free will have a slightly reduced quality than the original images. If you choose to upload the original sizes, photos will count against your Google Drive storage.,,,,,,,,,,,, You can choose between High Quality, which allows you to upload unlimited pictures for free, or you can choose Original Quality, which will use your Google Drive storage., This can take a long time if you're uploading a lot of images. When you return to the Google Photos main screen, you'll see circular arrows on all of the photos that are waiting to upload., You can find your photos in the Photos app, at the Google Photos website, and in your Google Drive storage.
