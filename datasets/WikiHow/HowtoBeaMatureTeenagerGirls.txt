, Try making it simple if you want with style, color, and more. It's all up to you.


Change your clothes if you have to; in middle and high school, don't wear childish clothes like Bobby Jack, Disney, or Barbie.



Buy skinny jeans if you want.






Don't always wear loose pants. Show off your beautiful shape!






Don't only wear the same type of clothes all the time. From time to time change up and wear a provocative, off-the-shoulder tee, or tunic.



If you are trying to fit in with the wealthier crowd of cool kids, buy jeans from Hollister or Abercrombie.
 Don't go all out and like you're going to the Grammy Awards. Just wear eye shadow, eye liner and mascara. Less is more.
 Curl it one day and scrunch it, straighten it, or put it in a ponytail the next.
, Try to have at least two pairs for winter. Have sandals for summer. In some schools, they have to have a back, but they can be open-toed.
 It can be fake Coach if that's all you can afford.
 You can be made fun of if you wear long striped socks.
 Don't wear those fabric bras with no support, either. If your breasts haven't developed yet, wear ones that have padding; someone will always be looking and you don't want a guy that you like to tell his friends that you're flat-chested.
 Don't fool around and do stupid stuff. It can annoy some people if you always play with food at lunch or mix your food together. Be nice but don't let people walk all over you.
 Whether its working as a Bagger/Cashier at a Grocery store, Waitress/Hostess at a restaurant or a seasonal job, having a job gives you the understanding of hard work as well as reaping the benefits of it.
 Having your bank account helps you understand managing your financial assets and, teaches you how to better plan for any situation.
