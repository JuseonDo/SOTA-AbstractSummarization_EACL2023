 There should be nothing on it as you begin cleaning.;
, Use gentle soap, a soft cloth, and warm water. This includes any grill plates, knobs, and burners. Do this every time you use cooktop.
 Use a soft sponge, paper towel, or clean cloth to gently scrub the cooktop. If you prefer, you can use liquid dishwashing detergent instead of a chemical cleaner.


You may need to reapply the cleaner or detergent if there is still debris or caked-on splatter.
