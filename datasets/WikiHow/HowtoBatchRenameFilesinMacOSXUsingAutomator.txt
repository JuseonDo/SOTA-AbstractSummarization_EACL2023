The rest of the steps in this tutorial are based on clicking "Don't Add" in this step.
 Select "Add Text" or "Replace Text" from the drop-down menu, accordingly.
 Just type it into the text box.


If you are adding text, select "after name" or "before name" or "as extension". Selecting "after name" will add the text at the end of the file name and in front of the file type extension.
 Type in the text you are searching for, and then type in the text you want to replace it with.


If you are replacing text, select "full name" or "basename only" or extension only". And if you want uppercase and lowercase letters to be matched uncheck "Ignore Case".
 If you are making just one change to your file names, that's the last step. The names of your files should now be changed.
 If you are making more than one change to the file names, such as adding text to the beginning of the file names and adding text to the end of the file names, click these 2 Xs to close these 2 windows inside Automator. Then re-drag your files into Automator.
