@article
 For the sake of an example, black and blue will be the two colors for this tutorial.;
, Lay one upon another (as shown in the picture).


Add a key ring to any wire. Push it to the center so that you can use it as a key chain.
 Place it between the next two strands.
 Then place the last one in the loop of the first strand. At this stage, you have made a starting square stitch. Now continue doing this until the project is approximately 6 centimetres in length.
 Then take the first wire and place it in between the center part by passing it through the previous wire (as shown in the picture). Pull tight. After that, cut the remaining wires, leaving approximately 1 cm of length in place. At this stage, you have made one side of the letter. Now make the same piece for the opposite side.

Before starting the opposite side, take the keyring with which the previous side was made and place the keyring in the middle of the new side's one strand. Then follow the same steps as for the previous side.
 First create a starting stitch, then place it below a strand (as shown in the picture). Then take the strands up and make a tight knot before continuing with the stitching.,, Cut off the excess wires. It is now completed and you can add the A to a zipper pull, key chain, lanyard, etc.
