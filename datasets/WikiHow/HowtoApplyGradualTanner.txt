 Most big skincare brands now make a gradual tanner, so you have a lot of choice. The main products are Dove Summer Body, Johnson's Holiday Skin, L'Oreal Nutrisummer, No7 Naturally Sunkissed Gradual Body Tan, Garnier Summerbody and Palmer's Natural Bronze. Most products come in two versions, one for pale skin and one for dark skin, so choose the right one for your skin tone. Some Gradual Tanners also come with a hint of shimmer, so are ideal for taking on holiday.;
, On the day of application, shower, then apply a light coat of a thin moisturiser or body lotion to your skin and allow it to be absorbed. Make sure your skin is completely dry before taking a small blob at a time of the tanner and applying it to your skin. Remember to rub it in thoroughly and apply it everywhere.
