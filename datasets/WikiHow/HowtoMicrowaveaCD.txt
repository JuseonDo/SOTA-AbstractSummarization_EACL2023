 Do not use metal materials as a holder.;
, Close the door completely shut and start cooking.
 These fumes are unhealthy when inhaled. A well-aired room beforehand, such as an open window near the oven, will help eliminate the smoke effectively.
 The heated aluminum of the CD creates a very small electrical storm complete with lightning and sparks. You can observe all this activity through the oven door, though normal precautions have to be taken.
 Even after just five seconds the disc can be conducting electrical currents. Touching a freshly-destroyed CD with bare hands could burn you. Do not inhale the air outside the oven just after a session. Let the microwave cool and air the room out by opening windows.
 Notice the different patterns and paths etched over the material creating tiny metallic "islands".
