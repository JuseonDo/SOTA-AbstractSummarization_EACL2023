 You will be straining the ice out when you pour the final drink. If you'd like ice in your final drink, fill the glass with ice now.;
, For a stronger drink, add ½ ounce (10 milliliters) of Vodka.
 Keep your hand over the lid so that it does not accidentally pop off.
 Take the lid off, and replace it with a strainer. Pour the mixture through the strainer, and into the glass.
 The Dirty Girl Scout is usually left un-garnished. If you'd like to make it look more interesting, however, you can add a few mint leaves on top.
