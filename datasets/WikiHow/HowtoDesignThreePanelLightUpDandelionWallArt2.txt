 Make sure you have enough room for painting and have protected the surfaces around the painting area.


Allow the paint to completely dry before adding your design. Also, depending on how deep of a color or type of paint you chose, you may want to paint two coats.


Draw a large round circle two-thirds from the top of the canvass and color it what you desire white or yellow works well.






Add a stem to your dandelion using green paint or whatever choice of color you like. The stem should run from the middle, base of your circle to the bottom of the canvas.






Use red and orange to accent and add texture to your dandelion. Or you can just create more of an abstract look using just the yellow.
,

Design fuzz and seeds by dipping a small paint brush in yellow paint and then using the tips to make small splotches.






Create a trail or line of fuzz and seeds flying off the dandelion and splattering throughout the other two canvasses.
