 If you prepare your skin, it will look 10x times better than a face mask alone.;
,, You can buy cleansers at your local supermarket, but keep in mind that you do get what you pay for! You can buy creams, liquids, wipes (beware, these aren't very good, and won't thoroughly cleanse your face). Wipe off your cleanser with cotton wool.
 Make sure this is a face exfoliator, not a body exfoliator - it's not gentle enough and will make your skin flaky and sore. Wash off exfoliator.
, Fill the bowel with boiling water, then place your face on top on the water, catching the steam, but not touching the water with any of your face. Place the towel over your head, and the bowel, to catch more steam. This cleans your pores. Steam your face for 5 minutes.
 Grab a banana, a tablespoon of mayonnaise, Bran or Weetabix, an egg, and some milk.
 Bananas are amazing for dry skin, holding special chemicals in them.
 You should be left with a thin creamy texture.
,, It needs longer than most, because there aren't any harsh chemicals that will react with your skin if left on for too long.
