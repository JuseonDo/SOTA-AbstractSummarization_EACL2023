 “uHibbuka” is pronounced “oo-heh-boo-kah,” with the “oo” portion rhyming with “too” and “you.”, “Ana” is pronounced “ah-nuh,” and rhymes with the girl’s names “Hannah” and “Anna.” Using this method to say “I love you” is normally reserved for situations in which you want your lover and everyone else to know your true feelings.
