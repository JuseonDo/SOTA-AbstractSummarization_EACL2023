If you are not a subscriber to both Comcast services, you will not be able to watch shows or movies online. You should contact Comcast for more information on the availability of digital cable and high speed Internet.;

The Comcast home page may open automatically as a subscriber. If it does, you will see Xfinity.com in large red letters at the top left of the screen. If you do not see the Xfinity.com logo, you will need to go to the Comcast home page by following the next step. If you do see the Xfinity.com logo, skip the next two steps.
 The webpage address you are on will highlight in blue.



This will take you to the Comcast Home Page.

The Xfinity.tv page appears.

You can filter your choices by using the menus on the left side of the screen. Television shows can be filtered by genre, collection, network or the day of the week they normally air, while movies can be filtered by release date as well. Both television shows and movies can be searched by using the alphabetical menu or entering the name of the title in the search box which unfortunately is not available any more.



If you chose television shows, a new window opens allowing you to scroll through the episodes available to choose the one you want to watch. Choose the correct episode by clicking on the title.
If you choose a television show or movie that requires a subscription, you will be prompted to sign into your Comcast online account in order to confirm that you subscribe to the service. If it is not one that requires a subscription (such as HBO) you will not be prompted to log in.
