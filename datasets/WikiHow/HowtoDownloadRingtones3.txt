 Using the app to find a ringtone is fairly straightforward, but there are a few extra steps you will need to take to sync them to the appropriate location.
 When you see “Zedge” appear in the search results, select it.
 The app will now install to your iPhone.
, You’ll see options such as “Categories,” “Featured” and “Popular” that host a variety of different tones.


If you want to search for a specific tone or song instead of browsing categories, tap the magnifying glass icon, then enter your search.
, Use the cable that came with your phone or an appropriate replacement. If iTunes does not launch automatically once the phone is plugged in, you should open iTunes manually.
 You should find your iPhone at the top left corner of the screen.
 You will see the saved ringtone on the right side of the screen. If you downloaded more than one ringtone, they will all appear here.
, If you have more than one tone, place checkmarks into those you want to sync.
, The sync process will begin. Once you hear the chime, the sync is complete.
, The ringtone you downloaded from Zedge is now your default ringtone.
