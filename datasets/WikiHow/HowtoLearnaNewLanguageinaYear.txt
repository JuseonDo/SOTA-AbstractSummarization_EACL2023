 In this way, it will not be hard for you to learn that particular language.;
, Either to learn the language on your own or from a tutor or classes. You should use the internet and language learning websites like Duolingo, Memrise, and Italki. All you need to do is make an account. It is really helpful as you can talk to people around the world who are also learning that language.
 It can be really handy and helpful as you can make notes and revise them at the end of the day or anytime.
 In this way, you both could practice by talking to each other in that language., For example: In Spanish, Buenos Dias is used for saying "Good Morning". You can take "Dias" as we say Day and from Day you can take out morning so "Buenos dias" means Good Morning.
, It will stop you from forgetting your lessons.
 Practice makes perfect.
