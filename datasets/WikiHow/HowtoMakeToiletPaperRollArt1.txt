 You will be cutting the roll to create oval circles that will be joined together to create a flower shape. Generally you can cut approximately six circles from one roll so determine the project size when gathering rolls.;
, You will need to temporarily hold your rings together while the glue dries so procuring approximately four to six clips is a good idea.
 You donâ€™t want jagged or ripped edges, so go for the super sharp pair (or sewing scissors).
 The Tacky Glue will be used to glue the rolls together. Once the sculpture has dried you will spray the entire piece with spray paint so select a color that will compliment your decor.
