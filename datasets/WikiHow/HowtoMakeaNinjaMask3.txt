 Your t-shirt should be one that you are alright with not wearing again. This will be the material that you make your mask out of., Lay your head as flat as possible against a piece of large paper and have your friend trace the shape of your head with a pen or pencil. You do not need to trace the details of your head, just the general round shape of your head and your neck.If you do not have someone to help you trace your head with, measure the length of your head from the top of your head to your collar bones. Also measure the back of your head to the tip of your nose. Using a pen or a pencil, draw a profile of your head facing the right. It should look like a large, thick ‘P’.
 Using a pencil or fabric pen, trace the silhouette onto the t-shirt. You should place the silhouette against a sewn side of the t-shirt (like under the armpit of one of the shirt arms)., Make sure that you are cutting both the front and the back of the t-shirt.
 Make sure you do not sew the straight bottom part of the mask as that is where your neck will come out of.
 Cut a triangle of the fabric out so that both of your eyes and a small portion of the top of your nose will be visible when you put the mask on. The triangle cut should be made at the front of the ‘P’ shape.,
