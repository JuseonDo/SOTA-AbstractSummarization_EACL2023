 With so many people packed together, the temperature may rise rapidly. Other schools may crank up the air conditioner too much and keep you chilled. Bring a jacket along, if you don't need it, then use it as a cushion for hard seats/when on the floor.;
, You'll be less packed in and can exit faster. You will also have more room to spread out if you're on the floor.
 That's usually where the smart people sit and can be really annoying. Teachers usually keep a closer eye on this section too.
 They'll help you keep from being bored and then you won't have to be surrounded by strangers.
 Don't get too loud and try not to attract the teachers' attention.
 Very likely you'll get caught though.
 Tic-Tac-Toe and hangman are good too. Be ready to hide the paper if a teacher happens to walk by.
,,, Very risky since the book and papers will not likely go unnoticed. Don't try this unless you're sure you can get away with it or don't care if you're caught.
 The easiest thing to get away with. Works very well if you have an active imagination.
 Make sure the sound is turned off. Don't get caught or it'll probably get taken away.
