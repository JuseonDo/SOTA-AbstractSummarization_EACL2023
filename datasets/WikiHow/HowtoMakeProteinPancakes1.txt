 Traditionally used in smoothies to enhance post-workout protein intake, vanilla whey powder adds flavor to each of these protein pancake recipes.;
, Use traditional oats rather than instant oatmeal.
 Crack the egg shell whilst keeping the egg inside and tilt the shell slightly to pour all the white out. After separating the egg completely pour the egg whites into the blender with the oats.
 This should be added to the blender along with the oats and egg whites.
 If you want to create a sweeter pancake mix pour one teaspoon (5ml) of honey into the blender too.
 This is the last ingredient to go into the blender. In the blender you should have oats, egg whites, flour and/or honey.
 Process until a smooth like texture, just like traditional batter. Some bumps in the batter can produce thicker, better pancakes.
 Coat it with non-stick spray, butter or oil.
 Flip the pancakes half way through to cook on both sides.
 You can add toppings such as fresh fruit, powdered sugar, honey or icecream. The pancakes are best served hot.
