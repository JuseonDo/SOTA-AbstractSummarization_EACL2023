@summary
check your chosen vine that you want to cut and see if it is healthy.

@summary
cut off a piece of vine that's at least 6 inches long, has at least 5 healthy leaves, and has nodes.

@summary
remove two of the closest leaves to the bottom node.

@summary
place your cut vine in a jar or container of clean water, only filling the water up to where it covers the bottom one or two nodes.

@summary
put in a place where there is indirect sunlight, and wait.

@summary
use potting material that is mostly peat and drains well.whether your plant is growing outside or indoors in a pot, make sure there is at least six inches of soil-depth in which to grow.

@summary
with your finger, make a hole that will cover the cutting up to half an inch above its roots.

@summary
water the plant by sprinkling onto the dirt.

@summary
let the plant grow!,

@summary
water moderately when the soil begins getting dry, not really dry.

@summary
,

@summary
get a nice ceramic jar, flower vase, or container that is not taller than the cutting.

@summary
using pebbles or marbles, fill the container about 75% of the way up.

@summary
make a "hole" through the substrate and place the cutting in it.

@summary
fill the container with water.

@summary
let it grow!

 Do not choose a vine with:


Yellowing or decaying of the vine portion
More than a few brown, dried leaves
Black leaves
Decaying/dead growth-tip of the vine;
, Nodes are brown stubs opposite each leaf stem on the vine. Cut close to a node, because this is where the roots will sprout., This will prevent the leaves from rotting when placed in water.
 If you want to, you can add a tiny bit of liquid plant fertilizer. Overdoing fertilizer can be bad for your cutting, so if you don't know exactly how much to put, don't risk it.
 Make sure to check and refill the water level so the node(s) will keep growing roots. Once roots (at least half an inch long) show, you can transplant the cutting quickly if you want your new plant to begin growing in soil.If growing it in water, you can wait to transplant put watch out for stagnating/souring water (pour water out and refill).



If using a pot, there needs to be a drainage hole and a water tray underneath.
Using fertilizer is unnecessary, as pothos grows fast and it is optional.
 Place the cutting in the hole and place dirt gently over it to fill the hole. Do not pack down the soil.
 Watering on top of the leaves won't ensure all the water gets down to the dirt. The potting soil should be moderately moist and an inch of topsoil; not ever overly wet. Puddles and mud are not good for the plant.
 With good conditions, with a warm winter climate or re-starting each spring, pothos outside can create a "carpet" of leaves. You can use a trellis to encourage the vines to climb; just twine some long vines through/around the structure. Indoors, it can create a curtain of foliage if several vines are placed on a high shelf.,, Even a mason jar will work. The container should allow light to reach all of the leaves. .
 Using gravel sold for aquariums is another great substrate. If using material collected from outdoors, soak, brush and rinse it thoroughly first to get rid of any dirt.
 Gently cover the hole with the rest of the substrate. Choose a fairly long vine to be visually attractive. The roots should be completely covered, and an area up to an inch above the roots can also be covered with substrate (remove leaves that would decay in the water).
 Only add enough so that the roots are covered. Some water visible above the substrate level is fine, but avoid putting a lot of the cutting underwater.
 The vines can make a nice, small centerpiece in a casual room. Check on the water level once a week and refill accordingly.
