 If you have a backpack you are no longer using, this can work. Ultimately, you want a bag that is large enough to carry the necessary items but not be filled.;
, While it may be tempting to take things you already have, make sure you can do without it or you have enough to spare. For example, if you have a large box of disposable gloves, you can probably do without a few pairs. But if you only have one knife, you should purchase one just for your kit.
 The bulkiest items should line the bottom of your bag, for easy lifting.
 This will ensure your clothes stay dry in the event of a flood.
