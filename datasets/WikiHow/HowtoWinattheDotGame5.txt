@summary
in a 3x3 game with exactly 1 non-chain, 1 chain, and 1 loop, then player 1 wins (despite the count being odd).
@article
 I think the reason is because this is such a small situation, so the usual sacrificing tactics simply give away too much. For example, look at a 3x3 board with a chain of 3 boxes at the top, a loop of 4 boxes in the bottom right, and a non-chain of 2 boxes on the bottom left.
