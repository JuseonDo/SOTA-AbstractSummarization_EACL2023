 Using the keypad keys, 1, 3, and 7, you switch between the X axis, the Y axis, and the Z axis.;
, I suggest you put it at to figure's chest, while the armature's original point is at the figure's stomach.
 This will copy the selected point and move it with the mouse until you click.
 Go down to the bottom bar and add an armature modifier and in the Ob. field, type Armature.
 Select your armature structure and switch the bone display option from Octahedron to Envelope. Now select the figure's head armature and press the S key. Pull the mouse away until the yellow ball envelopes the whole head. Continue doing this until the whole rigging is enveloped. The purple bones are able to be enlarged, too.
 Just select an armature point and move it around with the Move tool and the head, arm, or eye stalk should move, too.
