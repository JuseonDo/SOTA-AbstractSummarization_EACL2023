stand barefoot or in socks with your feet flat on the ground.

@summary
ask a friend to measure from the back of your heels to the top of your head.

@summary
record the number with the rest of your measurements.

@article
 Keep your feet slightly apart and your back against a wall.
 Have them keep the tape measure straight and perpendicular to the floor.


If taking the measurement alone, hold a book or other stiff, flat object flat on the top of your head. Use a pencil to mark the bottom edge of the book, where it meets the wall. Step away from the wall, and measure from the floor to the mark.
