idle resource utilization: this is one of the most important power management technologies because idle time is a significant portion of the time a computer is turned on.

@summary
trigger start services: services were usually started automatically right after startup and would run in the background waiting for an event to occur.

 Idle efficiency in Windows 7 is improved by reducing resource utilization and enabling hardware to go into lower power states during long periods of battery inactivity. This includes the processor, disk, memory, and network activity on the computer. To demonstrate just how much power can be saved, CPUs consume nearly 0 watts when idle, but up to 35 watts at full power.;
, In Windows 7, certain services are only started when triggered by an event such as device insertion or an IP change. This makes it unnecessary to have services starting all the time and reduces the amount of background processes, then reducing your Dell D5318 battery.
 PPM allows Windows 7 to choose the appropriate processor performance state depending on the load and scale performance accordingly.
 Often times however, there are shorter periods of inactivity in between. To save additional power, ADB defines will allow dimming the display. ADB can also utilize hardware sensor technology to adjust display brightness accordingly to ambient light.
 This is the lowest unresponsive power state that a codec can go into. It can also further conserve power when an audio device is not in use. Windows 7 also supports selective suspend technology that extends to USB audio-class devices such as microphones and web-cams.
 Timer Coalescing increases the average idle period by letting the Windows kernel combine periodic software activity.
