 Curved nails are more likely to dig into the surrounding skin.Trim your toenails so they are even with the ends of your toes. If you trim them below the ends of your toes, your toes may press on the skin and cause the nail to grow into it.
If a pedicurist or podiatrist trims your nails, ask them to trim them so they are straight.
 Don't wear shoes that are too tight or pinch. Shoes that pinch your toes may squeeze the nail into your skin.If you have a job that puts you at risk of toe injuries, wear steel-toed shoes. A toe injury can increase your risk of getting an ingrown toenail.
Wear sandals in hot weather. If your feet are sweaty, the skin around your toes will be softer, making it easier for the toenail to dig into it.
 This is particularly important if you are vulnerable to recurring ingrown toenails. By inspecting your toes, you can catch an ingrown toenail as it starts.You can also quickly treat a fungal infection that might cause your toenail to get thicker or wider.
If you have diabetes, your ingrown toenail may have trouble healing. Talk to your doctor to make sure you get it treated properly.
