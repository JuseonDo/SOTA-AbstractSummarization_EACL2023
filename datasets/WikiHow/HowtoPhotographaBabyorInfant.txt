,,, Make sure it is enough to read comfortably. Natural light is best, whether inside or outside. But artificial lighting can be excellent, too, and allow for a more controlled "studio" effect. High-wattage reading lamps are terrific. Avoid fluorescent lighting; it is not flattering.
 Many young children hate the surprise from a camera flash.
 Babies are more likely to act cute if they feel comfortable. The fabric can also be a terrific background, especially if it has solid, bright colors.
, If your baby can hold up her head, she can be placed atop some folded blankets, draped with a soft cloth, facing you. Some children like sitting in their car seat, which you can drape with a cloth to cover it up. Crawlers aren't likely to stay any one place long, so work quick!

, But try to avoid holding the camera directly over your face. Your baby will most likely to react to you and your face, not a boring metal rectangle. If you don't have a tripod mounting, just hold the camera where the baby is in frame, and click when the baby's photogenic.
 You can also sing, talk baby talk, make silly faces, and so on. Be careful to not overwhelm the child by being too animated, however. If you go overboard, your baby will just start crying.
 Babies have minuscule attention spans. You won't get any good photos, and one cranky baby (and/or photographer) if you push it when the baby's tired of this activity.
