, American Girl doll accessories are often priced more than other doll accessories which means that the cost of the accessories can add up quite quickly. In addition, doll furniture tends to be more expensive than clothes or smaller accessories., Some people are really into dressing up their doll, while others are more into putting it to sleep or taking care of it., If a doll accessory is Christmas-themed, will it get played with during the rest of the year?, In the case of clothes, does it require a lot of snaps or is it something that would fall off the doll easily (like a hat)., For example, if your doll is Kit, then you would go to the historical doll section and then to Kit. If you don't live near an American Girl Place, go to the website and click on the section for the doll you have., American Girl has doll accessories for many common hobbies for girls., This is very important in terms of doll clothes. The colors of American Girl clothes resemble that of retail clothing stores -- darker in the winter and brighter in the summer. If the person who owns the doll finds dark colors dreary, then winter clothing might not be the best thing to get.
