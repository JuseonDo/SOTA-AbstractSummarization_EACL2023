@summary
when writing on paper, it can often become messy because the more you write, the more tired you get and the writing becomes scruffy.

@summary
create two copies by writing one out and photocopying it as many times as you want.

@summary
follow your plan and annotations.
@article
 To avoid this, follow these simple rules:


Write at least 3 full detailed paragraphs
Or, write a plan sheet fully
Rest your hands for 5 minutes. Dip them in warm water and roll your wrists around
Keep ploughing through until eventually, the work is done.
 If you can't get to a photocopier, write out one and again, create a note sheet for annotations or use sticky labels for annotations.
 Ask your friends or parents or even teachers to have a look at it and ask them how you can improve. Don't be scared. Remember, it's for your benefits.
