  Do this on the paper backing of a piece of contact paper.  Make it simple, just do the outline, but make him big enough to be the subject, or most important element in your Halloween picture.;
,  Try vertical and horizontal formats until you are satisfied.  Peel off the backing and toss it away.
,  If you require inspiration, go the the net or use coloring books to find ample references.
  Any watercolors will work, but because you will be mixing large puddles of color to cover big areas of the background, tube paints make your job easier.  Green, brown, yellow ochre and violet are needed for the background.
,  Return and paint as much detail as you wish.  Naked trees, withered corn shucks, pumpkins, bats, crows, a brooding sky a fence and ghosts.
  Punch up any areas and colors that need it.  Dry it again.,  Your scarecrow is ready to be painted.  Draw in the details on your scarecrow in pencil.  Have fun, make this figure your own.,  Use all the colors.  Dry the piece, stand back and analyze it again.  Tweak where needed.  Sign your work.,  Keep it to use next year.
