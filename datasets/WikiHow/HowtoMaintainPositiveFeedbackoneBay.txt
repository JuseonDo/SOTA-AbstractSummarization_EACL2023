 Describe your item in as much detail as possible with photographs. They may cost you extra but it's worth it!;
, Make the prices as fair as possible, whether it's concerning the "Buy Now" or "Auction" selections.
 This shows people you care about them and it makes them more likely to buy the item.
 This means it will arrive before the buyer expects, generating more positive feedback.
 This may sound boring, but it is very important that if a message from a buyer upsets or angers you, wait before you reply, you will regret it hugely later.
 Avoid waiting for them to post feedback about you.
