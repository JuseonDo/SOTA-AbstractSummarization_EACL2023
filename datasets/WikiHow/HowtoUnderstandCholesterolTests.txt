LDL stands for low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and is sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol." LDLs are fats that can build up on your artery walls and lead to heart disease.
HDL stands for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and is sometimes referred to as "good cholesterol." It removes bad cholesterol and prevents it from accumulating in your arteries.
Triglycerides are the chemical form of fat that comes from from extra calories, sugar and alcohol, and is transported in the blood. A high level of triglycerides increases the risk for coronary artery disease.;
, Lipid panel -- LDL, HDL and triglycerides -- have an optimum range.


For LDL you want your number to be as low as possible, with less than 100 being ideal. When your level reaches 130, doctors determine that your LDL is borderline-high. Your LDL level is high when it surpasses 160.
A high number is good for your HDL. A level above 60 is ideal. A level of less than 50 in women and less than 40 in men could indicate a risk for heart disease.
Ideal triglyceride levels should be less than 150, while 200 is considered high.
Your total cholesterol number factors in your HDL, LDL and other parts of your cholesterol profile. Ideally the number should be under 200, while doctors consider a level of 240 or greater high.



Your doctor may recommend more frequent cholesterol testing based on certain risk factors such as your age, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or family history of heart disease. Pre-existing conditions are also a factor, particularly if you are overweight or have already had a heart attack.
 The doctor may prescribe medications or put you on a special diet and encourage you to exercise.
 Your cholesterol may also be high during pregnancy.
