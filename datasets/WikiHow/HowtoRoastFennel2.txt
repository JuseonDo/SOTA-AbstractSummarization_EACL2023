 It will serve approximately 4 people. The ingredients you will need are:

2 fennel bulbs
2 tablespoons of olive oil (or more)
2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar (or more)

, Cut the stalks off (the green shoots on the top) and cut the bulbs in half lengthwise. From there, cut the halves into 1-inch thick wedges.
 Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar over the wedges and toss them again until they are coated with the vinegar., Place the fennel wedges into the pan. Arrange them so that they all have room and there’s only one layer of wedges., You want the fennel wedges to roast until they are cooked through. The edges should look slightly caramelized. When you see that, carefully remove the pan from the oven.


You can drizzle more olive oil over the top, if you like.
Serve immediately. This makes a great side dish to chicken or fish.
