 Sonic or ultrasonic cleaning systems work in conjunction with soluble crystals. They create a cleansing solution that agitates the aligners to dislodge microorganisms and kill bacteria that ordinary brushing cannot remove., Make sure you use the amount suggested in the product instructions.
 You may have to measure it, or the crystals may come pre-measured in packets or tablets that dissolve.
 At this point, don't forget to brush and floss your own teeth. Your aligners are only as clean as your teeth.
 The cleansing solutions are intended for your inserts, not your mouth. Rinsing afterwards helps reduce the chance of an allergic reaction from one of the ingredients.Rinse your hands and the sonic appliance as well.
 Once they've dried, put your aligners back into your mouth.
