okay, now that you've made your account you're going to want to get started training.

@summary
get your gear.

@summary
once you have this you can train - up to level 15 range, chickens!,

@summary
once you have 30 ranged it's off to barbarians/minotaurs.

@summary
buy yourself green dragonhide armor at 40 range, however you gotta keep the same body.

@summary
well the final place to train and by far the most boring is where we're going now!
@article
 Make it something suitable and unique, perhaps to do with the fact you're a range pure. An example would be "Rng Take0ver".;
, You're going to want to get the experience lamps from Sir Vant and Security of Safety (see pictures) - use all XP of lamps on range.
 You want to get this:oak short bow - willow short bow - maple short bow - leather boots - leather gloves - amulet of power - no ring - leather body - leather chaps - leather coif/ (for 20 range) - and then iron arrows (as many as possible)

, (show in picture) and then from 15-30 you want to train at cows (also shown in picture) collect feathers and cowhide

, train on these till 40. look at image from where they are.
 Then go to Hill Giants for good cash and exp - Collect big bones! Don't forget your brass key!. To get there go out the south gate of the grand exchange and run directly west. - Image shows where to.
 Lesser Demons in Karamja - 60-99 range here.
