 on the book. Yeah, it sounds boring, but it helps you fully understand the book in the long run. So you might want to try looking up things like the time period the book takes place in, and the cultures in it! It helps make it seem more exciting.;
, Do you have to write a report, make a display, or take a test?

, If you start the book with your class, be sure to listen to your classmates questions, and highlight important parts.
 If the book immediately seems boring, don't put it down. Instead think of why its boring you. Is the vocabulary throwing you off? Or maybe everything is just different.
 It helps.
 If you are really worried about your grade you can invite a friend in the class and study together. But make sure that your friend is helpful, and had read the book, and fully understands it.
 Review the sequence of events, and main theme in your head. The more you freak out, the less you remember

, First, go through the book fast, and reread it again and again fast, so that ultimately you know everything that is in it.
