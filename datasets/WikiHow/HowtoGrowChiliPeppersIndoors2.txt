 The seeds should be in a flat, single layer so that the moisture is evenly distributed.
 A plastic container with a tight lid or a large sealable plastic bag works best.
 Both warmth and moisture are necessary for germination.
 If they have swelled up, they are ready to plant. Some seeds may even have tiny sprouts shooting through.
