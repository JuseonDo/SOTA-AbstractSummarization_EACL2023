 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need". The items can be sourced from craft stores or craft sections in department stores. In addition, you'll need to decide on the colors of the foam paper you'll use for the wings, tail feathers and feet. You can be really creative and use crazy colors or stay traditional and use typical browns, oranges and reds.;
, Check the drawing for guidance to making each of the following pieces:

Make the tail feathers. You'll need five foam sheets. Trace around your index finger on each different colored sheet and cut out the resulting shapes.






Make the wings. Cut out two large triangles for the wings.






Make the feet. Cut two small triangles for the feet.
 Cut a small triangle out of foam paper. Bend the beak down the middle to give it a realistic shape.
 Place a small drop of glue onto each foot (the small triangles) and attach these to the bottom of the pot. The glue will be hot, even when using a low temperature glue gun, so use caution.
 Place each feather evenly across the back of the clay pot, in a fanning-out pattern.
, Allow the ball to dry, then glue it to the top of the clay pot, making sure not to cover the hole of the pot.


Glue wiggly eyes onto the head.






Attach the beak onto the head under the eyes.
 Take the untied end of the pipe cleaner and push it through the clay pot so that the knot stays under the pot.
 Cut a strip of paper or use an index card and write the person’s name on it. Bend the pipe cleaner to hold paper.
