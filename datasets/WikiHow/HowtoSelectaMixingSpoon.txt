 A wooden spoon cannot conduct heat up to your hand, hence it isn't going to burn you (unless the spoon is burning itself).;
, Metallic spoons can discolour pale food mixtures when they scrape against the metal of the saucepan or pan.
 Metal spoons will hold food better than a wooden spoon and capture more food when picking it out of bowls, pans, etc.
 The slightness of the spoon is an important consideration for successful folding.
, There is often at least another cookie or a half a muffin left on the side of a bowl! Spatulas are also excellent for smoothing the tops of baked goods prior to baking.
 These are usually bundled together and make it easy for your to know the precise amounts of ingredients as called for in a recipe.
