Some causes of change are certainly age related. Getting accustomed to your changed hair may be all you need to do.;
, If you have always gotten products for straight thin hair, but your hair is no longer straight, get something for wavy hair.
, This will clean any buildup of products on your hair and scalp.
 Maybe your scalp has gotten 'greasy' and your hair hasn't really changed at all.
 Getting a permanent and/or dying your hair will change its texture. Possibly to something you are more familiar with.
 But not too much, it will make it too greasy.
