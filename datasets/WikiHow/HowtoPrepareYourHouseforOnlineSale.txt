, The realistic price matters because financial institutions will agree to lend money to a buyer for the purchase based on the realistic price, not an over-inflated one.
 Look for sites that permit at least one photo free of charge. It makes good sense to list on more than one site too; select multiple free real estate listing sites.
 Include pictures of yard features, the hot water tank, heating and cooling technique, fuse box and water pipes under sinks, if possible. Measure the rooms and porch area. Note down the square footage in each room, and use this in your listing information. Note the square living footage; real estate listing appraisers tend to base market value on this, when measuring a room.
