Make sure that everything else is cut before you continue with this step. Cutting meat on the same cutting board as the vegetables can contaminate the vegetables and cause food poisoning or other sickness.
, Add garlic and soy sauce to the bowl of chicken and mix thoroughly. Let that sit and marinate for about 15 minutes., Mix thoroughly with a whisk or a fork., Once the pan is hot add mixture and wait about six to seven minutes. Watch the eggs throughout this, lowering heat and poking small holes into it with the spatula in order to let the uncooked liquid into the heat.

Right before it is fully cooked, cut the egg into quarters and one by one flipping the quarters to let the other side cook. This side will cook much faster so be ready to remove it in about 30 seconds. Once removed put it onto a plate. Slice the egg into small one-inch pieces, as shown in the picture. Don't wash the pan yet; you will need it again later on.
