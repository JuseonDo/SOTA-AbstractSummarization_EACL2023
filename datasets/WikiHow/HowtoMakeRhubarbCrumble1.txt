 Make sure that the rack is located in the center of the oven.
 If you have not yet done so, chop off the leaves, and discard them promptly in the trash. Then, trim the bottom off of the stalks, and rinse them well. Pat the stalks dry, then chop them into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) long pieces.Be sure to cut the leaves off completely. While the stalk is edible, the leaves themselves are toxic, and can make you very sick.
 Place the rhubarb into a medium-sized mixing bowl, then add 1¼ cups (280 grams) of granulated sugar and ¼ cup (25 grams) of all-purpose flour. If you'd like to add a hint of extra flavor to your filling, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and/or ¼ teaspoon of ground cardamom or cinnamon. Stir everything together with a rubber spatula until the rhubarb is evenly coated.
 Make sure that the mixture gets into the corners of the dish as well. Set the dish aside while you prepare the crumble topping.
 In a clean mixing bowl, stir together 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour, 1 cup (200 grams) of light brown sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt. If you own a food processor, you can save lots of time by pulsing the ingredients in it for a few seconds.
 If you are using a food processor to do this, pulse it a few times until you get pea-sized clumps. If you don't own a food processor, you can cut the ingredients together using two knives or a pastry cutter.
 Make sure that the topping mixture is spread evenly across the top of the rhubarb. You don't want to see any gaps.
 It is ready when the filling turns bubbly and the topping golden brown.
 You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it with some whipped cream or even vanilla ice cream.
