 The container should be large enough to fit your wine glass. The soft cloth is important, as it will help protect the wine glass from getting scratched.


This method is great for glasses that have turned foggy. It is also good for tough wine stains.
Do not use this one painted or glittered wine glasses. Soaking these glasses in water for long periods of time can cause the paint or glitter to flake off.
 Use just enough water so that the wine glass will be covered if you put it in.
 The vinegar will dissolve any wine or mineral residue. If you can't find any vinegar, you can use some baking soda or washing soda instead. Make sure that the washing soda or baking soda are completely dissolved; any remaining specks may scratch the glass.Washing soda will help remove cloudiness, but it may not remove wine stains. Baking soda will work the same way, just not as well.
 The wine glass should be completely submerged. If it isn't, add some more warm water.
, Hold the glass by the bowl. Do not hold it by the stem, especially if it is a crystal wine glass. The stem is very fragile, and may break. If the wine glass is still foggy, it is possible that the damage is permanent. Wine glasses, especially those made from crystal, often turn foggy if they are washed in the dishwasher., Spread the cloth over your table or counter. Set the wine glass upside down on it. If you live in an area that has hard water, you might want to dry the glass off by hand using a soft, lint-free cloth instead.
