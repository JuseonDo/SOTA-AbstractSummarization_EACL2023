recognise the symptoms of fainting.

@summary
if you begin to experience any of these, tell your teacher or another adult near by.

@summary
your teacher should send you to the medical room, office or nurse, (depends on the school).

@summary
when you arrive at the nurse, don't feel embarrassed to answer her questions.

@summary
in the event of you actually fainting in class, don't get upset.

@summary
you will probably get sent home.

@summary
in the event you hurt yourself or your faint warrants a hospital visit in an ambulance, don't worry.

 These include Dizziness, blurry vision, fuzzy hearing or ringing in ears, feeling hot, feeling sick, upset stomach, sweating, tiredness, tingling hands, hyperventilation, tunnel vision, unsteadiness and fear.;
, Alternatively, let a friend know and let them get you help.
 Make sure, if your teacher doesn't send someone with you, that you ask. This applies, especially, if you have to climb or go down stairs on your way. If you fainted on the stairs, you could seriously hurt yourself

, The first thing she'll probably do is Â lie you flat. It may feel strange, but she's seen this before. Answer any questions she has honestly and don't lie. Example: If she asks you if you had breakfast and you didn't, don't say you did so she doesn't lecture you.
 If other kids stare at you, don't feel embarrassed. You can deal with that later. In the mean time, think about them in your position.
 If you do, and your parents ask questions, answer them honestly.
 Other kids will most likely be concerned for your health than anything else. Again, think of them in your position.
