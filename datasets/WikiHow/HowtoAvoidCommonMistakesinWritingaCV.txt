 Try using a variety of different words to show your wide range of writing skills.

, Set the margins evenly on both sides of the page and give proper spaces between each heading. Use verbs in a consistent manner. For example, if you are describing your past job, all verbs should be in the past tense.
, A professional profile is basically a short statement at the start of a CV which gives an overview of your key personal and professional qualities.
 Put your education and qualification before your employment history (as required), for example.
 Employers don’t have time to read large paragraphs. They have to review and pick out the information quickly.
 Your CV should always accompany one. A cover letter is a sales document that gives an overview of the position being applied for, and how your skills and qualifications match the requirements of the position.
 For example, write your most recent information first, followed by the previous information and then the oldest.
 They’re just a waste of space and they often get bothered.
