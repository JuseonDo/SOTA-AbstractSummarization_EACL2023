@summary
purchase 30 grams of strong tasty cheese, such as parmesan or cheddar.
@article
 Mix the butter with 1 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper (or add pepper to taste). Finely grate the cheese and add to the pepper butter, alternatively, you may blend cheese and butter in a food processor and add pepper once the cheese is blended. Wrap and chill for 48 hours for the flavours to infuse.


This butter is delicious with anything that you would like a cheese-like savoury taste, as well as a spicy peppery bite.
