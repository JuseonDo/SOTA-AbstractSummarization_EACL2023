, You should see several things going on. It'll open to a page where you'll be able to scan all of the QR codes and barcodes that exist on most products and all store shelves.
 Make sure the scanner has sufficient light and all of the barcode is in sight of the lens. The app will readjust the light to focus in on the code, if it recognizes the overall design as being that of an accepted code.


Realize that while a Microsoft Tag code looks similar to a QR code in style, ScanLife can't read it. Microsoft Tags can only be read on the Microsoft Tag app.
 If you scan a QR code, you'll be asked whether or not you'd like to visit the webpage the code is asking the user to view. If it's a barcode, you'll be taken directly to the NexTag site for the product with the barcode you've scanned.
 This is where you'll see all of your other recent code-scans.
 Although this will rarely change when viewed minute-by-minute, it will change in a day-by-day form (unless you've got very active friends who use ScanLife a lot).
