 wikiHow's mobile site is not geared towards full-blown editing, so a good deal of the editing tools that are present on the full site are not present on your mobile.


If your Touch is constantly reverting over to the mobile site, try these steps:

Log out.
Go into "Settings"
Go into "Safari"
Clear your "cache" and "cookies".
Type in http://wikiHow.com for the website address and you will be taken to the mobile site.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the button that says "full site".
Log in and voila! You're officially in the non-mobile site.
