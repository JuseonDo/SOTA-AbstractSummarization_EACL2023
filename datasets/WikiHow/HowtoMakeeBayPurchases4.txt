,,, If any of these details might change your mind on bidding, go back to searching for a different listing.
 By asking questions you have a chance to get to know the seller prior to the transaction. The response time and the quality of the response is a good gauge of how the sale will go. Ask the seller any questions regarding the item or the seller's policies.
 The ‘Buy It Now’ option will skip the bidding process and purchase the item for the specified price. Once bidding has started on an item the ‘Buy It Now’ option will become unavailable. Consider the time left on the auction when deciding whether to bid or ‘Buy It Now.’ If an item has just a little time until auction close you will probably win the item cheaper through bidding.
