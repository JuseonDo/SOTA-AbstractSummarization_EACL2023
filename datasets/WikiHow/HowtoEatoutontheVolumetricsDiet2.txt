 Whole grain cereals, fruit and low-fat dairy are all good choices for a healthy breakfast.
 Alternatively, you can ask the waiter or waitress not to bring the bread course at all.
 Avoid mayonnaise-drenched pasta salads at a salad bar and build a healthful salad with plenty of greens, colorful vegetables, lean protein and low-fat dressing.
 Choose low-CD alternatives like seafood, grilled vegetables or melon with prosciutto.
 Find out if a dish can be grilled or broiled or served with sauce on the side. Order veggie pizza and ask for less cheese.
 Add salsa to baked potatoes instead of butter or sour cream. Have brown rice instead of white rice.
