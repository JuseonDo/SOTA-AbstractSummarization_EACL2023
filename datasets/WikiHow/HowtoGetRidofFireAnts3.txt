@summary
locate the colony (the mound will be impossible to miss), and fence this area immediately.

@summary
treat the colony (or colonies) with individual mound treatments or baits.

@summary
for quick results, use an insecticide that can be dissolved in water (follow the directions on the container), and drench the mound with the product.

@summary
if your fire ant problem isn’t too urgent, you can try using baits because they control colonies even when the mounds are not visible; however, it takes weeks to see results.

 You need to make sure that members of your family, including pets, don't access this area as they have a higher chance of being bitten once they are close to the nest.


Remember to inspect bushes, pipes, or sidewalk edges as ants like to build their nests near structures.
 You can use over-the-counter insecticides, or, for more severe cases, buy products from a professional.
 You can also use a granular insecticide that can be applied with water. While these insecticides kill the ants that are underground, you need to apply one to two gallons of insecticide to each mound to kill the entire colony.


Make sure that you wear gloves to prevent chemical burns.
Follow directions on the insecticide labels. If you don’t use enough water, you will not exterminate the ants; they will just relocate.
 Apply baits to the ground when no rain is expected for the next 24 hours.


Apply baits when the worker ants are searching for food. To determine when they are searching for food, leave a piece of food by the mound. If you observe ants around the food within 10-30 minutes, begin applying the bait.
Always follow the directions on the product labels. Keep in mind that it might take you five to ten weeks to see results when using baits; however, this treatment can last up to a year and is a long term solution for controlling fire ants.
