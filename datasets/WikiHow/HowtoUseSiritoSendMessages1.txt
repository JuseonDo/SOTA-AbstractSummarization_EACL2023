 If your phone supports it, you may also launch Siri by saying “Hey Siri.”


If you don’t hear two quick beeps (or see “What can I help you with?” on the screen), open your iPhone’s Settings, tap Siri, and slide the “Siri” switch to the On (green) position.;
,, Siri should respond with, “What do you want to say?”


If Siri doesn’t recognize the name, she will say “I couldn’t find <name> in your contacts. To whom shall I send it?” Try a different name, or say a phone number., When you stop speaking, Siri will display the message and ask, “Ready to send?”


If you aren’t satisfied with the message, say “Change it” to start again, or “Add <whatever you want to add>” to add another line.



You can also combine these steps into one statement. For example, you could say “Text Sarah I’m on my way.”
