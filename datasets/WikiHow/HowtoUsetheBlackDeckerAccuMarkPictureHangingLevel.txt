 Locate the tabs that are on the back of the picture that are used to hang the picture. The rubber grips will keep it from sliding.;
, Line each adjustable marker up perfectly with the tabs.
 Because the level has rubber grips on the back, you can actually hold the level with one hand, and it should not slip. You simply need to apply a small amount of pressure. The rubber grips should hold the level in place and not leave any marks on the wall.
 You can make the mark with one hand while you are holding the level with the other hand. The level is very lightweight and easy to handle.
 You may use nails, screws, or other types of hangers.
 Because you have used this picture hanging level, the picture should be perfectly level.
