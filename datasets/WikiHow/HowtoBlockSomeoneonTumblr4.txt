 By default, all Tumblr blogs are public and can be seen by anyone. If you want to use Tumblr as more of a private diary, consider creating a new blog and locking it with a password.


It is not possible to lock your primary Tumblr blog with a password.
You can either create a new secondary blog with a password or password-protect an existing secondary blog.
If you already have a secondary blog you want to protect, click the Profile icon (the person’s head) in the Dashboard, then click “Settings.” Click your secondary blog name, then scroll to the bottom to switch “Password protect this blog” to the On position. Enter your blog’s new password when prompted.
 You’ll need to create a new blog to protect it with a password.
 A text box will appear.
 If you choose something that’s already in use, Tumblr will prompt you to select a new URL.
 This password can be changed later.
 Only people whom you give the password to will be able to view this blog.
