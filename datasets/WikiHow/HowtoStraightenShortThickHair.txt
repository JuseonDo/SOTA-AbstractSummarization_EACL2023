 If your hair is going to stay straightened and look nice,Â it will need to be clean. Hop in the shower and wash it.;
, Depending on how long your hair is, you will need more or less shampoo. Use enough to thoroughly coat your hair, but no so much that it's an excessive amount.
, Use enough to coat your hair. Once it's on all of your hair, run your fingers through the hair strands, then let it set while you wash your body. The additional time helps to leave your hair soft and voluminous.
, Doing this reduces the amount of frizz and breakage.
 Using a flat iron on wet hair can burn it, causing more problems. Brush out your hair with a comb, then dry it using a hair dryer.
 Put a small amount on your finger tips and rub your hands together, then apply it about halfway down your hair.
 Thick hair can be a pain to dry without taking up a lot of time, so put it up in layers. Use either a crocodile clip or a hair tie and tie up separate layers of hair.
 Once that's done, move on to the next layer and so on, until all of the hair is dry.
 Make sure that all of your hair is dry.
 This will make things a lot easier.
 While you're waiting, spray some heat-protectant spray on your hair, so that the heat doesn't damage it.
 Slide the flat iron down the strand of hair, going from root to tip. Do this about three times, then move on.
 Continue until all of your hair is straightened.
 Then style it as you like, or leave it as it is!
