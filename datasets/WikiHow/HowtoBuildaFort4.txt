 Christmas lights work well. Choose lights that appeal to you. You can string up big outdoor style stringed lights or little multi colored lights. Make sure you set it up near an outlet. This will add a whole new dimension to your fort, and you'll be able to use it at night.
 You can draw pictures on the cardboard walls, or pin pictures to your sheet fort, or put a little wood sculpture in your wood fort. Try to be creative. Art will make your fort have more character and feel more like a home.
 The couch fort works well for this, since you can put the TV on the couch set and then lay in front of it.
 Forts are always more fun with friends. Building a fort is more fun with friends too, so you should consider including people in the whole process.
