 Every time you report to the Dark Brotherhood after a murder, you get around 100-200 coin.

Complete the dark brotherhood; it gives you 20,000 gold.
 Joining factions means doing quests, and quests usually are fair pay (depending on the person and quest)., Interact with them and they will usually bet you about 100 coins for a brawl. If you have the gloves that give you an extra 10 damage per strike you can down them in a couple of blows.
