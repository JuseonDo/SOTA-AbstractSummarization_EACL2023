,, One of the Turn Blocks contains a vine, that reaches to an alternative route. If you have a cape, you can fly up and collect another Yoshi coin and regular coins. Choose the main route and find a question block with a Big Boo.
 You will then find a lone Boo, another pair of Circling Boo Buddies, a Coin Block (10 regular coins) and a Yoshi coin on top of the block.
 As you are in a room of Big Bubbles, look for 3 blocks. The middle one contains a "P-Switch". Carry the P-Switch with you, and through the regular door. While avoiding Boos, continue carrying it into you see an outline of coins in the shape of a door. Still carrying the P-Switch, jump up to collect all of the coins.
 You should now be able to enter the door. The Goal Gate can be seen and the level is completed.
