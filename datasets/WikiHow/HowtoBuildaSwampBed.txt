 They should be well spaced.


If you cannot find trees in that formation, cut enough stable pole, (e.g., bamboo). or thin logs to make four tripods. Tie them securely. Position them in the mud so that they form a rectangle big enough to hold your body and your equipment.;
, Use string, wire, reeds, vines, or whatever else is available. Make sure that the sticks are evenly positioned and well above the ground or water. (Keep in mind that the water may rise.)

, Lay sturdy sticks across the horizontal sticks, taking care that they are strong enough to hold your weight. If you have enough string, vine, etc., available, tie the sticks in place for added sturdiness.
 If you don't have fabric available, use broad leaves and/or grass instead.
 You will have an easier rest than being on the ground, and be less likely to be bothered by animals and creepy crawlies.
