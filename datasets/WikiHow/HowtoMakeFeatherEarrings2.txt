@article
 Locate the holes towards the tops of the feathers, but not too close to the edges (otherwise they risk ripping).;
, Use the pliers for this part; if you have two pairs, you can hold the ring in one pair and use the other pair to open it up.
 There should be two rings for each feather, to allow for some room between the hook and the feather itself.
 You should now have two feathers ready to be attached to the French hooks.
 Slide each one onto each outer jump ring, then clamp them closed with your pliers. The feathers should now dangle from the hooks.
 You're done!
