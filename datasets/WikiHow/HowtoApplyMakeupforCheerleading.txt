 Rinse with cold water. Apply a matching moisturizer and wait for 5 minutes so the moisturizer can sink in. If you don't know what your skin type is, wash with an acne moisturizer and use oil free lotion.;
, Dot some on your forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose. Blend the dots outwards.
 If you have any blemishes (spots, insect bites, etc.) apply concealer directly onto the blemish, then dab with your finger until it fades into your skin. Do not rub, as this causes a ring around the blemish making it more obvious.
 Gently brush your face for an even application, but use a little more if a particular area is shiny.
 Apply it under your cheekbones and on your temples. Use a little down the sides of your nose. Avoid shimmery bronzer if you do not know how to apply it and blend it into your skin so that it matches your skin tone well.
 Then use white or cream to highlight the tear duct and your brow bone. You can also use a darker color, like dark brown, to accentuate your crease, which is the gap between your lid and brow bone, and your lash line.
 It is best to use gel eyeliner because it is easy to apply, and also does not smudge if you sweat. Choose one that is black, black-brown, or your team colors. Apply it only on the lash line.
 Make sure to use waterproof mascara in black or black-brown.
