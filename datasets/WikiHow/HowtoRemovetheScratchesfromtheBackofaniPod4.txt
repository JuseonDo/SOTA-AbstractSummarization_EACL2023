 If your iPod’s back is badly damaged, buff out the deep gouges with the provided metal refinishing pad. If your iPod only contains minor scratches, skip this step.

Rub the iPod’s back and forth across the pad 20 times. Vary the motions.
Assess the iPod’s surface.
Repeat as needed.,,,, If you aren’t satisfied with the results, repeat steps 2 through 5 as needed. If you are happy with the results, proceed to step 6., Ice Creme A (and the metal refinishing pad) are abrasive and will leave behind hairline scratches. Ice Creme B will reduce the appearance of these minor blemishes while restoring your iPod’s glossy finish.,,,, If you aren’t satisfied with the results, repeat steps 6 through 9 as needed. If you are happy with the results, pack up the supplies and enjoy your glossy iPod.
