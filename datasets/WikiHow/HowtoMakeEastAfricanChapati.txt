,, (With a food processor, this process can be quickened up. Please check in the instruction manual, regarding whether the machine can mix stiff dough of 1 kilo flour (just over 2lb) + other ingredients (basically 1/2 liter of water). If not, try halving ALL ingredients).
 Cut the dough into 8 - 10 equal pieces.
 If properly mixed, even without a powdered rolling board, the dough should not be too soft or sticky. If it is, add some little flour until it is not. The consistency may vary, depending on the type of wheat flour used.
 Carefully insert a chapati and wait until the lower side just starts to dry up. Turn it over and spread about 1 - 2 teaspoons of oil all over the surface as the lower side dries up lightly. After a few moments, turn the chapati over and repeat the same process. If the hotplate is not too hot, the lower side should turn golden brown after 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Do the same for the other side. If they brown too fast or show signs of burning without getting ready, reduce the heat. The ready chapati should feel soft and have lightly browned patches (see picture).
 At such a pace, the total preparation time, should be about one hour.
