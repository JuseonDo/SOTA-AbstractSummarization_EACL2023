,

@summary

;
,, Glue the foam hearts and fake flowers all over the box, with the markers, draw a sign-up sheet on one side of the box and write "We love Our Webkinz!" and "Webkinz Rule" etc. Be sure to write the Club's name and "Webkinz ONLY" on the door!

, On the walls, draw a computer, a TV, and maybe a Treadmill. Be creative!

, Put Easter grass, or rags, or maybe old baby blankets down on the "floor" of your clubhouse.
 Why not invite your friends and their Webkinz over so their Webkinz can sign up and become official clubhouse members!!
