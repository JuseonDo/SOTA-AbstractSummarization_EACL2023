chose your pokémon wisely.

@summary
also, choose a way you will defeat your challengers, two ways are having one pokémon that is the strongest/gets to fight all the strongest trainers,this is a good method because it will have that pokémon get the most training and all the exp.points - then use the others as back up.

@summary
another good method is simply train all your pokémon equally, have them all roughly around the same level (1, 2 3 or 4 difference)however this could take long and waste a lot of time, you have to have patience and an excepting heart for constant failing pokémon.

@article
 It will always tell you what type all 8 of the gym leaders use. For instance, the manual in Pokémon Diamond tells you what type of Pokémon the gym leaders use.;
, Don't get a fire type Pokémon that will evolve into a fighting type if there are a water, ground, flying, and psychic gyms.
 However this method could backfire, if for example you have a strong fire type that like 10 or more levels higher then the rest and they are "KO'd" you will have to keep using revives and revival herbs that are super expensive or simply defeat Pokémon with levels and moves 20 times strongest and faster then your own.
, Before a gym battle or Team Rocket, Magma, Aqua, or Team Galactic, go in a grass area. Battle the wild Pokémon until you level your Pokémon up.You can choose to battle Pokémon with slightly lower levels then you own but takes a while to level up or to a grass area with Pokémon tougher then your own, you get Exp. points quicker but you might get knocked out a lot and loose lots of money buying potions and healers.
, It will raise your Exp. level, make sure your well prepared with lots of status healers and potions and even though you beat them once, it still can be hard again...
