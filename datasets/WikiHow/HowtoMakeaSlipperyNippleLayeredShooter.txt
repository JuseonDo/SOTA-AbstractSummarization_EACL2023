Estimate the capacity (volume) the shot glass or cordial glass. This can be done by eye or with measuring cups. The Sambuca will take up a about three-fourths of the glass, and the Baileys Irish Cream will take up about one fourth of the glass. The grenadine will take up a negligible amount of the glass. You don't want to overfill the glass, so leave a little extra space.;
,,, This can be done by pouring just a little bit of grenadine into a small measuring cup (such as a jigger) and, while holding the cup a few inches or more above the top of the cordial or shot glass, drip the grenadine onto the Baileys. The grenadine needs to pick up a little speed on its may down to the Baileys so that it can impact the layer of Baileys and form the nipple shape.
