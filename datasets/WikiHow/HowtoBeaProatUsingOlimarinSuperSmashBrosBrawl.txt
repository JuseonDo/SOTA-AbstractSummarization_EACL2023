 White Pikmin are the most powerful when latched onto an opponent, with their poison dealing a great deal of damage, but are killed in one hit.;
, By using Pikmin Throw of his side-smash off a ledge is a good tactic, but it is more efficient to jump into water (such as on Delfino Plaza) which will kill off all but Blue Pikmin.
 If you keep your Pikmin alive for a while, they will become Bud Pikmin and then Flower Pikmin. It takes twenty seconds for each stage. This slightly boosts knockback and damage.
 His up-tilt is a powerful multi-hit move, as well as his up-air. His side smash is exceptionally powerful when used with a Yellow Pikmin or Purple Pikmin. Pikmin Throw is good for long-range. His down-air is a powerful spike.
