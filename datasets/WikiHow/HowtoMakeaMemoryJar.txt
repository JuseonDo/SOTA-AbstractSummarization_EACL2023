 Make sure it is big enough to fit about three golf balls in as a rough estimate. It is okay if it exceeds the estimate, the more memories that can fit in, the better! You can buy some good glass jars from most good supermarkets.;
, Use anything you like and if you wish, use something that is a memory itself like used wrapping paper from a special gift or a scrap of wallpaper from a favourite room. After all, it is a memory jar!

, Add some lace, bows, buttons, beads or whatever you think looks good. Give it a personal touch by choosing your favourite colours.
 Using scissors, cut out a piece of blank, coloured or patterned paper and write your name and 'memory jar' on it. Add any other details or pieces of information you find necessary

, Begin by using the felt, wrapping or craft paper to adorn the jar.
 These are the items like the lace and bows.
 Choose similar colours and themes for the best results.
 Place the label on one middle side of your jar.
 Remember, don't open till the next year!
