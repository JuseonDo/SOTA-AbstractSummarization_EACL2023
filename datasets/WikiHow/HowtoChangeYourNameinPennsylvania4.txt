 When both biological parents agree to change their child’s name, they don’t have to do it through the court system. There is a form located on the back of every child’s birth certificate for this purpose.Both biological parents must sign this form to show their agreement.
 You must include a legible copy of one parent’s government-issued ID card with the form. If you want the original birth certificate returned to you, you also must include a $4 fee. The only exception is if you provide proof of membership in the Armed Forces. In that case, you don’t have to pay the $4 fee., You can use the new birth certificate to change your child’s name with the Social Security Administration. You also should show the new birth certificate to other offices that need the child’s correct name, such as his or her school and doctor’s office.
