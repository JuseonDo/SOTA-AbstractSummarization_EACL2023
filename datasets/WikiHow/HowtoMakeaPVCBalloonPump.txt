 This pipe is where we will start the pump. Mark 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the end of the pipe and another 1 inch (2.5 cm) after that mark. Place it in a table cutter and clamp the pipe. Adjust the blades just halfway of the sides of the pipe. Start the cutter and cut the marks. Use your left hand to rotate the pipe and your right hand to hold the pipe as a help for the clamp. Get 2 pieces of #219 O-rings and insert it onto the cut marks. Get a 1" plug and insert it into the pipe (where two o-rings are located) with PVC glue.;
, Clean up the piston to wipe out the excess glue.
 It is too long because it is 26 inches (66.0 cm). This will be the handles we will use later on. Paint all the fittings with blue and black or desired colour, except for the pump.
 First, insert the coupling into the bushing and insert the bigger pipe to that and make sure it goes to the bottom.
 But, don't attach it yet to the body (Step 4).
 Insert it into the bigger pipe. Cement the cap on top when inserted and left 2 inches (5.1 cm) where we will attach the handles.


If you wonder how I make the cap, just bore a hole in a 1-1/4 Slip Cap. Insert the #320 O-ring into the side (just the side, not the centre) and use lubricating jelly and insert into the pipe with the pump in the centre and this will be the cap.
 Now, make a One-Way valve to make it a really pump.
 3/4 in. PVC FIPT x FIPT x FIPT Tee will be inserted into the bushing right now. Make sure that it also has a thread tape.
