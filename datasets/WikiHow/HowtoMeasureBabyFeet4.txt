 For U.K. and Euro sizing, for example, you could use one like this: http://www.mothercare.com/how-to-measure-your-child%27s-feet/buyersguide-ms-clothing-sub4,default,pg.html.


Make sure your print scale is set to “none” or “100%.”

, It should be 220 millimeters.
 Each sizing guide will have its own directions, but generally, you’ll have your child step on the guide and measure from the tip of the big toe.
 Depending on where you live, you may need to convert your measurements for appropriate sizing. If, for example, you live in the U.S. but have a U.K. / Euro sizing guide, you’ll need to translate your results to an American size. There are conversation charts online (for example, http://www.healthyfeetstore.com/kids-shoe-sizing-guide-with-sizing-chart.html).
