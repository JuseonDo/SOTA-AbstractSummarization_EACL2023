 Some soldiers in WWI described it as pepper and pineapple.If you are exposed to chlorine gas, you may have trouble breathing or seeing and will feel a burning sensation.;

If indoors, exit the building as quickly as possible.
If outdoors, move to the highest ground. Since chlorine gas is more dense than air, it will sink to the ground.
 Hold it up to your nose as a mask. The Canadian military survived the first large-scale chlorine gas attack in WWI by using urine instead of water, under the presumption that the urine crystallizes the gas, Cut the clothes off so that they don't need to make additional contact with your skin as they're peeled off. Seal the clothes in plastic bags.
 Rinse your eyes with water if your vision is blurred or your eyes burn; if you wear contact lenses, throw them away. However, water mixed with Chlorine gas can turn into Hydrochloric acid, so be careful.
