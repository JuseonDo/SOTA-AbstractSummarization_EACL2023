 Chop it into small pieces. Dispose of most of the leaves but keep some back.;
, Fry without allowing it to go brown, over low heat, for about 5 minutes.
 Stir occasionally to prevent the celery or onion from browning.
 Place the lid on the pot or saucepan. Allow to simmer for 30 minutes. The celery should be tender at the end of the simmering.
 Allow to cool a little. Pour the soup into a blender or a processor. Puree it until smooth. Season to taste.
 Reheat very gently; you don't want it to get hot, just nicely warmed.
 You can sprinkle grated cheese on the bowl if wished, or some chopped celery leaves from those you've kept back.
