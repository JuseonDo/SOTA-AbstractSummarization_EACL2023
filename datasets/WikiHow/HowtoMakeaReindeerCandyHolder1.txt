 Choose the size according to how many candies you'd like to fit into the container.;
, Spray paint with brown paint to completely cover the container.


Allow to dry completely.
 This serves as the reindeer's nose.
 These can be done either by painting them on by hand or gluing on large googly eyes, whichever you prefer.
 Cut out antler shapes from red colored cardboard. Glue these at the back of the container. Allow to dry.


It is best to make two antler shapes coming out of one piece of card, so that you only have to glue one piece of card on the container. It will be less likely to get knocked when the candies are tipped in and drawn out.
 Make some more containers if you would like to give them to children at the end of the party.
