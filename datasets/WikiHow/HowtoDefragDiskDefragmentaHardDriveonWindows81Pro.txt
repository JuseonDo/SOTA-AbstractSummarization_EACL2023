, In this box is a title called "Change Desktop Icons", which can be found towards the top left hand side of the box. Click on it.
 At the top of this box you will find 5 check box's, make sure all of them are checked and click apply at the bottom of the box. You can now close that Box and the Personalisation box as well.
 These are a handy addition to the navigation of Windows 8, which most users find hard to do.
 You are now faced with the Windows 8 file explorer in a desktop environment. You want to right click on your primary Hard Drive that the Operating System is running off, which will most likely be the (C:) Drive. Once you have right clicked on the (C:) Drive scroll down to the "Properties" option at the bottom of the drop down menu and Click on it.
 You will also notice 6 tabs across the top of the screen as well as an option to the bottom right of the pie chat.
 This is not the de-frag but is an option to clean up some of the files that are casing un-necessary space on the Hard Drive. Once it has finished calculating a box will appear with a few check boxes, make sure all of them are checked and click "OK".And then "Delete Files".
 Once this has been done, you will see the option called "Optimise and Defragment Drive" With a button called Optimise, click on that.
 In this window, you will see a list of all the drives currently connected to the computer and its status on the far right alongside its media type and last run.
 This had a blue and yellow shield next to it which indicates that Administrator permissions will be required and it will prompt you continue the operation.
