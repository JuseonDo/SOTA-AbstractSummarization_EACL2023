 It needs to be of sufficient size to accommodate your Easter treats.


Choose the color you like best. Or make a whole set and choose a variety of colors.;
, Hot glue a cotton ball towards the bottom of the Easter egg.


Draw two long bunny ears on some copy paper. Cut them out with safety scissors. You won't be adding these just yet; use them as the template to shape the pipe cleaners.






Take two small, thin, pipe cleaners. Bend them into bunny's ear shapes following the shape of the paper ear backs, then hot glue the pipe cleaner ears in place. Add them towards the top of the Easter egg.
 Using a permanent marker (preferably Sharpie Brand), draw a smiling mouth and a bunny nose.
 Hot glue two googly eyes on the bunny's head where eyes would be best placed.
 Use scotch tape to tape each side of the bunny ears to the back of the pipe cleaner ears. Keep this as neat as possible., Inside the bunny put some chocolate eggs or other Easter treats. Include a little Post-it note saying "Happy Easter!" and maybe a little picture on you've hand drawn.
