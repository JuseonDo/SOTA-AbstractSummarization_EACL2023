 Rinse them off under cool water to remove any dirt.
 Score the shells before you place them in a pan.
 Place the flat sides of the chestnuts down.
 Make sure that there's a bed of glowing coals that you can rest the pan on, whether you've lit a fireplace or a campfire.
 This should be enough to roast one side of the chestnuts. Lightly shake the pan around every minute or so to distribute the heat.
 After five minutes, use a potholder to remove the pan, roll over the nuts, and place them back on the fire.
, Once you've roasted the nuts, wait 2-3 minutes for them to cool down and enjoy them while they're nice and hot.
