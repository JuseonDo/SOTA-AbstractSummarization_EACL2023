 In particular, if you are in a boat and would like to secure your boat to a pole or piling, this is the way to do it. It also work for securing a rope to a pole on any occasion (it could even work for hanging up a hammock.), The running end is the end of the rope that is not connected to your boat, horse, etc. It is the end you will use to form the knot. Make a large, loose loop with the running end so that the tip of the rope hangs over the standing end (the part of the rope that your knot gets tied around.
 It should go over the standing end and then back up from under the standing end.
 The tip should then continue up through the hole and around itself (around the straight part of the rope that leads to the loop you formed.)

, The tip should go down into the loop after you have sent it up and over itself. Pull the tip through so that it pokes out of the hole for a couple of inches.
 Pulling on the standing end will slide the knot up to the pole.
