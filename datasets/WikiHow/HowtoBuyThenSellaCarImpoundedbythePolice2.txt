 If you choose to purchase a car at a live auction, arrive at the auction early. This will give you time to read any rules regarding the bidding process and preview the vehicles.


Choose the vehicles you want to bid on. Keep track of where the vehicles you are interested in are located, and the times for the auctions that are selling those vehicles.
Create a schedule for yourself based on when each auction you want to attend is taking place. Determine when to take a lunch break, and stay organized so you don't miss one of the auctions you are planning on attending.
 If you are attending a website auction, understand how the auction site operates and learn the site rules before bidding on a vehicle.
 Whether you are attending a live auction or an Internet auction, set a spending limit prior to the start of the auction to help you control costs.


Calculate the costs for shipping the vehicle, the cost of any repairs, necessary cleaning costs, and advertising expenses for reselling the vehicle before you bid on it.
 Watch the auction for higher bids and make additional bids that are within your maximum bid limits.



Ask when you will receive the title for the vehicle. You won't be able to resell the vehicle until you have the title. If you attend a live auction, you should receive the title at the time of purchase. If you attend an Internet auction, ask the seller to send the title to you by the fastest postal means available.
