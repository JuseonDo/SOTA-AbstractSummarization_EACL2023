 Find a medium sized diaper bag that has both a long strap and short straps. This makes it easy to carry across your chest while carrying your child.;
, The plane might be very chilly compared to the summery airport, or vice versa. Light, easy to manage layers help travel.
 Some carry diapers on board or even bottle warmers. (However, keep in mind your plane may be changed last-minute).
 For instance, if your flight is 4 hours long, pack 8 diapers. Pack package of wipes. These will come in handy for accidents on both them and you.
 Be sure to bring any bottles, sippy cups, spoons, and the like too.
 It both feeds and entertains. Make sure they are easy to manage like round oat cereal, rice cakes.
 Do not use the airplane blankets, as they are seldom if ever washed.
 There are disposable cloths that can be purchased for this purpose.
, Bring gas drops, gripe water, Tylenol, or anything else your child might need. Also don't forget rash cream if needed.
 Accidents do happen and if they do, take the clean clothes out and put the dirty ones in.
 Bring amusements that fit easily in your diaper bag. A small inflatable beach ball, a hand fan, finger puppets, board books, sparkly fabric, and the like will keep fussing down. It may help if the toy is new.
, Chewing gum, hot washcloths, plastic cups, and something to suck on all help.
