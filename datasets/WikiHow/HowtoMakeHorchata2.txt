 Tiger nuts can be tricky to find. You can order them online or find them at an African grocery store., The water should cover the nuts by at least two inches., The nuts have to rehydrate, and because they can be so difficult to find, they may be older and take longer to become useable.,, This should take about two minutes, depending on your blender., Use a spoon or spatula to stir the mixture as you strain, keeping any large particles from keeping the liquid from passing through the cloth.Gather the top of the cheesecloth and squeeze out any remaining liquid., Use a large spoon or whisk to mix the horchata until sugar and salt have dissolved completely.You can substitute honey, simple syrup, agave, or other sweeteners for sugar if you wish.
