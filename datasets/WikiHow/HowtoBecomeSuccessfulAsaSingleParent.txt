 As a single parent you will encounter many challenges, struggles, and joys. Facing and going through these experiences might change your outlook on life, either in a positive or a negative way. Keeping a positive attitude is key in becoming a successful single parent.;
, Don’t worry about the little things like dirty hands or dishes; you will get to them. You want to be able to spend all the time you can with your child/ren playing, teaching and learning in a positive setting.
 They need to know that you believe they are the most important thing in your life. Show them and tell them how special they are each and every day.
 If your family or friends can't watch your child/ren, make sure you research the daycare places you are looking into. Check their backgrounds and ask all the needed questions; this will help provide a safe environment for your child/ren.
 If family members and/or friends are willing to help, don’t turn them down, thinking that you can raise your child/ren on your own. Any extra help from people you trust will help with the challenges that arise.
 This schedule should focus on making time for your child/ren and work. Then pencil in other priorities and activities.
 Remember: you are not only working for your needs and wants, but your child’s as well. You want to be able to provide your child/ren with the best life and that requires money in most societies.
 Go to your child/ren’s activities to show them that you support what they are doing. Be there for them when it doesn’t work out exactly the way they wanted to.
 Make talking to teachers a priority and then make sure you communicate with your child on ways they can improve their education. Children need to see that home to school connection so that they take it seriously.
 This time might be taking a relaxing bath, watching your favorite television show, or spending the day at the spa with your friends. Whatever it is, make sure you are doing it for yourself.
