 They are available in zones two through eight. Since verbena seeds take a long time to germinate, you can save yourself time and space by starting with seedlings.


Buying the verbena plants allows you to ask the clerks how tall they grow and compare different colors. You can find verbena plants in white, red, purple, pink or multi-colored varieties.;
, Sew two seeds to every peat or fiber pot. Keep the soil damp but not overwatered.

 Verbena plants are prone to developing powdery mildew if they don’t get enough sun., Make sure that you are well past your last frost and the days are long.
 After you place them in the ground, fertilize the ground with flower fertilizer. Fertilize monthly for the rest of the growing season.
, Water once per week at the base of the plant, making sure they get about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water or rain. Allow the soil to dry out before the next watering.


Overwatering and watering from overhead are common mistakes with verbena care.
 Prune one-fourth of the plants top growth, include old flower blooms. Take care not to prune on the main stem.
 The next bloom will appear in 15 to 20 days. This practice will produce more blooms and wider plants.

Keep them in a container with as much sun as possible until you are ready to plant them in your beds.
 They will die with exposure to frost. Don’t overtrim them or they may not remain hardy.
