strive to enjoy friendships rather than be popular.

 People who reach their "peak of popularity" in high school, or talk about high school being the best part of their lives, sometimes have a steep fall when high school ends (they go nowhere).;
, Would you really want to be friends with those people? Do you really like what they stand for? How they treat others, and how they make others feel? Would you enjoy doing what they do, all the standard popular stuff, or would you prefer to have a little more depth and variety in your life?

, Value your friends by how much they add to your quality of life rather than how popular they are.
,, Usually, the cause of being "unpopular" is simply social ineptitude. Increasing your social skills will help you in all aspects of life.

 Sure you may go to "cool parties," but most likely those parties are full of drunks who are getting too drunk to escape the fact that they feel alone... and unpopular. You are stronger than that and you are at least facing the harshness of the facts and aim to deal with things positively.
 There really is no such thing as popularity. Kids that you think are popular just have a group of friends like you have a group of friends. Stick with your group of friends because to them you are popular.
 Sometimes when people are popular they get stabbed in the back by a million people, but when you stick to friends that you completely trust it's less likely you'll get stabbed in the back.
