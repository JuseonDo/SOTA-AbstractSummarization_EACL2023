 Consider pouring the sugar through a sifter to break up any clumps; this will make mixing easier later on.
 You can also use another liquid, such as lemon or orange juice, for a more flavorful glaze. If you choose to use juice instead of water or milk, then omit the extracts and food coloring in the next step.
 Vanilla or almond extract will enhance the flavor, while a few drops of food coloring can lend the glaze some color. Do not add extract or food coloring if you used juice instead of milk or water; both will clash with the natural flavor and color of the juice.
 You will end up with a thick, paste-like consistency.
 You can use the icing as is, or you can turn it into a glaze by adding more milk or water (or whatever type of liquid you used). The thinner the icing is, the easier it will be to pour or drizzle over cookies and cupcakes.
