 Don't use any avatar or your Yahoo! Avatar, because those are boring. Use a cool picture for your avatar. This will make people notice your answers.;
, For example, instead of being called hersheykiss123, just be called Hershey Kiss. Make sure it goes with your avatar.
 More people will be able to see your answers, so more people will want to be your fan.
