 You'll want to beat them for about 4 minutes, or until stiff peaks form.
, It's important to switch from using the mixer to using a rubber spatula because you want to ensure that the air you whipped into the mixed thus far doesn't get beaten out at this point. Since the coconut has rough edges and it's heavier than the egg whites, beating it into the mixture will collapse the stiff peaks you've formed. Instead, gently folding it in with a spatula ensures that the mixture doesn't deflate quickly.
