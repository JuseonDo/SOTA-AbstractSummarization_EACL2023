 Allow the broiler to heat up for 5 to 10 minutes.


Most broilers only have an "on" setting, but if yours has separate "high" and "low" settings, set the broiler to high.
 Place the fillets on the interior rack inside the pan with the skin-side facing down, if applicable.


Arrange the fillets in a single layer and space them apart evenly.
If desired, coat the rack with nonstick cooking spray before putting the salmon on it. This is usually unadvised for fatty meats, but not much will drip off the salmon as it cooks. As such, using cooking spray can drastically reduce the amount of salmon that gets stuck to the broiler pan rack.



The salmon is done when you can effortlessly flake the fillets with a fork. The center should be opaque.
You can turn the salmon once during cooking to ensure even browning, but it is not necessary. Moreover, flipping salmon fillets can be difficult to do and may cause the salmon to fall apart in the oven prematurely.
 Broiled salmon can be served hot out of the oven or at room temperature.
