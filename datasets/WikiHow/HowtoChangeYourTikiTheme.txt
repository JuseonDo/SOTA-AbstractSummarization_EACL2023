,, Directly below the search box, you will see the word, "Theme". Look in those boxes and you will see the theme and the basic coloring of the theme.
 If a theme doesn't quite look right, it may not have been updated for your version. The theme page has a list of themes that have been updated...or they just may not work right for you.
 In this instance, the FiveAlive theme is what you are clicking on. When you do, you will see a list of potential themes.
 The one selected here is Candii Clouds. A definite girly theme. Also, note how the screen actually looks (aside from the atrocious pink).


When choosing a theme, consider how it can affect your eyes and perception after long periods of staring at the screen.
 They will vary according to the theme. This particular one is Jqui and Trontastic. Eye-catching to be sure.
 You will want to save it to your computer. The final selection is FluidIndex.

Local System: wherever you put the unpacked files
Remote system: In a Windows TikiWiki, the path is

public_html >> Wiki (or Tiki_root).
 If the theme is constructed correctly, it should be an easy process. If that doesn't work, do the following.
 It will tell you what goes where. Using the FluidIndex example of before:


Find the 'fluidindex' folder that contains the credits.tpl and index.php. Transfer that folder into the styles folder.

public_html/wiki/templates/styles/fluidindex/credits.tpl
public_html/wiki/templates/styles/fluidindex/index.php


Put the *.css file in the Styles folder.

public_html/wiki/styles/fluidindex.css


Copy over the Options folder. Where you find the 'fluidindex.css' file, there is a folder. Copy it into the Styles folder.

public_html/wiki/styles/fluidindex/*.*



,, Under the Themes tab, there is a Theme option. Click on that. Your new theme should be in there.
