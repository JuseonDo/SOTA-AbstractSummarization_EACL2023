 Seasoning the hamburger meat will add flavor and make the burger taste much better. Salt and pepper are the most commonly used seasoning but you may feel free to use whatever else you'd like.;
, The barbecue sauce and onion adds a little extra flavor and the oatmeal seals in the moisture.,, Gather about a handful of meat and roll into a ball shape about the size of a tennis ball.
 The hamburger patty does not have to be perfect but should be flattened so the burger will cook evenly. You can even create a small dent in the center to help the burger keep its shape even as it cooks.


Gas grill - Warm the gas grill to about 450Â°
Charcoal grill - Arrange coals to look like a pyramid, pour lighter fluid on coals, and let the coals sit for about 10 minutes. Then carefully light grill; the grill is ready when coals turn white.
 Use extra precaution since the grill is hot.
 This not only helps to keep the burgers moist and juicy but it also helps lock in the flavor.
 Over-flipping the burgers can cause them to dry out and lose moisture.
 This is another way to keep burgers moist while grilling.
, Add toppings and be creative.
