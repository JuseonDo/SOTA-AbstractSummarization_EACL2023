@article
 It's suggested propping up more 'cutesy' decorations than you usually do, just to help with the prank. Scary decorations are not recommended, especially since you don't want kids to already be frightened.
 Cover it with a black blanket or sheet. Make sure the door is facing outwards, towards the side of the path. Also, check that the crate is hidden, but it is easy to access.
 Wearing face paint or a mask and ripped-up clothing. Make sure your costume will easily convince people that it is real.
 Make sure you are fully concealed.
 Do not jump out at them as they first walk by; otherwise, it will ruin the prank.
 Chase or crawl after them murderously while screaming or growling. They will be horrified at this unexpected event.
