 Learning how to neutralize a fight without injuring the other person is crucial to being a bouncer. Bouncers should be able to handle an altercations in a calm and intentional manner. This makes the bar owner happy and the customers calm.;
, Approach this person about a possible job opening. If he doesn't make hiring decisions, he will know who does and he will likely be consulted during the selection process. Be confident, but not arrogant.
 This will just get you arrested and jobless.
 Not many people do this, but it will work some of the time. But for goodness sake, do not nag them every night when you're drunk. You will never get the job.
 Hang out with them, learn from them and tell them you want to bounce. Sooner or later, you will get to pick up a shift and if it all works out you will get a few more. In this line of work, you have to earn your co-workers' respect. This is the most important thing to remember respect means everything to our kind.
 Get to know the staff and avoid getting intoxicated at the bar. You have an advantage if you are over 25 and have a larger build. Just ask around.
