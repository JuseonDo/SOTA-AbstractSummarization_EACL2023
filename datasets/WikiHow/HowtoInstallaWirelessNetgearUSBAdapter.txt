, SSID is short for service set identifier. SSID is also referred to as a network name because essentially it is a name that identifies a wireless network. Select your own wireless network’s SSID.
 Most wireless routers have several options available when it comes to security. You can typically choose between WEP, WPA-PSK (Personal), or WPA2-PSK. If you can, select WPA2 because it is the most secure form of encryption available for wireless networks. Some older routers don't have this option. Manually enter the Hidden SSID (eg. mywifissid) and select WPA2-PSK as the method of Pre-Shared Key.
, At this time, you have successfully installed the software into your computer.  The USB adapter scans the wireless network and joins the network with SSID and password you just configured. If you see  in the Wireless Assistant panel, you have connected to your wireless network successfully. You will see your SSID, wireless speed (54MBPS), signal strength information as well.
 You can also do this by issuing C:\user\myname>ipconfig /all command under the CMD prompt to verify the USB adapter has successfully joined the wireless network and received the IP address, gateway and DNS IP address from your wireless router. Do this by going into search and typing Command Prompt.
