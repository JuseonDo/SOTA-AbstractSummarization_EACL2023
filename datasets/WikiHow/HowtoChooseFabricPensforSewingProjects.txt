 These pens work well when tracing a design onto a fabric through which the design shows. This type of pen is good for fine fabrics such as organza, fine cotton (lawn), and organdy.;
, These markers have the advantage of fading away a few days after they are used on fabric. The disadvantage is that if you're slow to sew, your lines will disappear.
 These are water soluble and come in either a once use or multiple use version. When using this, make sure that you have reversed the design.


If using an iron-on pencil, keep it sharp for fine lines.
 Before using any fabric marker, check that it is working properly and that it is fresh. It should have a firm tip, not a fuzzy tip. Fuzzy tips will cause the marker to run on the fabric.
