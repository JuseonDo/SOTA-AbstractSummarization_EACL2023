after about 3 weeks at least, if this hasn't kicked in, keep trying and waiting.

 Nook is a shop owner and he always wanted to be from when he was a little boy! There are a few levels to get to the top shop, Nookingtons. Level 1 is Nook's Cranny. That's the little store you got when you first started your Animal Crossing Game. It stocks 2 furniture items each day and very little of the other items. Keep shopping each day and in no time, your store will upgrade to Level 2, Nook 'n' Go! This spin off of the first store is more modern than Nook's Cranny, some 'groovier' music and much more to receive. Level 3 is Nookway and that is the store you are most likely stuck on now if you are reading this. Nookway is the store before Nookingtons, the best, and it surely sticks around a long, long time. Read on to help clear up this problem! Nookingtons has a:


Hair salon - do your hair differently!
An extra level - meet Nook's nephews as they guide you through furniture etc and even the newly added paint - recolor your roof!
New music
Every single tool is sold every day - no waiting daily for your tool to arrive in the store!
Even more!;
, If you have only just recently had your store upgrade to Nookway, there is a good chance you will have to wait.
,,, It shall come eventually.
