 If you want to entertain kids, then this is a key step.;
, For example, if they like jump roping, get a jump rope. Most parents will have a toy or two a child really likes, so ask beforehand.
 You will not only have fun yourself, you'll be watching them. If the children are older, they might want to play by themselves.
 Find appropriate music and start dancing with them. Most kids will love this!

, Make sure the rating is okay with the parent.
 Don't go out if it is dark or cold. Make sure they are dressed properly; frostbite, hypothermia, and heat stroke are huge dangers in kids. Always make sure children drink a lot of water in hot weather.
 Beware of special dietary needs, such as allergies. Don't let them eat something if they are allergic.
 By this time, it's probably close to bedtime. Don't try to get them hyper.
 Always make sure the shows are okay with parents.
 Get them to take a bath, put on their PJs, then have them brush their teeth. This will get them tired and ready for bed.
