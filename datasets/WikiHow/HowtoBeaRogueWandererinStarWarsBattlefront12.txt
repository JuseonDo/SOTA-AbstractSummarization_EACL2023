 The best maps for being a rogue wanderer are Tatooine: dune sea (star wars battlefront 1), Yavin 4: temple(swbf 1 & 2) and Kasshyk (swbf 2), but any stage will work.;
, Drive around shooting and running over people. Get up to top speed and drive up the hill where Tusken camp is. You should go flying into the air and either crash into a tent or land safely and continue farther onto another hill.
 Shoot and run over people and try to ride between the chicken walkers legs. Ride on the bridge near the "Pool" command post.
 Respawn and run over people.
 Try to kill as many people as you can that are on your team. On the death star map, put a jetpack on the control panel for the falling bridge and detonate it when people are on the bridge. Push people into death pits.
