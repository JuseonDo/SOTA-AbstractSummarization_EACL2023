 Not sleep or hibernating, cold boot or from restarting. When you see your computer's manufacturer logo, aka BIOS screen, press the corresponding function key to enter the setup. It usually displays the key to pressing the certain function key to enter setup., Move over to the boot tab by pressing the left or down arrow until you get to the boot tab. Once in the boot section of the BIOS, select Boot priority or boot order or something similar, and when you are in the boot priority, you will see the 4 priorities. The priority should be the floppy, then CD, then HDD group, then networking group or something similar. We are going to change the first priority to HDD group. Go to priority 1 and press enter. A box should pop up displaying the list of hardware to put in the first priority. Select HDD group for the first priority. Go to priority 2 and select CD group, then priority 3 and set it to networking group, and priority 4 select floppy group or you can just disable the fourth priority. Just make sure that the HDD group is in the first priority and that there are no copies of other groups in different priorities. For example, we want to avoid having the HDD group being checked for media that can be booted after anything else. We only want 1 group for 1 priority, Move to the quick boot option and press enter and a box should pop up asking for enable or disable, we want to enable it so move to the enable option and press enter.,
