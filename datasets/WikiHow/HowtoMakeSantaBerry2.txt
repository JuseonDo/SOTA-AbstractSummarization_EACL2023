 Hull them (remove the green stem) by using a knife or a tube huller. To hull with a knife, simply insert the knife on the top of the strawberry and gently press the stem with your thumb. Now move the knife in a circular manner to remove the stem. The removed part will look like a cone with the base containing the stem. Make sure you do not hull too much of the strawberry. After hulling, look for any solid matter inside the strawberry by inserting the knife and checking the tenderness of the strawberry. Remove any solid parts if present inside the strawberry.
 Set aside the tip (hat).
 Place a chunk of pineapple or pound cake on top and secure it with a toothpick to form the face. Trim any excess pineapple. Attach the strawberry tip (hat) on top of the pineapple.
 Beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar together with a mixer in a bowl on high speed until fluffy.
 Use a tip such as #17 or #18.
, Place them onto the Santa to form Santa's eyes. Similarly, apply frosting at the back of the red-hot chocolate chips and place them on Santa to form the mouth of Santa.
