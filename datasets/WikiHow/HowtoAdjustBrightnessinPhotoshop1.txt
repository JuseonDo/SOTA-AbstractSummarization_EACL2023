 Go to the menu located at the top left hand side of the screen and click on "File." Select the "Open" option and select the file of the image you want to work on.;
, Choose "Image" then "Adjustments" and lastly "Brightness and Contrast." Click on this option. A dialogue box will open.
 Moving it to the left makes the picture darker, while sliding it to the right makes the picture brighter. Choose the desired brightness and then proceed to contrast.
 After experimenting with the contrast, determine how much contrast looks best for the picture. Once you have adjusted the contrast, go to the "File" option on the menu bar. Select "Save As" and save your edited picture.
