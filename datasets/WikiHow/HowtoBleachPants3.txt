 Place the pants in a plastic bucket or basin filled with a gallon of warm water and a 1/4 cup of bleach. Stir to soak the pants, then leave to sit for 5 minutes.
 For best results, you should use a warm/hot setting on your washing machine. However, be sure to check the care label on your pants first; if it specifically states that they should be washed in cold water, then use cold water.
 Remove the pants from the bleach solution and add them to your washing machine. If you have any white towels you wish to freshen up with a little bleach, you can add them to the washing machine too.
 Add the regular amount of your usual laundry detergent to the washer, then add about 3/4 cup of bleach.
 Let the washing machine complete a regular cycle, then dry the pants thoroughly in the dryer, or drip dry outdoors.
