 You'll see the option to respond with a text message when you get an incoming call.;
, This looks like a message bubble, and can be found on the right side of the screen, above the Slide to Answer or Accept button.
 There are three premade messages you can choose from. Tap one to decline the call and send the message.


You can change these messages to whatever you'd like. See Changing the Default Message for details.
 This will open the Messages app and allow you to write a custom text message to send the caller.
 You can find this on one of your Home screens, sometimes in a folder labeled "Utilities."

,,,,,, Your new custom messages will replace the original options that appear when you choose to respond with a text. Tapping one will send it immediately.
