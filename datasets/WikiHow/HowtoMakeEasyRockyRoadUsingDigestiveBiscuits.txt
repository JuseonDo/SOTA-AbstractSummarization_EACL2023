 Stir till you get a thick glossy chocolate mix with no lumps. Reserve 60ml of this mixture in a jug and put the jug aside.;
, Leave some larger pieces to add extra crunch.
 Add the marshmallows too. Stir till you get a new thick crunchy mixture.
 It is recommended that you use a small-medium square baking tin.
, Chill for at least 2 hours but preferably overnight, for best results.
 Once taken out of the fridge, cut into equal rectangular pieces.
 Be proud as they compliment you on your rocky roads and remember to save a big slice for yourself!
