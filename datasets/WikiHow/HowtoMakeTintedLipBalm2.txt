, Let the Vaseline soak the water a little.
 This is added to help make your lips smooth.
 Carefully slide it into the bowl without staining anything around you. Start using the fork and stir it until it is a smooth paste.
 Stir it until it is thick and quite smooth. Put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 2 minutes and pour it into a little container. Let it set in a fridge for 6 minutes, to let it cool down.
 Put a cover on it and make sure it is tight so that nothing can get into your lip balm.
 You can now start using your tinted lip balm!
