, For example, choose traditional Indian cuisine balanced by a Pinot Blanc.
 For the Indian example, make cumin bread, or make whichever bread you're having, and set it to rise. Meanwhile have the other two friends make the grocery list.
 Choose your fresh ingredients from the organic section of the store (vegetarian) and the local wine section.
 For an Indian meal, it is suggested that you prepare an eggplant curry, potato curry, and rice salad. Place spices and ingredients in small separate bowls, covered and set aside or refrigerate. When the bread is ready for the second rising, place the wine in the fridge to chill.
 This will fill the house with wonderful aromas that will get your creative juices flowing. Have a few crackers with local vegan pate and a glass of juice as you savour the bread aromas (don't forget to cut off the end of the loaf for a taste after you can't stand the heavenly smell any longer!)

, For an Indian meal a rice salad is perfect. Toast spices to add a wonderful aroma to the house. Refrigerate the salad to allow the flavours to blend.
 Have the music lover in the group choose a selection of music to accompany dinner preparation and to lend atmosphere to the evening.
, This allows time for conversation, music appreciation and savouring of the magnificent aromas of cooking, such as cumin and Garam masala.
 Open the wine and sit down for your fabulous meal. Allow the wine to take the food to a new level as you savour each bite. And savour the entire experience of sharing the joy of slow food with friends!
