 Then bend it underneath itself. This will be the basis for winding the basket, so secure the nozzle snugly.
 Then add twist ties around the perimeter of the initial base to hold everything in place; wind tightly.


Donâ€™t let go of the hose as you secure the wound-up hose reel in place; keep the rest of the hose in the other hand.
Use approximately four twist ties per circular round. Space the ties evenly around the perimeter for the firmest hold.
 Add twist ties around the perimeter of each circle and tie on tightly.
 The base size will depend on personal preference and need; obviously larger baskets require more hose but can also hold a lot more.
 This will begin to build the side of the basket.
 Ensure that the twist ties are aligned and staggered. Continue up the sides of the basket until you consider it to be high enough for your needs.
