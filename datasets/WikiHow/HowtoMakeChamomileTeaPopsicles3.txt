 Pour the water into a small saucepan, then bring it to a boil over medium heat. This will be enough to make about 6 popsicles. Keep in mind, however, that the exact amount will depend on how big or small your popsicle molds are.
, This will allow it to freeze faster. If you are in a hurry, you can place the saucepan into an ice bath, and stir the tea as it cools.


These popsicles are intended for teething babies. If you wish to make the popsicles for yourself, you can sweeten them with some honey. Do not give any popsicles containing honey to children under 1 year of age.
 You will be filling the rest of the space up with strawberry puree to create pretty, two-color popsicles., Rinse the strawberries first, then chop off the stems. Cut them into smaller pieces, then puree them in a blender or food processor until they turn into a chunky liquid.,, Some popsicle molds already have sticks attached to the lid part. Some molds have slots in the lids instead. If your lid has slots in it, pop the lids on first, then insert some popsicle sticks.
 The exact freezing time will vary depending on the size of the popsicle mold. The bigger the popsicle mold is, the longer it will take to freeze.
 To take the popsicles out of the mold, hold the mold under running water for a few moments, then pull the popsicles out. Store the popsicles in a plastic container between sheets of parchment paper. You can also stick them into individual freezer bags. They will last 1 week.
