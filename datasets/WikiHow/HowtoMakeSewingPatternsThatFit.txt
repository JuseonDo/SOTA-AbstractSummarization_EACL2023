 The system is also known as The Golden Rule pattern drafting system. Today the Lutterloh System is the most successful pattern making system for hobby seamstresses worldwide.;
, The system works for women's, men's and children's clothes.
 On this sizing scale there are numbers from 50 to 140.
,
A pin is inserted into the hole corresponding to the number of the bust measurement and then placed in the center of the cross of the pattern design.
 This number stands for centimeters and means that a dot should be placed next to the tape measure at the respected number.
Below the waistline the dots are made with the hip measurement meaning that the pin in the scale needs to be removed from the bust measurement and inserted through the perforated hole in the sizing scale that corresponds to the hip measurement.
 The acrylic tailors curve and the designers curve make perfect lines and curves and are specially designed for all kinds of curves for clothing patterns. A foolproof way of getting the pattern right.

Sewing for yourself doesn't only mean thinking economically but first and foremost being creative. People have always had the desire to be able to make individual fashions that match their own taste in color, style and design.
Choosing and making your own patterns is the ideal way to create your personal style and achieve consistently proper fitting garments.
The Lutterloh System is ideal to make that dream come true.
The teaching kit the Lutterloh System contains 280 different fashions and clothing patterns from a simple bathrobe to elegant evening gowns.
