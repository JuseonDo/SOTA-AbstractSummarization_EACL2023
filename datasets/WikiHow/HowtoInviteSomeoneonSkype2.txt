, The icon looks like an address book and appears at the top of the screen. Once you tap this icon, you’ll be brought to your list of Skype contacts.
 This will bring you to a search box.
 Now Skype will search for a user who matches this information. If nobody is found by phone number, try email address. Cycle through these search strings until your contact is found.
 On the resulting screen, you’ll have the ability to type a unique message to this user. They’ll see this message on their screen when they receive your contact request from Skype.
 The user will appear as “offline” until they accept your contact request. You won’t be able to call or chat with this user until they’ve accepted your request.
 Once you’ve browsed to this menu, fill in the radio button next to “Automatically Add Friends,” then tap OK.

Once these new contacts approve your request, you’ll be communicate with them via Skype.
