Note: Emptying the recycle bin will not completely erase the file from your system. Its still possible to recover the file. Use a file shredder to completely overwrite the file and make sure that no one is able to retrieve it.
If you need to destroy all the information on a computer in an emergency, your best bet is to use Darik's Boot and Nuke. This will wipe a hard drive and over write the data to get rid of all possible ways of recovering data.
