 If you're in the middle of a project, set it for about ten or fifteen minutes every hour. Set a timer so you don't get distracted. When you are done setting the timer, mentally repeat to yourself what time you will be done with your break.;
, It could be to the bathroom, out the door, or to the nearest soda machine. Walking will help you get the energy that you need while allowing you to simply enjoy.
 Sometimes, focusing your brain on something different is enough to get a good break.
 Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can make your nerves jittery. Instead, focus on something that is caffeine free. Limit sugar. If you're hungry, get something to eat.
