 Because there are many types of crescent rolls, consider going for the original flavor. You may be tempted to go for low fat but he low fat kind won’t produce the best tasting cookies. Besides, you are having cookies--live decadently!;
,, Because you will be rolling and baking you’ll want chips that will easily fit inside the crescent rolls.
