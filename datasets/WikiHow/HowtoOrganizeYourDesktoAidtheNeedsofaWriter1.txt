, Toss anything you don't need. If you need to keep papers, purchase a cheap file cabinet or box, and file them there. If the desk surface is large enough, frequently-used paper may go in baskets, binders, or racks on top.
 A trash can is the ideal spot. A few objects that are meaningful or inspirational could occupy the back corners or hang on a nearby wall, but don't trade work area for trinkets.
,,, This can help to corral paper clips and other small items and still keep them handy. If your desk has drawers, though, take a good look at what's in them. If you don't need it for your work (pennies, loose screws, last year's birthday card), toss it!

,, This is essential for writing at night. Consider getting a desk blotter. It will protect the desk from ink and offer a clean surface on which to write. Many desk blotters are printed with calendars, too, if you wish to track your schedule or progress.
