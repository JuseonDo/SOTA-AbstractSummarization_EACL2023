,, If not, take your time to decide what alternative video game you will entertain yourself with. After all, you have nothing to lose.
 Keep in mind that if you don't calm yourself, you will get distracted. Even if your motive is to win, you must stay focused to reach your goals. Getting angry or upset is one of the most vulnerable ways of distracting yourself from your activities, and you will end up losing.
