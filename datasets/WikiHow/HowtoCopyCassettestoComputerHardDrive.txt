 It can be RCA cables, or even a headphone jack, like on a Walkman.;
, If it's a small hole, like a headphone jack, it will be 3.5mm (1/8 inches). If there are two jacks, with red and white around them, they're RCA jacks.
 Be sure to specify that you want a stereo cable. It will need to have the red and white (Right / Left) RCA plugs on one end and the 1/8" plug to go into your Line-In connection on your PC. The way to be sure it's a stereo cable: There will be two little grooves running around the plug-in part of the plug. If there's only one, it's a mono cable and will not transfer your recording in stereo.
 The standard Microsoft "Sound Recorder" won't work very well. Try Audacity which is free, and easy to use.
, Too soft? Adjust the volume of the Line Input on the computer until it's just right. It should just hit the top (just where it begins to turn red) where the song is loudest, but it shouldn't be going over all the time.
 If your cassette player automatically plays the other side of the tape, you can leave the computer to its own devices for a while. If not, flip the tape over, and record that side.
