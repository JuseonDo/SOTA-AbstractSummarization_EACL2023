 They will be more likely to look for an upgrade for you in hopes that you enjoy your celebration and tell others about their great service.;
, This will give you a better chance at many hotels of finding a free upgrade.
 Booking direct saves the hotel money in commissions. You may be more likely to get a hotel room upgrade if the hotel saved the money on reservation fees.
 Some hotels will upgrade based on a waiting list so that their other less expensive rooms are open for walk-in customers.



Frequent the same hotels if you enjoy them.
Make sure the staff and management of the hotel realizes you are a frequent stayer by being friendly and letting them know you’ve been there before or you’ll be back again.
