If Zango advertisements have been bothering you, you might have already deduced that Zango is installed. Open up your web browser and check for a toolbar with the Zango logo on the right side if you are unsure if your computer has Zango on the hard drive.;

The removal process gets slower when there are many programs working simultaneously on the hard drive. You can restart your computer prior to removing anything to make sure any programs running in the background end.

You might be asked to choose whether you'd like to uninstall the toolbar or the search assistant. To fully uninstall Zango, you must choose to remove both.



This step ensures that the uninstall was successful.



Plenty of virus and adware removal software can be found online for free, but there are also a number of reputable websites that provide the same service for a small fee.







This step will ensure that Zango has been removed completely. Even after you've removed the program from the "Add/Remove Programs" folder, there might still be hidden Zango files to remove.







If you still notice Zango advertisements, you might need to bring your computer into a professional computer technician.
