,, Keep on following the trail until you see an odd tree in the way.

You don't have to capture the Sudowoodo. Just make sure that you somehow manage to make it go away.
There is only one Sudowoodo in the game unless you trade with someone, so that's basically the only time you get to see one. Be sure to save before battling it, so you can restart if you fail by being defeated or by defeating it (if you wanted to catch it).
Sudowoodo is a Rock type, not a Grass type (even though it looks like a tree).
 He will then give you the Rock Smash TM.
