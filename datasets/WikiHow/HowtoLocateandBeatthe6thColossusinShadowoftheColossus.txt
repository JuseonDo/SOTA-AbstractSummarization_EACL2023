 Stand next to Agro and press ∆ in order to mount her.;
, Start looking around for where the light centralizes.
 You will see a dense green forest. Go through the path that leads into the forest.
 Head right as soon as you see the end of the forest and a pool of water below.


Continue until you see a path that leads outside the forest.
 You'll see that the area will begin to change from a mud to sand; this means you're on the right track.
 It will centralize toward the southwest.
 Go inside the crevice and dismount Agro.
 Turn right at the end of the stairs and you'll see another set of blocks. Climb through these too.
 At the end of it, a cut scene will play. Now make your way down to the ground below.


Do NOT jump! Wander will die from this height.
 Wander will automatically grab onto the ledge. Release R1 and press it again in order to fall down to the next ledge.
 A short cut scene will play showing the sixth colossus being released from its confinement.
 Go towards the opposite side of the wall you climbed down on.
 Once you're on the pillar, jump on top of the wall and fall down on the next area.


Be fast while doing this; Barba might attack you while you're on the wall.
, Barba can't touch you while you're under it.
 When Barba tries to peek at you, his beard will touch the ground.
 He'll shake for a while, so hold on a bit.
 Then make your way to the top of its head for the first weak point.
 This should be enough to make the weak point disappear.


Be careful since Barba is an extremely violent shaker, so don't let go of its hair until it stops shaking.
 Go to the left side for the second weak point.
