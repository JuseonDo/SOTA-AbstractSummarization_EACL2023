@summary
drive teeth can get terribly misaligned because of worn gear teeth.

@summary
with your blu-ray drive open, remove the platform that holds the rollers.

@summary
twist the white gear denoted with the yellow clockwise sign until the the gear separates from the black platform on the left side of the drive.

@summary
realign the black platform and twist the white gear counterclockwise until the two catches are fully raised.

@summary
pull the rollers outwards as the pink arrows indicate and screw the roller platform back onto the drive.

@summary
insert a junk cd along the top half of the drive as though the drive were accepting it.

@summary
while holding the cd in its loaded position, pop the top half of the blu-ray drive onto the bottom half.

@summary
screw everything back together, boot up your ps3, and eject your cd.

 You may find it easier to reassemble the drive in the loaded position.;
, The only one screw is circled in red. Be careful not to touch the plastic bumpers circled in blue. In the event that you do, consult the "Tips" section of this article.
 Practically every gear in this area moves every other gear, but the white one seems the easiest to twist. Keep twisting until the two catches circled in green are completely lowered.
 These catches keep you from inserting a second disc. You should not have to twist the white gear fully counterclockwise and it is a good idea not to. Make sure the left black platform is not tight against anything - especially the stuff towards the bottom edge.



When this is done, your rollers should be slightly loose. Work with the rollers and the white gear until they are just tight enough to loosely hold a CD as though the drive were reading it.
 Pay attention to how the junk CD locks into place as though you still cared about it.



You can shake it lightly, but if it doesn't come together smoothly, something might be misaligned. Go back and tweak until it comes together with relative ease. Don't forget the white magnet.
 It should come out smoothly and be re-accepted smoothly.
