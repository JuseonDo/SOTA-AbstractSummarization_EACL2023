@summary
the number of tiles each player takes is determined by the number of people playing the game.

@summary
once everyone has counted out his or her tiles, say, "split!",

@summary
arrange your tiles into an interlocking crossword.

@summary
once you have finished making words with all of your tiles, yell "peel!",

@summary
work in the new tiles.

@summary
continue playing in this manner until all the tiles in the bunch have been used or the number of tiles left is fewer than the amount of players.

@summary
flip the tiles over, mix them up in the center of the group, draw new tiles and play again, and again, and again...

,, For 2-4 players, draw 21 tiles each. For 5-6 people, draw 15 tiles each. For 7-8 people, draw 11 tiles each. Group the leftover tiles into a middle pile or "bunch".
 This is the signal for everyone to flip over his or her tiles., Tiles may connect vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. The goal is to create complete words out of all your tiles.


Note: If you have a tile you do not wish to use, not enough vowels, too many consonants, etc., try "dumping". Place the single tile you are dumping back in the bunch, exclaim, "Dump!", and draw out three new tiles.
 (It's always a good idea to double-check first to make sure all your words are valid and spelled correctly.) Everyone must draw one new tile from the bunch.
 Tiles can be moved, rearranged, rotated, etc. In this example, the player has a newly drawn T. By replacing the D in FOOD with the T and creating FOOT, the player was able to place the D at the end of TIE to make TIED, effectively using all of his or her tiles.
 At this point the player with a finished crossword, proclaims "Bananas!" He or she is the winner!
