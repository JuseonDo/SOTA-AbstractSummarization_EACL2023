 You may also choose to do this without worrying about how time-consuming it may be. Keep in mind that may find it virtually impossible to find a 'newly-released' album in a thrift store, but even if you do, go figure.
 Is there anything that appeals to you? If there is, take a good look at it. What's the condition that it's in? Is it rare? And does the price reflect these factors? If you feel that you may want to buy it. Look at it closer. You may not be allowed to do this in some stores but look inside the CD case. It's not impossible for people to open up the cases of used CD's in a thrift store only to see that's it's empty or that it's got the wrong CD in it. This is a result of people wanting to clear their houses of junk and take anything to thrift stores without taking time to think or inspect.
 Purchase it. With thrift stores you may find that it's here today and gone the next, so be wise about your decision, especially if it's a rare CD that you've always wanted.
