@summary
survey the land for signs of dried out river beds.

@summary
dig a few curved holes (the more the better) about 19 inches (50 cm) deep so that the moist subsoil is clearly visible.

@summary
throw any plants into the hole/holes.

@summary
,

@summary
place an open coffee can, mug, cup or canteen in the center of each hole.

@summary
lay a taut piece of clear plastic wrap across the top of each hole.

@summary
,

@summary
create a seal by pouring sand in a circle around each hole along the outside of the plastic wrap.

@summary
place a small to medium sized rock in the center of the plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap dips to a point above the can.

@summary
wait for the sun to evaporate water out of the moist soil and any plants within each hole.

@summary
once the sun dries the subsoil in a hole, just dig another.

 These locations are the best place to seek moisture.;

If you are in dryer conditions, the moist subsoil may be slightly deeper. Dig until you find it.
Do not dig the hole/holes in the shade. This process needs direct sunlight to work correctly. Look around and make sure that shade won't move over your solar still before evening arrives.

If you have a length of plastic tubing, you can run it from the bottom of the coffee can out the edge of the hole. You can use the tubing to suck the water from the can without dismantling the still.

Pour the sand 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the edge of the plastic wrap. Ensure that there are no gaps. The plastic wrap must seal the hole shut; if it is punctured, the water will not condense.
 Keep the plastic wrap from touching the can or else the water will not drip into the can.
 The water will condense on the plastic wrap because it cannot escape the hole and will drip into the can. If you have installed plastic tubing, drink from that.
 Alternatively, you may dig deeper using the established hole/holes.
