 Use a fresh clean scented body wash and not anything too musky or overpowering. Make sure to wash your hair thoroughly and use a lightweight shampoo that best suits your hair type. Condition 3-4 times a week so your hair does not get oily. Afterwards, brush your hair with a wide tooth comb so you don't split your hair. Avoid using a lot of products in your hair. It can make your hair look greasy and even oily.;
, Make sure it's right for your skin type and that you're not allergic to anything in it.
 Avoid anything scented because it usually irritates the skin. Use a facial moisturizer for your face. I stress this so much because body lotion is so much greasier than facial lotion. Facial lotion could prevent breakouts and oily skin better than body lotion.
 Brush your teeth twice every day with a minty fresh toothpaste. Painting your nails is another way to express yourself! Think outside the box when you choose your color! Hair should either be tied up and hanging with bangs,or you can leave it open with layers. For a preppy clean look use a bow to tie your hair. It also gives any outfit a clean finish.
 Bare Minerals or any other mineral cover up is perfect for a fresh faced look, but don't cover your whole face, only the parts where you have any blemishes or dark circles. A little brown eyeliner and light mascara is enough makeup. If you must use a little blush on the cheeks, it is up to you.
 Colors are usually pastel and light. Jeans and a pretty top with cute ballet flats are perfect for a clean look.
 Only use a little perfume,otherwise it's overpowering for school.
