 They can penalize you for not addressing them as Chairman, not saying thank you when you receive a card, talking, etc. However they must do the same things for each person.
 If a person wants to call time-out, they must put their hands in the form of a T, signifying that everyone must put their cards down. If anyone touches their cards before the person who called the time-out says, "Time-In," then that person or person(s) get a penalty for touching their cards during a time-out.
 If they do, they will get a penalty for talking. Only during point of order(S)and you MUST end the point of order.
 Penalties can be repeated.
, If two eights are played on top of each other you must slap the deck. When a queen is played, bow your head. When a king is played say "All hail the great chairman of mau."
