 Be yourself and that way you can see if that person's right for you and vice versa.;
,, If you can't have fun with them, don't hang out with them!

, Don't have B.O. - shower daily and carry anti-perspirant deodorant all of the time. Brush teeth really well with whitening toothpaste and floss to get rid of the in between gunk. Use mouthwash if you get bad breath.
 This is a good way to get you noticed and gives you a chance to express yourself to them.
 Out of all the things in the world to talk about I'm sure you can say something.
 Nothing is wrong with having a good time, even if it's just a YouTube video you saw, a funny story, you can also say something random that has nothing to do with what anyone was talking about.
 Not like just saying "Nice shirt", compliment them after they do something awesome instead of liking their shoes that they wore yesterday, if their hair actually does look so amazing that you have to then go ahead and tell them that.
