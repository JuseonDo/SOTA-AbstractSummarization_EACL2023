 Heat the water over medium-high heat.
 Cover the pot and allow the wedges to boil for 10 minutes before removing them. Pat the sweet potatoes dry with a clean towel or paper towels.
 Leave only 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of empty space in between the surface of the oil and the rim of the fryer. Heat the oil to a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit (148.9 degrees Celsius).
 Fry the wedges for 3 to 4 minutes or until they just begin to brown.
 Set the sweet potato fries on several layers of paper towel. The paper towel absorbs some of the oil, helping the fries drain. Allow the wedges to cool for at least 10 minutes, but do not keep them for more than 2 hours.
 Only fry a handful of sweet potato wedges at one time.
 By this point, the fries should have cooled off significantly and need to be re-fried to heat. Even if the sweet potato fries have not cooled completely, you should still re-fry them to finish cooking them.
 Cook the fries in the oil for an addition minute until they puff up. Continue re-frying handfuls of sweet potato wedges until you have finished the entire batch.
 Drain them on dry paper towels for one minute.
 Toss the seasonings together to thoroughly combine them.
 Gently toss the fries or shift the bowl around until the fries are thoroughly coated.
 Serve the sweet potato fries as a side dish or snack.
