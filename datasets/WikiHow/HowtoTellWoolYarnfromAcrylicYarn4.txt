 The color of the yarn does not matter. The bleach will dissolve real wool, and it won't do anything to acrylic., Make sure that your jar has a lid, as you will need to seal it in order for this to work.
 The bleach should completely cover the yarn. If you are using a larger jar, you may need more bleach. Keep adding bleach until it covers and soaks the yarn.
 You may notice a slight fizzing after a few minutes. Don't worry. This is normal, and an indicator that the yarn is made of wool, or another natural fiber.
 If the yarn has disappeared, it was made from wool. If the yarn is still there, take a closer look. A 100% acrylic yarn will be mostly unchanged, although it may have faded a little. Yarn made from an acrylic-wool blend will appear somewhat damaged. It may be faded, ragged, or thinner than when you first put it in.
