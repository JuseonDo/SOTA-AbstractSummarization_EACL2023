 Make sure you thoroughly mix it as the end result may taste a bit off if you don't.;
, It may take a while to mix it. Make sure you mix gently to avoid powder flying out of the mug.
,, It's very important that you mix thoroughly because if the egg is not completely combined, the muffin will taste gross and eggy.
 Check the mug after cooking and decide whether you should put it back in the microwave or not. Not every microwave cooks the same way.
 You can either eat it in the cup or tip it out in a bowl or on a plate. The muffin will not keep so don't store it away.
