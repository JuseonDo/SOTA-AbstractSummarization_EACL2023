 There are many herbal tea selections to try.



Relaxing - if you are trying to get some rest, look for a tea with chamomile as the main ingredient.

Uplifting - lavender, thyme, and spearmint are also good things to look for in a blend.

Soothing - if you are trying to soothe a cold you'll want something with eucalyptus, ginger, cinnamon, and/or licorice root.;
, The least you should ever heat up in a kettle is two cups. Any less then that, and you run the risk of boiling your kettle boil dry. Put the kettle on the stove (or plug in the electric kettle) and bring the water to boiling.
 Put lids on each to keep in the heat. By heating up the cups and pot, your tea will keep warmer longer, and you lessen the risk of having a teacup or top shatter.
 When the water has come to a rolling boil, empty the teapot of warm water and add the herbal tea leaves/flowers or tea bags. The general rule when making a pot of tea is to add a teaspoon of leaves (or a tea bag) for each cup and one for the pot. If only making tea for one in a cup or mug, then add the bag or leaves to the mug and pour the boiling water over them.
 While steeping too long can bring out the bitter tannins in black, green, or white teas, herbal teas are different. They generally don't have many tannins and therefore can be steeped anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. Use extra tea leaves to make a stronger tea;not a longer steeping time.
, Sugar or honey may be used to taste. However, some herbal teas are naturally sweet. One should taste each tea by itself first before deciding if milk and honey are needed.
