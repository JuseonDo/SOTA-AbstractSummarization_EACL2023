 If it's a tycoon, be sure to make it work, and make enough tycoons. If it's an obby, be sure not to use too many colors. Only use tints of blue, green and brown. Red will make players mad when they can't win. Blue and green keeps them calm. If it's a minigame kind of game, make sure it works, and that you don't have to wait too long. If it's a disaster game, make sure the disasters are hard enough, and they don't have to wait too long for every disaster. If it's another kind of game, make something to do. A lot of hangout places on Roblox don't have any activities to do there.
 Users will try to get a badge that's worth it. A 'You Played' badge is okay too. It advertises your own game on other people's profile.


Some ideas for badges include:

, It will make your game more original and unique.
