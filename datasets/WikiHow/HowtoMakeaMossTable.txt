, Having different types of moss will allow you to create a variety of colors.
 Measure the pieces to fit under the glass-top area of the table â€“ one base piece and four sides measuring the same length as the table. Making the sides deeper is better, to create a feeling of depth. Form the base from the plywood for the moss to be assembled on and attached under the coffee table.


Measure twice, cut once.
 Use L wood brackets and some very small screws to keep the holding base in place.


You can purchase thin pieces of wood veneer to include in the design.
 Choose to put different colors alongside each other, to vary the appearance of the moss, and include such additions as pieces of driftwood or branches, to create visual breaks and interesting effects.


Use a good pair of scissors to cut moss into the shapes desired.
 Doing this will help to create a raised effect. This can be done here and there or all the way across, depending on the design you're aiming for.
 The sand can be placed in gaps, to add more visual appeal and a color variant. It can also help bring forth the landscape effect.



Make adjustments as you go until you're happy with the design.



Note the side table; this is how the cocktail table looked initially.
 Now you have a beautiful moss table.
