 The willow branches should be small, and the same size or less as a pencil. Young branches have the most indolebutyric acid in them, the hormone that encourages rooting.You'll need 2 cups of the small branches.


Alternatively, use the bark from older willow trees. In this case, you will need 3 cups because the hormone amount is much less in older trees. Bark from either the trunk or branches is fine.
Avoid using branches found on the ground because they are dead and the hormone will no longer be active.
 If using branches, cut into pieces about 3 to 6 inches (7.5cm to 15cm) in length. If using bark, cut into pieces about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10cm).
 Add the clippings.
, Set aside to brew. Leave for at least 12 hours, preferably 24 hours.
 Remove all willow clippings. Put the lids on, label and date the bottles. The rooting hormone tonic is now ready for use. Store in the refrigerator for up to two months.
 To use it, pour some tonic into a small container that will hold the cuttings comfortably. Add the cuttings to the container, wounded end facing into the solution. Leave for a few hours to let the tonic work its magic. The cuttings are then ready to plant in the appropriate medium (see below for help).
