, Clean up any debris, manure, or other unsightly items. Also, check for any unsafe things, like nails or broken glass, that the horses could step on., Unless you are equipped with professional photography lights, natural lighting is the best. Early morning or late evening light is the most flattering, but check that there is enough light to take a picture without the flash.



  Watching the world go by.
, If you want to bathe it, do it the day before, so that the natural oils in the coat will return to give the horse a healthy sheen.,,,, Spray both with a detangler so as to avoid clumped hair in your final shot.,,), take a lunge whip and pop it on the ground to get the horses moving. Pop it as many times as needed to get the horse at the pace you need. It helps to have one or two helpers doing this so that you can get a still shot., Have a helper hold a carrot or other treat just out of the camera shot to position the horse's head and make him prick his ears., Many cameras have a portrait setting that is perfect for posed shots, and some also have an action setting that works nicely for action shots., For a portrait, this is not quite as essential, but for a motion shot, try to catch the horse when he is airborne, with legs fully extended, or with legs fully contracted. Mid-stride shots are usually not very attractive., Shoot at different angles and sides, and shoot a lot. When the shoot is over, you will have many more photos to choose from when picking out the best ones.
 Experiment with different styles. Make it your own.
