if you're 25, there are agencies who will still consider you for high-fashion depending on how well you've aged, so make sure to take excellent care of your skin, invest in a good eye cream and moisturizer, and stay out of the sun!,

@summary
if you're over 25 and believe you still look young enough to try it, submit your photos to reputable agencies through their websites or snail-mail.

@summary
be honest with yourself.

@summary
if you're over 25 and have ruled out a career in high fashion, or an agent advised you to go commercial, by all means, listen to him/her and go commercial!

 That means, no tanning! EVER. Unless of course it's sunless, in which case, don't overdo it, and don't look orange. Ask a family member or friend who you think would be bold enough to tell you if you look orange or not. If you do, tone it down or avoid it all together. Photographers will apply bronzer to your skin if they think it's too pale.
 Agencies usually cut off open calls to models over the age of 25. Take 4 photos of yourself. The first should be a photo of the front of your face with NO MAKEUP on (if you insist on wearing it, however, make sure you keep it down to mascara and concealer that matches your skin tone perfectly. Second, a photo of your profile. Third, a full body shot of you in a bikini (NEVER send nude photos. They are UNACCEPTABLE). And finally, a full body shot of you in a bikini from the side.
 Are you a size 4, 6, or 8? Are you over 5'9"? If not, you should probably go with commercial/print/plus-size modeling. Seek out agencies with these divisions.
 You can have tremendous success as a commercial/print model, and best of all, unlike those of us in high fashion, you never expire. You can model until you die. Plus, it's still super glam, super fun, and you have the opportunity to make lots of money.
