Make sure your parents sign the permission slip. In some cases, if you have different teachers for different classes, you may need them to sign the permission slip, and promise to make up any missed homework. Make sure your parents pay the amount of money needed for the trip or you might show up with your suitcase and they tell you you're not eligible to go!;
, Most electronics are pre-installed with a weather application. Or check out The Weather Channel's website or Weatherbug.com to find the forecast.
 Don't forget hygiene supplies!

, This is best used for phone calls, souvenirs, and toiletries.
 Some schools won't allow you to bring these things, so check with your teacher if you can take one with you.
 Set your alarm for 2 hours before you need to arrive at the school or meeting place so that you have time to eat breakfast, take a shower and pack anything you forgot!

, Also, pack a lot of snacks for the trip! Packing too much is better than not packing enough, as you can share your overpacked snacks with your friends.
 Unless the seats are already assigned, ask your friend to save you a seat. You wouldn't want to sit with someone you don't like, or a teacher.
