 Some steps you can do these with are: dégagé, relevé, élevé and frappés. 8-8-4-4-2-2-1-1-1-1 means that you do eight on your right foot, then eight on your left foot and so on, or for relevé/élevé, you just do it twice.
 A good one is relevé sixteen times, then rélevé sixteen times. Relevé in coupe derrière right foot eight times, then rélevé in coupe derrière eight times. Repeat for left foot.
,,, It could be a grand jete, a grand jete in arabesques, a tour jete, anything.
;
, With your toes try to move them from one place to another. You can arrange them by color or size. This exercise will train your feet while you play. The flexing and releasing of the toes and feet will develop their muscles and flexibility. You can even practice this exercise at home, while standing or sitting in a chair.
, Try to stretch the top of the foot like the ankle. Do not attempt to stretch the toes.
 On the way back – First flex the toes, then the ankle. Repeat at least 10 times each.
 Repeatedly stretch and flex just the toes. Repeat 10 times /1- stretched pointes, 2 – flexed pointes/
