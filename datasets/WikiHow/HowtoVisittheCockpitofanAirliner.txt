 If a member of the cabin crew or cockpit crew notices that you would like to visit the cockpit and invites you over, then hooray! If not, continue reading.
 Try to be one of the last to disembark. As you leave the jet, ask a member of the cockpit crew to see the cockpit. Given how busy the cockpit crew are before a flight, you're far more likely to be accepted after landing.
 If you do manage to be allowed into the cockpit, have a chat with the pilots and ask to take pictures/videos, to retain this memory.
