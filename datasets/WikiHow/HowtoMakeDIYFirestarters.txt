 About 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6Â cm). Your going to put them in the cup in the shape of a U. This way the ends of the wick stick out of the cup. You can put in one piece of twine, or a second if you want.;
,, The easiest way is to take pieces of wax and put them in a can (like a soup can) and put that on a hot plate. If you don't have a hot plate you can always get a large candle (not a long tapered candle!) and light it. As it burns a pool of melted wax will form under the candle wick. This can be used as well.
 If there is still room in your cup, you can add more woodchips and wax till it is filled to the top if you would like.
