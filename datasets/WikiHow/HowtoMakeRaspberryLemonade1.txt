 Combine 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water in a saucepan. Cook it over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally. Set side and let cool.;
, Keep pureeing the raspberries until you get a smooth mixture. Don't worry about the seeds yet.
 Press the back of a spoon against the sieve to get as much pulp out as possible. When you are done, discard the seeds.


If you don't mind the seeds, then you can simply pour the raspberry puree into the pitcher, and omit the sieve.
 Make sure that the simple syrup has completely cooled before you add it in.
 How much water you add will depend on how sweet or tart you want your lemonade to be. Start with 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water, give it a taste, then add more if needed., Fill some tall glasses with ice cubes, and carefully pour the lemonade into each one. Garnish with lemon slices, raspberries, and/or mint leaves.
