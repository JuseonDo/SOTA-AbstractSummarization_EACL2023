@summary
purchase some wood that will give you the right look for your space.

@summary
store the wood in the space you will be installing at least 2 weeks prior to actually starting the install.

@summary
remove the old floor down to the sub-floor.

@summary
start by snapping a chalk line across your sub floor.

@summary
begin with the longest, most straight wall; using the longest, most straight floor boards you have.

@summary
(option 1) face nail (using finish nails) then angle nail the first few rows of boards you install.

@summary
racking the boards gives the chance to eliminate imperfect pieces and helps stagger board ends.

@summary
when there is enough space to begin using the floor nail gun, space nails 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) apart (2-5 nails per board).

@summary
check your work as you continue, use a square if you have a good reference point.

@summary
use a jamb saw to undercut trim pieces.

 Due to the large amount of different types of hardwood, choose one that fits your budget and appearance. Also be prepared for delivery of a very heavy large stack of wood if you are doing more than one room.;
, This give the wood a chance to expand and contract based on the humidity and temperature of the space. The amount of time that the wood needs to acclimate will vary from region to region; if you live in a dry region and the wood was properly stored at the warehouse, it may only take a couple of days.
 This will prevent having different "levels" of flooring across the space where you will be installing. Remove as many nails, tacks, etc. as possible for best results.
 Measure out from the wall the distance of one floor board plus 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) expansion room. You can use a scrap piece of lauan or other thin wood material against the wall to use as a spacer. (see image)

, It is very important that the first few floor boards you lay down are perfectly straight across the room, this prevents your floor from looking crooked or slanted across the room.
 (Option 2) Face nail (using electric brand nail gun or finish nail gun) the first few rows of boards you install. This will keep your very first rows straight where wall prevents the use of the floor nail gun.
 Lay out the boards in a few rows and randomly stagger boards by shade, while staggering the board ends by 4-6" or more between adjacent rows. Boards with defects and large knots can be used in less conspicuous areas along the wall.
 Try not to nail boards less than 2" from either end.
 Make sure each board end is at least 4-6" from the board ends in the previous row. Continue using the floor nail gun until you reach the far wall, then face nail the last remaining rows.
