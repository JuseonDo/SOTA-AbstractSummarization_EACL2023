 You may even need to water it twice a day during hot, sunny weather. Do not let the soil stay dry for any extended amount of time.
 This is only optional, however.
 Cut the greens off at the soil using scissors until only one seedling remains in each hole.


Pulling the seedling out is not recommended. Uprooting can disrupt the medium and damage the roots of the remaining plants.
 Roots will not form correctly if the stems are bent.
 When carrot roots are exposed to sunlight, they begin to green, making them inedible.
 Carrots are prone to develop mildew when kept too wet, and you may need to spray your crop if you receive heavy rains over an extensive period of time.
 Grasp the greens near the top of the root and gently wiggle them out of place. The earlier you harvest, the sweeter the carrots will be.
