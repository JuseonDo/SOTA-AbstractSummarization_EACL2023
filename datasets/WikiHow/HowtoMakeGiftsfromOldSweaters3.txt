 Put the sweaters in the washing machine at a high temperature, with soap. Dry them on high heat, and you have your felted sweaters., This will give you large pieces of raw material from which to choose your design., For example, you may want to use part of a body pillow or a floor pillow for a large pet. You can probably use a normal head pillow for a cat or small dog., You may need to tape a few pieces of paper together to get the entire measurement of the pillow. Cut the paper to the exact size of 1 half of the pillow, fitting it to the curves of the sides., For an interesting look, experiment with making your squares different sizes and shapes - small, thin, thick, rectangular and square., Cut out any excess material that goes over the paper piece., Place the side you want to show in toward the center and pin, so that you are stitching on the side that will not show. You will want to leave approximately a 1/8-inch (0.3 cm) seam on each piece., You will need to go back to your pattern and continue pinning and sewing new rows, until your patchwork pet bed is completely sewn together. You may want to do it 1 square at a time, to ensure you follow your pattern.,, You may want to do stripes or do a simple 1 or 2 color combination across the back, because it will show less than the front side., Pin through both layers at about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the edges. Sew up your rectangle at 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) from the edges, back stitching at the corners., Slip the pillow into the patchwork case., You can also affix a zipper to either edge of the last open side for easy washing.
