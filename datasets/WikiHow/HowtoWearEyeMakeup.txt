 If you use a cream blush though, some people prefer adding that as a last step.;
, You can use a not-too-bright cream eyeshadow or concealer for this instead of a "real" eye primer.
 Gather 3 shades of the same color (ex. light beige, gold, dark brown).
,, Voila!

, Blend the eyeliner into your upper lashline; it should be thickest right between the middle and the outer corner of your eyelid. You can also wing out your liquid liner. For eye lining on your lower lid, rub it onto your waterline. Keep it light, though.
, First, have the right shade. If your complexion is light, opt for a dark brown/brown-black. Otherwise, black should be fine. Set your wand at the base of your eyelashes and wiggle it all the way up. Repeat until all your lashes are coated. Dip the wand in the tube, and repeat a second, third.. time. Then, do the same to your other eye. If you want to mascara your lower lashes, wipe off the tip of the wand, then touch them lightly with the tip.
 Do this if the mascara clumped (optional).
