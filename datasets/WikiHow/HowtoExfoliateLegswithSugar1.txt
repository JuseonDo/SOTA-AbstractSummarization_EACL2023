 Do not go out into the sun after using the scrub; it is best to use this at night., While bad for your health, sugar is great for your skin. It will help exfoliate away dead skin cells and reveal the soft, supple skin underneath.
 This will soften your skin, and make the simple scrub more effective. If you'd like, you can even start your usual bathing or showering routine.
 Start from the top of your leg, and work your way gradually toward the bottom.
 If you'd like, you can wash your legs with some soap and water to get rid of any sticky residue. You can also shave your legs at this point. Many people find that shaving just after exfoliating leaves their skin silky-smooth.
 While great at toning and exfoliating, this mixture can be a little drying, so make sure that you apply some moisturizer after you get out of the shower. If you tend to have very dry skin, consider applying the moisturizer while your skin is still damp; this will help seal in the moisture better.
