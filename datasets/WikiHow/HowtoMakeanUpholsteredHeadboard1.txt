 You can make a headboard out of almost anything, and in any size. However since it will soon be covered with fabric simple plywood should be fine—no need for expensive hardwoods when no one will see them. Read more about building your own headboard.;
, Beds vary in width from full to king, so measure your bed so you can size your headboard appropriately. Use a circular saw for best results.
 You can use two or three, or a dozen, depending on the pattern you want. For the best look place them evenly and symmetrically on the head board.
 The holes shouldn't be very thick—just large enough to easily thread a needle through several times.


For each button, you can drill 1 hole or 2 holes close together, depending on which method of tufting you wish to use. For two holes, try to match the holes in the buttons you plan to use.
