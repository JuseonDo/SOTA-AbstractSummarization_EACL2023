, It's dating. It's meeting people and socializing and spending time in the company of others who may or may not be the perfect person. Everyone has something to offer. Finding 'friends' if only that is a victory in itself.
 Remind yourself that people are happy to spend time with you, and that you have a lot to offer.
 Focus outward. Make a generous gesture to someone everyday and notice how good you feel. Sometimes just a simple compliment is a gift to people.
 Take it easy. Meeting people and sizing them up can be stressful, but be as stress-free as you can about it.
 Give them room to breathe. Don't bombard them with telephone calls, surprise visits, and dates every day of the week.
 Be open with people. At the right moment, if they look good, tell them. If they are funny, let them know. Definitely say something to give dates feedback.
 An ex should never be allowed to linger around your new relationship.
