 This is the most obvious sign. However, do not assume someone is talking about you just from body language, such as staring, giggling, whispering when you're not around, and/or cutting off a conversation when you approach. Even though this can be a sign, it doesn't necessarily mean it. For example, if a group of people stop talking when you approach, but continue when you leave, they might be talking about something they don't want anybody to hear, not just you.;
, Don't just confront them automatically; it will make the situation worse, and if they weren't talking about you at first, after a confrontation, they certainly will. Find out if they are suddenly asking more personal questions behind your back.
 If they used to be your friend, they are now isolating themselves away from you.
 It is ok to ask friends for advice, but don't be upset with them if it doesn't go your way. Don't ever hurt the person you "think" might be talking about you because chances are they're not. Be careful of who you confide in and where you confide.
 It's happened to many before, and it hurts. Either build the relationship, or cut it off, depending on how serious it is.
 Who were they talking to? Why did they say it? What did they say? What did they mean by it? How much does it hurt? Who is the person who said it? Can I build back my relationship with them? Should I confront them (only to be done IF you know the person well , if you're certain they're talking about you, and if you're sure it won't make you look bad).
