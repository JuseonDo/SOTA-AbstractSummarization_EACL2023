, Drill a hole in the center of the rose with an electric drill and bit. The electrician can tell you how big the hole in the center must be.
 Use a 120-grit sandpaper pad and hand sander. The sanding process will scuff the ceiling so that it adheres more fully to the surface of the ceiling.


Always wear a ventilation mask when sanding.
 Set up your ladder. Have someone hold the ceiling rose in the position you desire, and then outline the area with a pencil.


Remove the rose, so that you can apply the glue.
You may need to set up two ladders so that both the person holding and the person outlining can access the ceiling rose.
 You can draw small perpendicular lines outside where the rose is to use as guidelines.
 You will need to mix it before you place the rose on the ceiling

, Apply the cornice adhesive with a one-half inch (12mm) notched spreader. Don’t apply it within a few inches (5cm) of the edges, because it will spread toward the ends.
 Push the rose against the ceiling, paying attention to your marked guidelines. Hold it in place for three minutes, or however long the adhesive package suggests.
 Screw it in three to four places.
, You can also use a small amount of matching paint to cover the screw heads.,
