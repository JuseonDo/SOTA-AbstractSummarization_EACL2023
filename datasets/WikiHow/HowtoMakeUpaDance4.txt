 This is particularly important if you’re practicing with a team, but it’s also good to schedule time to practice if you’re practicing alone. This will make you more likely to stick to your routine. Try to practice the dance in sections.
 This will happen naturally as you are inspired day by day.


If you’re practicing with a group you shouldn’t make dramatic changes, but it’s perfectly fine to incorporate some of these tweaks.
 Then you’ll be ready to perform! Once you’ve completely embedded the dance into your muscle memory you’ll be much more confident performing in front of people. Good luck.
