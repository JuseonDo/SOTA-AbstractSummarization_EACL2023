 See what appeals to you and research what type of sites are successful.;
, Many sites exist already that are used by the general dating public, so hitting a more specialized dating market (college-age singles, over 35 singles, AARP member singles, arts-oriented singles, wine enthusiast singles, etc.) is the key.
: Nationality, religion, language, etc. Also contain likes and dislikes, hobbies, etc.
 Display your logo on your site and all of your business communications. Branding is key to making your site attractive and to have a real "presence" in the online world--which is where you will find most of your customers.
 It's probably not necessary to obtain a business license. Just having social security number tax documentation is usually sufficient.
 Many site builder sites are available and affordable and will walk you through the steps of how to start an Internet dating site. Many sites use templates to make the process quick and easy, and some "builder" sites are even specifically geared towards creating a dating site.
 It's not necessary to even set up a merchant account. Reliable third party sites like PayPal are easy to use for accepting payments via email.
 Search social media sites for singles to target. Advertise at singles' events and events that suite your site's niche. Do a major e-mail blast to singles, with special offers to provoke interest. Note that new dating sites are no longer allowed to advertise on Facebook.
 Applaud yourself for learning how to set up your own Internet dating site. Go live and watch your online dating business take off.
