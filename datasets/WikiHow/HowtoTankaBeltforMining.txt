 You will not want to destroy the rats though, so fit the ship for sheer tanking power.;
, Mercoxit, Crokite, and Bistot are always miner magnets.
 If you cannot stand the stress, get away.
 You can advertise the belt in Local, Alliance, Corp, or any chat channel.
 They will respawn and attack your miners.
 You will need to negotiate this with the miners. Once the miners are all gone, kill the rats if possible.
