 Avoid anti-bacterial, scented, and other specialized soaps, since these may damage your plants.
 Use either canola or vegetable oil.
 Mix thoroughly.
 Give the mixture another shake inside the bottle to combine it more thoroughly.
 This step allows you to make sure that the mix will not cause more harm than good. If the section of the plant you test the spray on wilts or changes color, try using a different soap for this pesticide or another type of pesticide.
 If you tested your solution and it did not cause any harm to your plant, spray it around your entire plant, including the undersides of leaves. Focus on areas where pests lay their eggs, since an oil spray is designed to target eggs and immature bugs.
