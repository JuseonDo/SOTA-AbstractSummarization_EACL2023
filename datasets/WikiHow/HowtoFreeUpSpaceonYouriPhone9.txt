, Widgets were a feature that began in iOS 7 but were more personal once iOS 8 arrived. If you have a lot of unused ones or they are no longer used, they can be moved around. This may differ. In iOS 10, you'll have to swipe to the right to display the items on the left of the Notification Center page. However, in iOS 7, 8 and 9, you'll have to tap the "Today" button from the very top of the screen.

Widgets can be reinstalled from the list of widgets page by tapping the green + to the left of the widget below the list of present widgets.
 If there is a line called "#" of new widgets available, you've scrolled too far, and you'll need to look directly above it. You'll see this button directly below the last widget in the list., These widgets should be at the very top of the screen and should contain a red "-" button., This should bring into view a "Remove" button., Tap the "Remove" button. Removing widgets gives you a slight increase in space, so be prepared to check all other alternatives to ensure you are gaining space accurately., Tap the Done button.,, Tap the home button or slide the Widget page/Notification Center back up to the top of the screen.
