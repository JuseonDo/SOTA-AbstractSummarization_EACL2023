 Also get any kind of ice cream.,,,, For a bonus you can get mini chocolate chips (regular ones work just as well) and put them around the outside of the ice cream.

You can put any kind of chip on it, white chocolate, dark chocolate, butterscotch, etc.
 If you are not going to eat it right away, put it on the plate and in a freezer. On the other hand if you can't resist put back on the plate and enjoy this tasty treat!
