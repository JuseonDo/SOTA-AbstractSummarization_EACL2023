 Facebook no longer allows you to filter messages you receive. Instead, you can only set specific users to be blocked. This is the only way to control who can send you messages.;
, You'll find this to the right of the Notifications (globe) button.
 This will open a field that you can enter a user's name into.
 Suggestions will appear as you type, allowing you to quickly select the correct person.
 You will no longer receive messages from that person, and they will no longer be able to see your posts.
 Besides blocking people from sending you messages, you can also limit who can send you friend requests:


Open the padlock menu again if you closed it.
Click the "Who can contact me?" option.
Set your friend request privacy settings to "Everyone" or "Friends of friends."
