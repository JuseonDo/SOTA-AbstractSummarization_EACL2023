@summary
take around 40 plastic bags that are clean and 'not' made of degradable plastic.

@summary
cast on as many stitches as you want with needles around size 3-4mm, until your work is as wide as you want your bag to be.

@summary
,

@summary
knit until your work is twice as long as you want your bag to be.

@summary
cast off and fold your work in half.

@summary
cast on again, creating enough stitches to knit a narrow strap for your bag.

@summary
make two of these straps, and sew one to each side of the top inside of your bag with about 8 centimeter (3.1 in) of overlap at each end.

 Degradable bags are often marked proudly as such, and will disintegrate after a few months. Cut the seam off the bottom of a bag and remove the handles. Flatten out your bag and cut it in a long spiral from top to bottom, into one long strip 3cm (1in) wide. See this article for more information on preparing the bag prior to knitting.;
,, If you get to the end of a piece of "yarn", tie the end to the end of another piece and continue to knit. (Alternatively, you can knit with two strands for a few inches and then drop the old "yarn" and continue with the new.)

, Sew up the sides of your bag with more strips of plastic. You should use a crochet hook, as it won't make as many holes in the existing strips as a yarn needle will.
 Knit until the strap is long enough to be attached to the bag at both ends with about 8 centimeter (3.1 in) of overlap. Bear in mind that your straps will stretch a little when you have heavier things in the bag.
 Alternatively, there are patterns online for making a bag with fancier handles that are more challenging to knit.
