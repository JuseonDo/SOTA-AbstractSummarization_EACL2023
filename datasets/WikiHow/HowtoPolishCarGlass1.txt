 When washing your car, cleaning and polishing the windows should be the last thing you do. You should also clean the glass while working out of direct sunlight, while the windows are fairly dry. Otherwise, the sun may dry out the glass cleaner, leaving streaks behind.;
, A microfiber towel is also a necessity, since it has enough abrasiveness to gently scrub the surface of the glass without scratching it.
 You need to be able to have clear access to the top edge of the glass.
 Clean the glass by wiping the cleaner onto the window using your microfiber cloth, moving from side to side. Cover both sides of the glass.
 Remove any remaining wetness on your windows by drying them with the dry side of the cloth.
 Spray with glass cleaner, wipe the cleaner on, and wipe the cleaner off.
 Spray the cleaner on the windshields and wipe it with your microfiber cloth, moving both up and down and side to side. Remove the dampness with the dry side of your cloth.
 Once the stubborn grime has been cleaned off your windows, you can remove any streaks or film with clean, plain water. Gently spray the glass, using a hose for the outside and a spray bottle for the inside. Wipe the glass dry with a clean microfiber towel.
