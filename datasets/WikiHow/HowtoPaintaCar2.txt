 Prime any surface you used body filler or removed rust from, feathering these areas to a smooth transition and applying enough paint to fill scratches or pits left in the preparation process.
 Check the information on the container. Primer curing times may differ, and some primers require recoating (applying finish paint) in a certain time period after application.
 Use a 600 grit wet/dry paper to smooth paint runs or drips smooth to the surface, being careful not to sand too far and exposing the metal again.
 Wipe it using a wax and grease remover or acetone.
 Prepare the paint for spraying according to manufacturer's directions. Automotive enamels and some polyurethanes give better results with a hardener or catalyst.

Make sure the paint is thinned correctly for the equipment you are using, but avoid over-thinning, which will decrease the gloss of the finished surface and can cause runs.
 When using a catalyst, your paint should be dry to touch in less than 24 hours with full cure taking as long as 7 days depending of the product. During the interval between beginning the painting process and tack free time, the car must remain free of dust.
 Use 1200 or finer grit wet sandpaper, and sand the finish coat of paint until it is perfectly smooth. Rinse any sanding residue from the surface and allow it to dry.

Clear-Coat may be used if desired to give a deeper, higher gloss look.
Clear-Coat may be sanded with 1500 grit wet sandpaper to remove small runs, dirt, and other minor imperfections.
 This step is best accomplished by hand, but buffing machines and power polishers are available that can make it much easier. Be cautious, as they can ruin a paint job if misused. It may be a good idea when using a machine to tape off the edges and buff them by hand.
