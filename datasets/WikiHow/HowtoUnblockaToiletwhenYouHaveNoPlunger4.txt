 You will require about 3 kilograms of caustic soda, a plastic bucket, a plastic pipe or any long plastic object to help stir, rubber/plastic gloves, goggles for your own safety and protection.


Never pour caustic soda directly into the toilet. Caustic soda crystals can solidify inside the toilet pipes creating a bigger block. So it is essential to mix caustic soda in water first before using the solution to unblock your clogged toilet.
, Cover your nose with a piece of cloth, slowly add about 1 kg of caustic soda into the water very slowly. Stir the mixture slowly.









Make sure the room is well ventilated and do not inhale the fumes.
Get away from the room if it is taking longer to mix water and caustic soda.
Always add caustic soda to water, do not do it the other way. Do not add water to caustic soda, as the exothermic reaction between water and caustic soda will make the water boil quickly.
 Do not touch the mixture with bare hands as it will be highly corrosive. If a drop of the mixture falls on your skin, wash it with lots of water.
 Cover the toilet seat and get away from the toilet for about 45 minutes.
 and slowly pour it into the toilet and leave it overnight.
 By now the toilet will be able to flush out quickly. If not, mix water and caustic soda again as described above and pour it into the empty toilet. Wait for couple of hours and pour hot water into the toilet.
