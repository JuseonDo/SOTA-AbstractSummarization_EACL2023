, You can paint walls alternative colors as well, like purple or burnt orange. A great painting technique would be drawing a mural of a sunset, writing "Hollister," drawing a picture of a seagull, or just buying the stencil. But be careful: dark colors will possibly make rooms seem smaller. If painting isn't an option, hanging up scarves would be fine.
, Use beige or navy blue colors for pillows, throws and comforters. A canopy is an optional piece that will improve the room.
 Remember to stick with chocolate brown woods. Seating is recommended as well. Leather would be great, but it really doesn't matter.
, Try buying a pair of white curtains, which are usually not that expensive, or some roman shades. PBteen makes some nice twisted curtains that have a SoCal feel.
 To make this room clearly a Hollister luxury, you must have some sort of photo/poster. You can use their bags as storage. You can put up photos of their models (you can get these off the website's gallery) as art. Other fun art pieces would be putting up signs like "Laguna Beach" or "Surf boards needed beyond this point."

, You can add vanilla candles to add scent, as well as spraying their perfume as air freshener.
