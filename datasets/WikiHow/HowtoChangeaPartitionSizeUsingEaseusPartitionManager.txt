@summary
to add that space to the e: drive, you must first move the unallocated space beside the e: drive.

@summary
now that the unallocated space is in the proper position, the e: drive can simply be dragged over until it meets the beginning of the f: drive, and all of the unallocated space will be assigned to the e: drive.

@summary

 Go to http://www.partition-tool.com/download.htm to download the latest home edition. There are professional editions that have more features and cost money, but the home version is free and is more than capable for resizing and moving partitions.;
, You should see a screen similar to this one:

, For this example, 2GB will be taken from the F: drive and added to the E: drive. Note: The unallocated space that is already there is only 7.8 MB, if that were a larger space then that could be used without changing the size of the F: drive at all.
 Note: You can also resize the partition by simply grabbing the right side of the bar and dragging it, but this is less exact. By opening the Resize/Move window an exact amount can be entered.
 For this example, the F: drive will be made smaller by 2GB, so the partition size is changed from 56282.4 to 54282.4, and then the Unallocated space is updated to 2000.0 MB.
, To do this, simply click and drag the F: drive to the right, and the Unallocated space will be put in its place (between the F: and E:).
, All of the operations that we require for this task have been completed, so we are now able to move forward and perform the partition resizing. To perform the operations, click on Apply in the bottom left of the screen, and answer yes to both prompts. Note: Clicking apply will restart the computer, so make sure you have no open programs or unsaved documents.


The actual process of changing the partition sizes and moving data may take longer depending on how much data is contained in that partition. For this example, the F: drive had 33GB to be moved and it took about 15 minutes.
