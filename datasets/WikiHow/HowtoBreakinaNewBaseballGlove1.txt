 Most manufacturers offer oils specifically formulated to treat their gloves. Applying a small amount of conditioning oil will soften, enrich, and preserve the leather in the pocket of your glove.


You can use some shaving cream with lanolin in it as a cheap alternative to conditioning oil.Do not use too much oil or cream on your glove. Applying too much can cause the leather to deteriorate. Use just enough to apply a light coating all over the pocket. ;
, They're not the same thing. Softball gloves have slightly larger pockets to fit the slightly larger ball.
 Put it in the "sweet spot." The sweet spot is where you would ideally catch the ball, in the lower part of the webbing between the thumb and forefinger.
 The bands should be tight so that the ball rests snugly in the pocket of the glove and not be able to move around. This is to shape the pocket to fit the ball.


Don't use string for this. Tightly wound string or twine can leave an odd-looking imprint around the outside of the glove.
 The sunlight will make the leather warm and flexible. Do not leave the glove on a hot surface. You don't want to cook it.
 Shape the glove by punching your fist into the pocket and opening and closing the glove. Throw the ball hard many times into the center of the glove's pocket, and close the glove over the ball as soon as it hits the webbing. The more you do this, the better the ball will fit and the more you'll develop a feel for catching and retaining the ball.
 Store it for a day or two in a dark, dry spot. Choose an out-of-the-way place away from pets and small children (who might disturb the process).
 Remove the bands and ball. Your glove should be ready for action. The more you use it, the more the glove will conform to your hand.
