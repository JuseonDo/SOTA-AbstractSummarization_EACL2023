 Robloxians usually find other Robloxians by watching their videos (e.g. Telamon).;
,,, Players are more inclined to follow leaders.
 They'll think, "Wow, that guy must be really caring. We should appreciate him."

,, They'll get really mad at you, and it'll hurt your ROBLOX reputation.
 People think regularly of people with ordinary clothing.
 To get badges that not a lot of people have, go to a place that barely anyone is on.


Having badges such as the Bloxxer Badge, the Homestead Badge, the Bricksmith Badge, the Inviter Badge, and the Ambassador Badge are such badges that not everyone has.






Having the Veteran Badge is also great, but it just means that you've been around for more than a year. After all, some noobs can be veterans on Roblox as well, right?







,,, Maybe you could be famous for that. You'd be known as a knight of Robloxia (e.g. a really good fighter).


This can also apply to those who are very good at shooting.
However, this should only be practiced on Roblox games that involve combat as a necessity (e.g. something with a title like "Combat Wars"). Or this can give your reputation a bad rap.
 You will have more options available to you. And you'll be noticed as a VIP of Roblox.
 You could try to teach others how to script.
 Chances are that free models are more likely to make your place lag, so if someone is having a lag problem, you could help them out by showing them how to build their own things.
