, Bring them to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes until they're cooked. Allow the chicken to cool in the water. When cooled, drain them and chop the breasts into bite-sized pieces.


Unlike above, traditionally they are not spiced, but season the chicken however you'd like!
If you're under time pressure, you can also use left over chicken or fry it instead. However, the results are a lot better if you cook the chicken in water, as they'll become very succulent and moist.
 Continue the cooking process for 4 minutes. Remove and drain, then place it in ice cold water to stop the cooking process instantly. Set it aside.
 If you don't have an ovenproof container, use origami tin foil or parchment paper instead. Never use plastic because it'll melt during the process.
 Pour the mixture over the chicken and broccoli.
 Sprinkle it over the broccoli and chicken inside the dish.
 Take the dish out of the oven once time has come.
 Serve with vegetables or salad.
