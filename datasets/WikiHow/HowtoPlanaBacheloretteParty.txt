 Depending on the type of event you want to organize, you may want to include both the bride and groom's mothers. Consult the bride to see if she would like to invite anyone else.;
, If it's not a surprise for the bride, then you can include her in this decision, along with the girls in the wedding party. However, the bride should not be involved in any further decision making.
 Everyone will be contributing, so make sure everyone is satisfied with what they will have to pay. Include all costs involved during the whole event, including travel, food and cover charges. Remember to divide up the bride's portion between guests so that she doesn't have to pay for anything.
 Strippers and sex toy demonstrations may be offensive to some, so take all guests into consideration. Consider a day at the spa or the beach, a concert, or dinner and a club as inclusive events. If the budget allows, then think about a night or two at a fancy resort that includes a spa treatment and expensive dinner. If you have enough people, ask the restaurant to create a set menu so that everyone knows the cost of the meal up front.
 Some bigger cities have party buses or party peddlers for rent. A limousine can also be rented for the evening.
 The other guests may also want to wear something special to stand out from the crowd, like feather boas.
 Make posters with the bride's new name, hang streamers and blow up pictures of her fiancé .
 Scavengers hunt, bride trivia, or pin the tail on the male are just a few ideas.
 Many of these events require booking, so you want to have a good count of people early enough to make a reservation. Remind guests that the event is a surprise, if it is, and inform them of any cover fees or other costs they have to come up with.
 You can then pay for everything the night of the party to alleviate confusion of dividing up checks.
