 Either spray cooking spray over it or use parchment (baking) paper to cover the baking pan.


The benefit of using parchment (baking) paper is that you can easily lift your treats out of the tray and cut them with a pizza cutter.;
, Use low heat.
 Stir in until the marshmallows melt completely.
, To coat the Rice Krispies® well, stir the melted butter and marshmallow mix over them gently.
, Do this either by pushing on the mixture with your hands through wax paper that you've laid over the top, or press down using a heavily buttered or oiled spatula.
 Once cooled, cut the slab into 2 inch (5cm) square shapes.
 Rice Krispies® treats are always best and at their freshest on the day they're made, so invite over a crowd!
