@summary
while tuning with the pegs, hold the violin in front of you so that you can see the strings and so that the bottom part of the instrument rests on your legs.

@summary
locate the correct peg that you will be using to tune.

@summary
once you have located the peg that you will be turning, you are ready to tune!,

@summary
with one hand, grip the desired peg.

@summary
as you turn the peg, pluck the string you are tuning but still keep a firm hold on your violin.

@summary
when you would like to stop turning the peg, you should gently push the peg into the instrument to reinforce its position.

@summary
when the peg finally sticks in place, pluck the string again and listen carefully.

@summary
when you pluck the string and the pitch is just a little out of tune, then you may use a fine tuner to perfect the pitch.

 One hand should always be firmly holding the violin and the other hand should be tuning. This position will help you to create the force needed to turn the pegs correctly and it will keep your instrument safe.
 Pegs, which are often made of ebony, are knobs located on the neck of your violin near the top. Observe that each of your violin's four strings is attached to one of the four pegs. Turning one of these pegs tightens or loosens one of the strings, therefore changing its pitch. If you are tuning "E," for example, then you will be turning the bottom right peg. If you are tuning "A," you will be turning the top right peg. If you are tuning "D," you will be turning the top left peg. And, finally, if you are tuning "G," you will be turning the bottom left peg.
 Keep in mind the proper tuning position.
 You will be turning the peg “towards” you or “away” from you based on how you would like to change the current pitch of the string.









For strings that are very “sharp”, or high-pitched, you will need to turn the peg “towards” yourself.
For strings that are very “flat” or low-pitched, you will need to turn the peg “away“ from yourself.
 It is important to pluck the string so that you can hear how the pitch is changing.
 This will help keep the peg in place so that the tension won’t move it and make the string slip further out of tune. This can be difficult, so have patience! You can also gently push the pegs in as you're tuning.
 Is the string too high? Too low? Can it be tuned with a fine tuner, or is it so out of tune that you need to turn the peg some more?








, When it sounds just right, then you are finished. Congratulations! Time to move on to the other strings. Just as in the fine tuner method, the next string you should tune after "A" is "D", which is to the left of "A." Then, after you tune "D," you should try tuning "G." "G" is to the left of "D." Lastly, once all of the other strings are tuned, you can tune "E."
