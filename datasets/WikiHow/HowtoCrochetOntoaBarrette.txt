 This one was broken, but it could have been covered right over the original plastic. The main thing you'll need is a section you can reach all the way around.
 Snap off the plastic piece and pop out the metal spring, leaving the top surface of the barrette clear. You can leave it on if it's not broken and crochet over it to make a new style.,, Hold the yarn behind and above the barrette. Pass the hook under the barrette.

This is a basic single crochet, but it's worked onto the barrette instead of into a row of stitches.
 Draw the loop up to the top and leave it on your hook., You should now have a total of three loops on your hook.,,,, Single crochet two into each single crochet., Chain 2 (turning chain) and work two single crochets in each single crochet. Work as many rows as desired. Each row will make the finished barrette a little larger and a lot more ruffled.,, If you have holes at the ends of the barrette to stitch into, take the opportunity to tack down the ends of the ruffle.
