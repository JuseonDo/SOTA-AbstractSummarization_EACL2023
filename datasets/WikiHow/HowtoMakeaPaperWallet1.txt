 Even paper from a notebook will work, as long as it is big enough. Ideally, work with colored printer paper. No need to cut it into a square! 8.5 x 11 like it is is just dandy.









It'll be easier to design it before you start folding and cutting. So if you plan on coloring your wallet, do it now.;
, You're folding it about 1/3 of the way up.
 Only this time, do it from top to bottom.
, That's 2.5 cm for you metric system folks.
 At the top where you cut the paper, fold it down on all sides.
,,, Take the paper from the inside, and fold it a tiny bit on both sides. Do you see the wallet taking shape?








, Now you should have a large, long pocket for your bills and two flaps to hold your credit or business cards.
