 Symptoms last for approximately one week, and normally resolve after that without needing any medical help or interventions. For babies and young children, however, it can be a different story.


Approximately 20,000 children under the age of five in the United States are hospitalized for flu-related complications every year.
The younger the child, the greater the risk of flu-related complications.
 This way, he or she can receive anti-viral treatment, which reduces the risk of complications and reduces the length of time your baby will be sick.
 Complications that may arise as a result of the flu virus include:


Pneumonia (an infection that progresses to the lungs)
Severe dehydration
Ear and sinus infections
Worsening of any other health conditions your baby may have
Rarely, the flu can lead to death in babies, which is why prompt medical attention and appropriate treatment is key.
