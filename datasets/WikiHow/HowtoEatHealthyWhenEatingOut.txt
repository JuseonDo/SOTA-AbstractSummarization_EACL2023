 Whenever possible, if you're hungry, eat a small amount of some healthy food (vegetables- including cooked/roasted, a fruit, yogurt etc.) at home. Not being hungry when it's time to order at the restaurant helps in making better decisions regarding the type and amount of food.
 Before making reservations or sitting down at the table, ask the restaurant if they will do the following things:


Accommodate requests on cooking instructions and ingredients.
Use lean cuts of meat and trim visible fat from poultry or meat.
Serve butter, gravy, sauces and dressings on the side so you can add only the amount you need.
Offer margarine instead of butter and low fat milk instead of cream.
 Avoid cooking methods that use oils and fats, such as frying.
, Be sure to order the dressing on the side and only use as much as needed. Try dipping your fork into the dressing to get a small amount on the tines before spearing the lettuce.
 Most restaurant meals have enough food on the plate to serve two people.


Split an entrée with your dinner or lunch partner. Half of a restaurant meal along with a salad is probably enough food.
Eat half of the portion served to you and then bring the rest home to eat another time.
Skip the entrée altogether and just order an appetizer or a bowl of soup and a salad.
