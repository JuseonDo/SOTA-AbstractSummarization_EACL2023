 When you first join the game, you are going to be small. As such, avoid people and try to eat just the cells that are not players.;
, If someone big is chasing you, hide in the green spiky circles. These are called viruses.


If you are bigger than the virus, you will split, so make sure to only do this when you are small.
If the player that is chasing you is smaller than the virus, or the same size, then this will not work.
 This is where it's recommended that you begin chasing other players. Be careful, though, as you cannot eat cells that are larger than your own cell.
 Many players split themselves to try and eat other players. This can be done by pushing the space bar.


Splitting can send your cell forward, allowing you to eat another cell as long as your split piece is bigger than their entire cell.
 That is how to catch them.
, If you have a loyal team you can feed each other, and protect each other from threats. Teaming is a great way to survive longer. However, Anti-Teaming is added to agar.io, so play in Party mode if you want to team.
,, Then just collect the food it produces without you having to eject mass.
 However, they probably won't fall for it.
