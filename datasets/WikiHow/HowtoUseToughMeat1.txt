 Beef roasts or even nice thick steaks can become more tender by slicing the meat thinly and then cooking. However, because meat is not firm, it can be difficult to get a nice, thin cut on it. But partially freezing the meat will allow it to be sliced quickly and easily.


Put the meat into a plastic bag or wrap in freezer paper and put it in the freezer for about an hour. Lay the meat as flat as you can in the freezer.;
, This works to tenderize meat because it physically shortens the collagen fibers.
