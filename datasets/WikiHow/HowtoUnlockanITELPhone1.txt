 Now that you’re back into your phone, you can set a new unlock pattern., This will bring you to the “Lock Screen” menu.,,, The option you select determines the amount of dots on which you’ll draw your pattern.

For example, if you pick 4x4, the unlock screen will show 4 columns of dots and 4 rows of dots.
 When the dots appear, drag your finger across the dots in your desired pattern. If you make a mistake, tap “Retry.”, Now you’ll have to redraw the pattern, just to make sure it matches., As long as the two patterns match, you’ll return to the Screen Security menu. The next time you unlock your phone, use the pattern you just created.
