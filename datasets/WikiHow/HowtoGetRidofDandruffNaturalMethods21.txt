 Egg oil contains:


Long chain polyunsaturated Omega-3 fatty acids like Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) which revitalize the follicle cells.
Cholesterol which brings luster and shine to hair as well as eliminates dandruff.
 Use shampoo only once as repetition (for a foamy feel) removes the natural lipids of hair and scalp making it dry and brittle.
 Regular, continued use is important for proper nourishment of the follicular cell membranes.



Egg oil is mess free and stable. It is a more convenient alternative to egg yolk masks and does not smell like raw egg yolks or cook in the hair during a hot shower. There is no risk of salmonella which could give you an infection.
