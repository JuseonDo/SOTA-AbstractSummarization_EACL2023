,,, Also discard all things that have been opened a long time ago, all spices that don't smell anymore, and everything you bought years ago but have never used.
 Baking stuff with baking stuff, savoury cans together, sweet cans together, breakfast cereal together, toilet paper, spare soap and toothpaste together and so on.
 Again, go with what is logical to you. If you bake often, the baking stuff can go into a more prominent place then if you hardly ever bake. You can also put all the basic baking ingredients into a wire basket, this will make baking quicker and simpler.
 This way you avoid having to wipe up the flour every time you open the paper bag. It makes it also easier to see how much you have left. But don't forget to label the storage canister.


One good way of doing that is to paint a strip of blackboard paint on it. Now you can wipe off and change the labelling whenever you put something different into the container. Storing food stuff in glass or plastic containers also discourages mice and bugs.
