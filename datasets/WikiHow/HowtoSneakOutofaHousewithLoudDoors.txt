@summary
getting back into the house through the backyard can be hard and noisy.

if you have sticky locks, to ensure that it's noiseless when you unlock your door, put a little spit on the key.as soon as you get back inside, take off your shoes and socks and take down your decoy carefully

 If all the lights are off, a simple decoy will be all that is necessary. If you have dark hair, take a dark shirt or pair of shorts and put it under the blanket on top of the pillow, leaving a little peeking out. In the dark, this is really convincing.;
, If you tread lightly, there should be no problem and you don't have to put on your shoes outside.
 In this case, if a parent catches you, you can just say you were going out to the back to look at the stars. If you have a dog that sleeps out back, you can just say that you thought they were barking and went outside to quiet them down. If you can't sneak out through the back door without making more noise than the front door, then go out the front. There!

, Better safe than sorry.
, It can silence a lot of creaks that you would've heard if you opened it slowly. Make sure it doesn't bump into anything, though.
,, A lot of people don't even have keys to their backyard locks. Only sneak in through the back if it's easy and noiseless.
 This really helps if it's hard to take the key out of the lock. Make sure you wipe off the spit afterwards so your parents don't get suspicious.
