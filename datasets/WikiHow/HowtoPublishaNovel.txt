 You may wish to have your manuscript professionally edited. You should only pitch agents your absolute best work.;
, Top resource books include Writers Market and the Jeff Herman Guide to Literary Agents. Plus, almost every literary agency hosts a website. Consult for the most up-to-date information.
, Dozens of agents specialize in young adult paranormal fiction; don't pitch them if you've written a young adult book about a kid detective.
 A query letter is an agent's first look at you the writer. It needs to be dynamite. It should 1. Tell what you book is about in three compelling sentences; 2. State why you are querying that specific agent; and 3. Explain why you are the person to write this particular book. One page, max.
 Yes, you can query more than one agent at a time. Just be sure to personalize each query and only solicit one agent per literary house. Note: make sure your first chapter is dynamite. Some agents request a first chapter along with your query letter. This is your chance to impress. You need to make the most of it.
 Follow submission instructions closely. At this point it is perfectly acceptable to ask for a reading timeline. A reputable agent should respond to a manuscript within 2-3 months.
 If you do receive an offer of representation, the agent will want to know what else you're working on. Think of it as a long-term relationship.
 If you get it, be prepared with a list of questions. Commission structure? Foreign rights? Editing process? You want to know exactly what you're entering into.
 Remember, an agent needs to sell your book to a publishing house. This may take one week. Or one year. Or it may not happen at all. Be patient and professional in this process and let the agent do his/her job.
 The book The Help was rejected over two dozen times before it was eventually published. Look how that turned out. Literary agents are busy, in-demand folks. But they want to discover the next great novel. Keep after them.
