 One of the best ways to get to know an organization is to become their customer. Advertisers often get preferential treatment for story ideas, event listings and special features.
 A little bit of charm and gift giving can help you develop a friendly professional relationship. If you have a free sample of your product, offer products to use as a contest for the media outlet or send it directly to the person you want to develop a relationship with.


Business gifts must walk a fine line. Don't give bribes or be insincere. However, it is possible to build rapport by providing the media person with an incentive to get to know you away from the office.
 Once you have a few conversations, you must take the initiative to ask for preferential treatment. Try to become the first place they go when there is an opportunity for a discount, a sponsorship or prime ad placement.
 These people are the gatekeepers of a lot of important information. Have a chat with them at least every 6 months, and ask if anything is new at the company and whether they recommend you contact a particular person.
 Call them up to check in and see what they are offering. Relationships must have regular updating to be very useful.
 This is a great way to develop a durable, mutually-beneficial relationship. Consider affiliate marketing, cooperative direct mail, distribution or referrals.
 Store your advertising results on the list or nearby. Refer back to this list of people and past campaigns any time you start a new advertising plan.
