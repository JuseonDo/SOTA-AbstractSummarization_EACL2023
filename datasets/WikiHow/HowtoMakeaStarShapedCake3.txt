, An 11 by 17 inches (28 by 43 centimeters) pan would be ideal. If you can't find any parchment paper, you can grease the pan, then lightly flour it instead., You can make the cake from scratch, or you can use a boxed recipe instead., Most jelly roll pans will need 25 to 30 minutes to bake. Let the cake cool completely, but don't take it out of the pan., The cookie cutter needs to be about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tall and 4½ inches (11.5 centimeters) wide. You should be able to fit 9 stars in the cake., Save the scraps for another recipe., Split the cakes in half using a serrated knife. Spread your favorite filling across the bottom half of each mini cake. Place the upper halves on top when you are done., Fondant is a great option for these types of cakes. You can also decorate them with buttercream frosting as well.
