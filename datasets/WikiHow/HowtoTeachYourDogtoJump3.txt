 Always start with your jumps fairly low. This helps for 2 reasons: It prevents the dog from crawling under, and It helps build confidence. It will also prevent your dog from tripping over the pole. If you can, place a barricade on either side of the jump so your dog will not try to go around. Some good temporary jumps can be made out of simple household items like boxes, piece of wood, and small furniture.
 This will help you guide your dog over the jump, because beginners might be confused. Make sure the lead is reasonably loose.
,, Step over the jump as your dog will hopefully do the same. When your dog is jumping, give a voice command. You can also use a clicker as the dog jumps over the hurdle.
 Pet your dog, praise it, and occasionally give a treat.
 If your dog is tired, let her rest before trying again. Dogs tend to focus better when they aren't tired and hungry.
 Do not push your dog too hard. Hard work pays off in the long run, but too much pressure will not create any progress.
