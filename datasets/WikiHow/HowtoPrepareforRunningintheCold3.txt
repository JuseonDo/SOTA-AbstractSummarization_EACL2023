 Staying warm protects you from getting sick., Wear an undershirt, a regular shirt, a sweatshirt and a hoodie. Wear 2 pairs of pants or wear thermals underneath your regular workout pants.
 By keeping the head and ears warm, you are less likely to become cold. This is because the heat from the body escapes through the top of the head. Therefore, when you sweat a lot, it is very easy to feel uncomfortably cold when exercising in frigid temperatures.
 Keeping the hands warm during cold weather is imperative since cold air can lead to cracked, dry skin and frigid fingers and hands.
