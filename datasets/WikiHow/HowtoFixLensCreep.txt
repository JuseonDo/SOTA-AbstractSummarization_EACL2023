 Make sure to use the dust caps to keep your lens and sensor clean of dust and debris. Only remove your lens in a clean and dust-free area.;
, Using a small screwdriver, being careful not to insert it too far into the lens, lift the edge of the ring nearest to the focal length guide numbers.
 Carefully slide the ring forward exposing the channels.
 Make sure the rubber band drops into the channels and makes firm (but not tight) contact with the screws and brass bushings.
 Use the screwdriver to help lift the ring over the rubber band.
 The ring will set a little high on 3 sides but it should not be too noticeable.
 If the process worked, your lens will not creep forward. If it still creeps, try a smaller/tighter/wider rubber band until it does.
