 The state of Georgia uses Applied Measurement Professionals (AMP) to administer the plumbing exams.
 AMP schedules 3 test windows every year in Georgia. For example, in 2012 you can take the plumbing exam between April 9 and April 20, August 6 to August 17 or December 3 to December 14.
 You can also call them at (913) 541-0400 to get an application form.


Apply 3 months ahead of your preferred exam date. For example, for the December 2012 window, you will need to apply to take the exam by September 21, 2012.
Include an application fee of $133.
 You will receive this about 45 days before your exam. This includes an exam outline so you will know what to expect on the test.
 You will receive this 2 weeks before your exam and it will include information on the location of your exam.


Contact the testing administrator at (800) 345-6559 if you do not receive this notice before your test.
 Your license card will come with the results if you pass the exam. If you fail, you can apply to take it again.
