@summary
melt enough white chocolate to fill one plastic egg.

@summary
melt a few coloured wafers (any colour you want, or rainbow) and drizzle into both parts of the plastic egg.

@summary
once both are swirled, make sure they are both completely full, and as quick as you can shut the egg.

@summary
now, place your egg into ice water to cool.

@summary
after waiting for the egg to cool, (about 15 minutes in ice water, longer without ice water), open the eggs.

@summary
now, melt a bit more of the coloured wafers (any colour, preferably matching the egg's swirls).now your eggs are ready for easter!

 Let it sit for a few minutes to cool, but not harden. Then pour the chocolate into the plastic egg's two parts. Leave room for more chocolate to be added!
, Take your toothpick and swirl the chocolate to make a nice design., Make sure it snaps shut. (If your eggs don't snap shut and fall open easily, skip step 4.), Repeat these steps until you have your desired amount of chocolate eggs., This is the hard part, as it is often difficult to open them. I used steak knives to saw them a bit and then pry them open. There is usually an air bubble at one side of the egg, but I find that this indent is helpful to prevent eggs from rolling around., You can now personalize the eggs. You can write your kid's names, add stripes, polka dots, random swirls, what ever you want. I used toothpicks and Popsicle sticks for this.,
