 If it's cold, pack a coat. If it's warm, don't forget to bring your swimsuit. Sunscreen is also something that tends to be forgotten, yet may be really important!;
, But make sure your bag isn't too big, remember you are only staying one night. The smaller your bag, the less you can pack, which will help you not overpack.



A game console. (But remember unless it is handheld it will take up a lot of room in your suitcase.)
A book.
A DVD, Blu-ray Disc, or video tape + something to play them in.
An mp3 player.
A board game.
Laptop.
