 Up-tempo music has the power to make us exercise at a faster pace. Favorite bands and songs can make you feel happier and more care-free.Limit the sad or slow songs that you listen to while you are stuck.
Listen to something different. Make a new playlist and try some new bands. iTunes Radio and Pandora make it easy to pick a channel based on your favorite artists and find similarly inspirational bands.
 Listen to that person explain how they stay motivated to see if you can adopt some practices outside of your comfort zone.
 Consider asking yourself the following questions on a daily basis:


“When did I feel happiest today?”
“At what point did I find a “flow” where I forgot what I was doing and time passed quickly?”
“What did I look forward to doing?”
“What am I looking forward to in the next few months?”

, Assign a two-week limit to deal with something from the past that is haunting you. Write about it, read about it and cry about it if possible.


Then, make a conscious decision to let it go.
See a counselor during this time if you haven’t spoken to anyone about the problem.
 Coaches are trained to help you see your potential. Hiring one for a short period of time can give you the tough love you need to get back on track.
