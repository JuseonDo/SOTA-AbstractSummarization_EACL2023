 They are readily available at any hardware store, although since they are power tools, they are likely to have hefty price tags. Many hardware supply stores such as Ace Hardware and the Home Depot rent out such tools for a significantly smaller fee. Power grinders are particularly useful for larger rust-covered surface areas such as on old cars.
 Grinders are equipped with removable discs which are interchangeable and replaceable once they’ve been worn down to uselessness. Stripping, fiber, and flap discs work well.


It is best to start grinding away the rust using the largest, toughest of these to quickly do away with the worst of the rust and avoid needlessly wearing down the smaller, more sensitive ones.
 Clamp it down with a vise, if possible, or make sure that it's heavy enough to stand still while you sand away.
 Be sure to keep it in constant motion to avoid accidentally gouging the metal.
 If any minor rust remains, sanding should get rid of it. Power sanders work just like power grinders, except that they vibrate a sanding pad rather than rotate a disc.


Detail sanders are specifically designed for hard to reach places, and should be used for rust on corners and uneven surfaces.
