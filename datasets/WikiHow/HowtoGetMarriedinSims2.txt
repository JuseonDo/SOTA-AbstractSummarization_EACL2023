,, Use your imagination and flirt with the ones that you prefer or like. For example, the maid, gardener, or the pizza delivery guy.
 Let your character build up some passion and preference for another character. If you believe and think that your character has found someone, start flirting.
 Create a pool and have them swim in it, cook a meal together, get a couch and have them chat on it. However, you should avoid force and speed since either of their moods may diminish and disappear.
 Start kissing and appreciate each other. Serenade, Sweet Talk, Romantic kiss, and Admire should do the trick.


If the other Sim likes this attention, line up a whole list of actions. Something like: "Chat, Chat, Sweet Talk, Joke, Chat, Kiss, Chat, Chat, Admire, Serenade".






If that works, and both are in a good mood, them go Propose >> Stay the Night. This will buy some extra time together!







,, Once your Sim has settled down, ask your mate to Join. When you are both on the bed, do Kiss/Make Out or Cuddle. Or just do both.
 There may be a little video that runs automatically. If you selected "Try For Baby", and then heard a line of Lullaby at the end, your girl Sim is pregnant! (I'm sure some of you new "simmers" are wondering what WooHoo means. Sims is a teen rated game, not adult. Therefore, they can't say 'sex' in the game. That's what "Woohooing" is. Note: Teens can not Woohoo...only adults.)

, Click on that, and the video will show them proposing.
 As soon as you phone up the guests, get that Altar thing, a party bar, and a wedding cake! Perhaps even a bottle of wine for a toast!
