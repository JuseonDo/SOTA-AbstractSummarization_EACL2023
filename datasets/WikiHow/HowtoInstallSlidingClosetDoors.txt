 If they are unfinished, then you should paint or stain them before you install them.;
, Determine horizontal and vertical measurements, as well as the width and height of each old closet door.
 If you have sliding doors in place currently, lift each door out of the bottom track first. Then, lower the bottom of each door down onto the floor next to the track. Doing this will pull the door from the top track. Set the old doors aside.
 Use putty to patch up any holes as needed. Paint over any large patches of putty that won't be covered by the new sliding doors.
 Cut the new tracks to fit the closet opening using a hacksaw.



The tracks might have pre-made holes for screwing the brackets into the frame of your closet. If not, create the holes with your drill and install the screws that came with your doors.
Make sure that the screws are flush with the track so that they don't stick out and interfere with the doors' movements. At the same time, don't over-tighten them because you may warp the track.
 The doors have rollers at the top that will fit into the top bracket.


Turn the front of each door so that it's facing you when you lift it.
Lift the door and place it in the top track, starting with the back part. Once the back of the door is in place, the front will fit into the track as well. Repeat this process with the second door.
 Mark where the bottom track needs to be installed.
,, The bottom of the doors will slide into place if all of your measurements are correct.
