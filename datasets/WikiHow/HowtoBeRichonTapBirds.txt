 Remember to tap on the screen and press love in each aviary.
 Don’t leave any empty space in any aviaries. Fill them with birds that you buy and sell; this is what gets you the most money., Don’t buy birds that you can’t afford comfortably, you’ll only be hurting yourself. If you play Tap Birds several times a day, a bird that matures quickly might be beneficial, whereas if you only play once a day, a birds that matures slowly is for you. My personal favorite is the waxwing, I buy and sell twice a day; once in the morning and once in the evening. Just remember to subtract the cost of the bird from your profits, and be wary of breed-able birds, they tend to sell for less., Add all the birds in an aviary to inventory then fill your feeder. One by one release your hungry birds., Click on the bird buck icon and at the bottom you’ll see a blurb that says “earn free bird bucks”. Tap it and you’ll see a list of apps that earn you bird bucks, some of which are free. Check out apps to make sure they aren’t scams before you download, run the app, and then delete it., for if you breed it you will earn more than 45,000 bird points.
