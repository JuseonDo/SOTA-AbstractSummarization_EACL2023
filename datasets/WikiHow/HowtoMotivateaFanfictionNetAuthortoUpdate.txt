 If the author says in their A/N they aren't sure where to go next, then offer a few suggestions of your own about the story.;
, Say that you're really interested in their story, and that you would really like to see an update.
 Sometimes people need a good helping hand to review their work.
 Sometimes knowing that someone is still interested in their work is all it will take to grant an update., It's now or never!
