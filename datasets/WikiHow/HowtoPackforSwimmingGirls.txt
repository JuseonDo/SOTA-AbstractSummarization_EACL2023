, You can also put your bathing suit on under your clothes to save time. But, if you have to pick your suit up from somewhere, it's fine to put it on when you arrive at your destination. You can change in the changing rooms or the bathrooms.
, Spare towels never hurt anyone and they may not have towels available where you are going. If you cannot find or do not own a towel, ask if you can borrow a few from your friends or neighbors.
 Especially if you are going to a chlorinated swimming pool. Wash and condition your hair as soon as you get out to prevent skin irritations and hair discoloration.
 Tidy up your hair after swimming unless you're planning to go straight home.
,,, For older girls, you may want to bring some extra tampons. Who knows what might happen at a pool.
, Body Splash and moisturizer should brighten you day! It is easy to get dry skin after being in chlorinated water.
 Remember to hydrate. In fact, if you hydrate enough you fingers don't prune as much. No person wants to get dehydrated at a pool or a lake. Don't drink the pool or lake water, gross things have been in it. Chlorine and the other chemicals in the water are not meant to be ingested, and may hurt you, but don't get freaked out if you drink some accidentally.
