Coat the pan with nonstick cooking spray if you don't have aluminum foil on hand.
 If the salmon fillets have skin on them, lay them skin-side down on the sheet.


Position the fillets in a single layer, spaced evenly.



When done, you should be able to easily flake the salmon apart with a fork. The middle should also be opaque.
 Salmon fillets can be served warm out of the oven or after they have cooled to room temperature.
