before all else, make sure you are not currently embroiled in a heated argument when you do the following steps.

state clearly and calmly that you choose to smoke.

@summary
explain that this is ultimately your decision and no one else.

@summary
when they bring up the health risks , point out that you are aware of the risks.

@summary
tell them you will not be swayed on the subject.

@summary
if they simply cannot be persuaded to leave you alone: as a last ditch effort to save your rights and relationship with this person suggest a mutual compromise.

 The con-smoker will be in a non-responsive position and nothing will be achieved but frustration and anger which will lead you to want to have a cigarette, thus beginning the cycle again. Wait for a casual moment or relaxed situation where you can both speak calmly without interference from others.;
, Many con-smokers are under the impression that cigarettes have a stranglehold on you. Explain that you are well aware that cigarettes and the chemicals involved are in themselves addictive- but you also enjoy smoking to satisfy your addiction. You know the risks and have chosen to smoke, and to continue to smoke.
 In a calm manner tell the con-smoker that their opinion and feelings mean a lot to you and may be valid, but you disagree with it, and choose to smoke. Remind them that you respect their decision to not smoke, and that you would appreciate if they would respect your decision as well.
 You know them and still choose to smoke. Everyone dies, there is no escaping it, and despite the risks you choose to smoke.
 If you do not intend to quit, do not tell them you'll think about quitting. This fuels a con-smoker. They will feel they have made headway and it will bolster their confidence in the idea that whey will eventually get you to quit. Be firm and state that you have no will or intention to quit, regardless of health risks or others' opinions.
 Try offering to switch to a lighter/less strong cigarette or brand. Remain firm that you will not quit, but that their role in your life is important to you, and you are willing to meet them half-way if they will as well.
