 If you have a tea ball, you can put the root into that first. This way, you won't have to strain it out later.You can slice the fresh ginseng root using a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler.;
, Fill your kettle with water, then let it come to a boil. It is best if you use purified water for this. Because water evaporates as it cooks, boil more water than you think you might need.
 Once the water has come to a boil, take it off of the heat, and let it cool for 2 minutes.High levels of heat can destroy the beneficial properties of many herbs, including ginseng., Measure out the water first, then pour it straight into the cup with the ginseng in it.
 Some people like to place a saucer over the mug so that the tea doesn't cool down too much. The longer you steep the tea, the stronger it will be.
 If you used a tea ball, simply pull the tea ball out and discard the root. If you did not use a tea ball, pour the tea through a fine mesh strainer into another mug.
 It tastes best while it is still warm, but you can drink it cold too. If you are using this tea for medicinal purposes, you can take it 1 to 3 times daily for 3 to 4 weeks.
