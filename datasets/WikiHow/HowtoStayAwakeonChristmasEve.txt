 The best and most comfortable thing is a sleeping bag, because no one wants to sleep on a dirty carpet. If your bedroom is close by or you can peek out into the hall from your bedroom, that's the best option.;
, Your parents (or Santa) might not be very happy if you're up so late. Behind cupboards or couches are good if there's a wall behind them.
 Roll on your side so they can't see your face and drink or eat something with lots of sugar to keep your hyper and energized.
 It will be very quiet so you will have to pay close attention. Most parents will also turn the hall lights off if you/they are going to bed.
, A very good hiding space is underneath the Christmas tree, but make sure you have lots of room.


If your Christmas tree is low to the ground it will probably not be a very good idea.
Most houses have a dining room and a dining table. Hide underneath the dining room table if you really want to. You can also hide under a couch or in a cupboard.
 It's better safe than sorry.
 You will need a very surprised look unless you asked what you are going to get, so start practicing!

, Christmas Eve or the day before Christmas Eve work just fine so your parents don't see your stuff.
 Not too much though because you will probably crash when you're opening your gifts. A few pieces of candy and hot chocolate do well enough to keep you awake.
 On the other hand, going to the bathroom is a great way to create a distraction if you need a quick escape!

, Little kids probably won't want their Christmas spoiled, so get the sleep you'll need for your early morning if you want a surprise!
