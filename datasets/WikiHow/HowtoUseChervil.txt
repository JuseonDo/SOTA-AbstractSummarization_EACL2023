 It is easy to grow in both a pot or in a garden bed. It is best picked before it flowers. If you grow your own, you can enjoy it fresh.;
, This will preserve the delicate flavor best and will not crush the herb too drastically as chopping it on a board will do.
 Chervil is delicate and when overcooked, its flavor quickly dissipates.
 In general, chervil can be used in place of parsley for many dishes. It is perfect with salads, fish, dressings, egg dishes, chicken dishes, and in soups.
 Chervil will not overwhelm the flavor of the salad and is a delicious addition.
