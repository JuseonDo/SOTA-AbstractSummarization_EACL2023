Mess up a bunch of folded blankets, try tossing them!

This effect reversed will look like you instantly folded up blankets and made the house look nice in seconds.


Toss paper plates on the ground one by one

This effect reversed will make it look like you made plates float up towards you.


Take a big mouthful of a beverage and care fully spit it into a cup

This effect reversed will make it look as if your drink just came right up to you with no straw. For an even grosser effect, try spitting a mouthful of water or lemonade into a toilet, then reversing it.


Eat the food and reverse it.

It will look like your making food magically appear in you mouth; to make it even cooler try it with money!
