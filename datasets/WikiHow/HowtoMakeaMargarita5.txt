, Use a freshly cut lime to wet the rim of chilled glass. Dip the glass rim-first into a saucer of coarsely ground salt or sugar.


Note that this recipe will make enough for at least a couple of drinks.
 Give it a stir and let it sit for 30 seconds to help dissolve the sugar.


How much triple sec you add, if any, will depend on your tastes. Try starting with a 1/2 cup of triple sec.
 Fill the shaker 2/3 to 3/4 full with ice, close the lid, and shake vigorously for at least 15 seconds.
 Once the ingredients are well mixed, remove the lid from the shaker and pour the mixture into your chilled, salt-rimmed glass.
 Add 1/2 to 3/4 a cup of beer to your glass. You may want to start with 1/2 a cup of beer and then give the drink a taste before you add more.
 Stir the ingredients together and give the drink a taste. Adjust it to your liking and stir.


At this point, you may want to add some carbonated water to the mixture to make it more fizzy.
 Once you’re happy with your drink's flavor, add some chipped ice, give it a stir, and enjoy!
