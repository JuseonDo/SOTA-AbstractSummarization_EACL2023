 Instead of using just one piece of wire, you'll need two pieces: one should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long, the other about 2 yards (1.8 m). Strip all four wire ends back about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
 It's a good idea to contain the energy you're working with in a bowl that won't conduct electricity.
 Starting about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the end of the wire, wrap the nail from the head to the end with tight coils that touch, but do not overlap. Continue wrapping until the entire nail is covered.
 Attach one end of the wire wrapped around the nail to the positive end of the battery. Attach one end of the smaller piece of wire around the other side of the battery.
 If you don't want to buy a switch, make your own by following these instructions:


Get a small block of wood, two thumbtacks, and a paperclip.
Tack the end of the copper wire wrapped around the nail to the block of wood by wrapping it around the metal part of a thumbtack and pushing it into the wood.
Wrap the end of the short wire leading from the battery around the other tack. Use the tack to fasten the paperclip to the wood about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the first tack.
 To make the electric current flow, turn the switch on. If you're using a homemade switch, slide the paperclip toward the first tack until it touches the tack. This will complete the circuit and cause the current to flow. To switch off the current, swivel the paperclip away from the first tack.
