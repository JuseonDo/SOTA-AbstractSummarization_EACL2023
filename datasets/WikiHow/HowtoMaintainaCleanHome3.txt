 Use a paper or cloth towel to wipe it down quickly. It should take only a few seconds, and if there's no visible debris on the mirror, skip the step. You'll get to it when you do your heavier cleaning.
 If you didn't clean the mirror, simply spray the cleaner in the sink and on the faucet and wipe up. Spend no more than 30 seconds on this step unless you have trouble spots that need attention.
 Make sure to do the toilet last. These tasks take only 1 minute to do.
 It should take only 30 seconds. Leaving a ring to sit will make heavier cleaning take longer. If there's no ring, skip it for later.
