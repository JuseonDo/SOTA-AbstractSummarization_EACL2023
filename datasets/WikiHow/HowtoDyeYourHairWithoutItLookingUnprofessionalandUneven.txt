 Be conservative and only change the color of your natural hair by a few shades. This will ensure that you stay true to a color that matches your skin tone and that you aren’t shocked by the results.;
, Assess your budget and do research online to see what brands are recommended within your price range. A good product can make all the difference when you want your hair to look professionally done.
 Find a space with as much natural light as possible, and get all the materials out on the counter so you don’t spill or fumble.
 Having an extra set of eyes and hands will ensure that your hair is dyed evenly.
 By not shampooing your hair right before you dye, you are allowing the natural oils to protect your scalp.
 Every box of hair dye has different instructions, so even if you have dyed your hair before, you should still follow along carefully.
 Before you begin, test the dye on a small strand of hair. This will allow you to make sure that you like the color and to figure out how long you need to leave the dye in.
 This will keep you from accidentally dyeing your skin.
, Clip all but one section back at a time. Using the smaller divisions means its less likely that you will miss a spot.
, As soon as your hair has been coated evenly, start the clock. This is usually about 20 minutes for most dyes.
 This allows your hair to fully absorb and lock in the color.
 Use a deep conditioning treatment at least once a week to keep up the color and shine of your hair.
 Because the chlorine in the water can change the color of your hair, it’s best to stay away for at least two weeks.
