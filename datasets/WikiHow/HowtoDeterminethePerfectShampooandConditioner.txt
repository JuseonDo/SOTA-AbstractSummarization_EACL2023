 The best places to buy hair products are reputable salons.;
, More volume? Shine? Repairing damage? Going into your search with a clear picture of what you hope to accomplish will speed the process along.
 You may not always be able to achieve your desired results when you have these factors.
 Check for allergens or drug facts on the bottles. Sometimes shampoos and conditioners may contain natural or artificial ingredients which may irritate your skin. They may also contain ingredients you may not wish to put into your hair such as alcohols and sulfates.
 It may take a few attempts at finding your ideal hair products and if the particular salon or store does not have a suitable return policy you may want to change locales. The last thing you want is to be stuck with lots of products you will never use.
 Salons that are concerned with customer service generally will give the samples to you at little to no cost. Most stores do not usually practice this.
 The professional may be able to look at or feel your hair to determine if the product you have chosen is suitable for your hair type. They may also be able to determine if you have specialized needs that should be addressed.
 This may better help you determine the results of a product before you buy.
 The results are sometimes not what you expect on the first wash because the new products can remove the residues of the old products. This may cause dullness or roughness in the hair until all the buildup is removed.
 The professional may be able to direct you to something better.
