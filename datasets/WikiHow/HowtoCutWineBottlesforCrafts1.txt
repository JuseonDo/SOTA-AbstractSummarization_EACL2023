, Keep it tight, trying to leave the string in a nice ring.
 The acetone will burn, heating the bottle along your string line to make it break off cleanly. It only needs to soak for a few minutes.
 You can put the string anywhere, depending on how tall you want your bottle. This is more or less where the bottle will cut.
 The string should catch quickly. Always have your bucket of water right there on hand to prevent any mistakes or accidents.
 Use both hands to turn the bottle as if it were a piece of corn. Keep spinning until the acetone stops burning, which is usually when it starts to smoke.
 The abrupt change in temperature should sheer the bottle right where the flame was. Take a piece of sandpaper and smooth out the edges to prevent any possible shards or rough spots.
