 If it is a half day, you will not need to worry about this step unless it goes past lunch.;
, You will want something casual, a little more pretty than you usually would. Don't overdo what you will wear. Pick cute shoes that are casual too, like flats. If you have uniforms, set out your uniforms as well. Make sure your outfit is not wrinkled and is clean.
 Pack the rest of your backpack with personal items like a water bottle, book, etc. Make sure to leave room for your lunch. Don't make it too heavy though.
 You might need to rush. Make sure it is good for you, and is also yummy. Make sure you have what you need.
 Use good smelling shampoo, conditioner, and body soap. Comb your hair in the shower so it is more smooth and silky. Brush and dry your hair. Please don't skip this step.
 Add a cute accessory like a bow, a headband, or a colorful clip too. Listen to your mom or older siblings for advice.
 Clean your ears, clean, clip, or polish your nails, wear deodorant if needed , wash your face twice daily, put on nice smelling lotion, and brush your teeth well.
 If you don't have some, ask your mom or sister if you could wear a little. It will make you smell beautiful, and will also boost your self esteem. If you're allowed, put a little lip gloss on. Don't over do it.
 You can get tips, advice, and help.
 The kids in younger grades are most likely going to be looking up at you for an example. So be that example!
