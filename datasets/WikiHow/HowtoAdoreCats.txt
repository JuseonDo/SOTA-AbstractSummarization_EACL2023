,, You will find out how amazing and stealthy these majestic predators really are.
 You can search online to find out about the history of domesticated cats or you can pick up a book at a local library.
,, If you are put off because they can attack birds or other small pets, don't get mad. Cats are predatory in nature and it is their instinct to hunt. Make sure any pets are secure and put out cat food. Many cats that haven't seen birds before are only curious, or even scared of them.
