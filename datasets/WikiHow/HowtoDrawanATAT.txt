@summary
draw two lines that point up, then slant them to the right a bit.

@summary
create a lower line that comes out, then sharply turns up.

@summary
add a line that protrudes from the bottom of the 'rainbow' and do the same a bit farther up and just below and behind the windscreen.

@summary
make a small angled square below the main 'head.',

@summary
make two lines that darken in the center protrude from the two points at the rear of the 'head.',

@summary
add some armor patches to the center area of the last few lines that you made.

@summary
duplicate the last step behind the leg.

@summary
repeat this process to create the forward legs.

 Afterwards flatten them out.;
, Draw a windscreen by making a filled in rectangle near the upper center. Make two half circles, one inside the other like a rainbow, and finally add a small square behind the windscreen for an armor pad.
 Make the line a bit thicker near the rainbow, and make a bottle shape for the blasters.
 Add two lines like the main blasters that you just made and add some armor patches if you want.
 Then, make two lines that are similar to the first two lines that you made, have them point up again. After this, have the lines flatten out and point towards the right. Angle them slightly down, then completely down.
 Create two lines that come straight down, then round at the center, then continue on the path down. Create half circles that turn into ovals at the bottom, have the two lines at the bottom of the ovals meet. Add a black square at the center of the two lines you just made. This makes the first of the four legs.
 Add darken triangles on either side for shadows.
 You can bend one of the forward legs to make it look like it just took a step. Finish it up with by connecting the legs with a line, and adding a snow speeder if you want!
