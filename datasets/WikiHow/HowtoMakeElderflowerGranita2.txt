Bring 1/2 cup water to the boil.
Add the fresh or dried rosemary to the water.
Remove from the heat. Set aside for 1/2 an hour to infuse. Added flavour can be released by pressing down on the rosemary leaves with a spoon.
 Add the pieces to the blender or food processor with the elderflower cordial. Blend or process to a pur√©e.,, Add the lemon or lime juice and stir to combine., Add a cover and place in the freezer.

After 2 hours, remove from the freezer and break up with a fork. This helps the ice crystals to form properly.
Continue doing this every hour until the granita freezes properly.
 Scoop the granita into dessert bowls and serve. Garnish with a cucumber curl or a small sprig of rosemary.
