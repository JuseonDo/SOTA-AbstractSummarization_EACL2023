 If you do, then you will form a connection and they might start thinking differently about you. Every now and then drop hints about who they like.;
,, Find out if they like you and then you won't be so scared of rejection.
 Don't move things too fast, or they will think you're pushy.
 This is always a good thing because if you don't, you will lose a good friend and the other person will feel uncomfortable. Also they may change their mind and want to go out with you, so it's good to stay in touch.
 If you read this, and you got some ideas, but you don't know if the person likes you, don't be afraid to ask. Just make sure to do it in private with no other friends around.
