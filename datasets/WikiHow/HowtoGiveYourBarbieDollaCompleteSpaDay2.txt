, This will only last for a day or two. You can rinse it off later with soap and hot water. To colour it permanently, use a permanent marker. Make sure you want to do it though because it won't come off once you've done it.
 Decide on the hair style for your doll and carefully use craft scissors to cut it.
 Don't use a curling iron or straightener on her hair because it will burn her hair.
 To add some glitter to her hair, mix some glitter with hair gel in your paper cup and use a cotton ball to put it on her hair. It will make her hair pretty and glittery and you can wash it off later with soap and water.
 Try doing buns, ponytails (or you could even try doing an inverted ponytail, though you have to be careful as her hair will tangle easily), pigtails, braids or any other style you like. To be creative, make your own hair style!
