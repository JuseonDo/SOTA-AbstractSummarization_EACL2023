determine your second vanishing point.

@summary
sketch your main objects drawing the vertical lines perfectly vertical, the horizontal lines moving to the left at an angle towards the left vanishing point and the horizontal lines moving to the right at an angle towards the right vanishing point (all the horizontal lines should converge in one or the other of the vanishing points if extended far enough).

give detail to your drawing respecting the trends given by the horizontal lines sketched for the main objects.

 Sketch a horizontal line for the horizon as in the first method.
 This point may be located below the bottom of the paper (outside the paper.) You don't need to actually mark the point.
 The usual method for this is to sketch a first line from the point of view in a 60 degree angle to the left and mark your vanishing point where this line intersects the horizon.
 For this you will draw a second line from the point of view in a 30 degree angle to the right. Again, the vanishing point will be the intersection of this line and the horizon. The 60 and 30 degree angles can be different, but the angle between the lines that go from the eye of the observer to the vanishing points have to form a 90 degree angle.
, These lines will determine the proportion of the sizes of the objects when they are located closer or farther from the point of view.


Make light, temporary guidelines with a ruler (shown here in green) to make sure your details are in perspective. Erase these guidelines later.
