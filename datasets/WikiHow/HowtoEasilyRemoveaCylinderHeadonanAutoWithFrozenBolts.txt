@summary
use a hacksaw to cut the cross-over exhaust pipe on a v6 or v8.

@summary
make the saw-cut where it will be easily accessible.remove the valve cover and the intake manifold and then unbolt the cylinder head.

@summary
lift both the cylinder head and the exhaust manifold off together.make your repairs and clean the head thoroughly.

@summary
clean engine block surfaces where the gaskets make contact.

@summary
lift and replace the cylinder head as a "unit" after getting your gasket positioned.

@summary
insert the exhaust splice-fitting (usually a 2" x 2" o.d.

@summary
use a ruler or vernier calipers if necessary to confirm the size of the pipe, if you are not sure of the size, as necessary.

@summary
avoid exhaust fumes in your car's cabin.

@summary
listen for a leak as a pipping, snapping or a popping sound or a larger leak may be a "grrr, brrr" (growling) sound.

 This is because the nuts going to the stud bolts in both areas are usually rusted and frozen and cannot be removed without breaking them off, and then extracting the broken stud.

The cross-over pipe usually looks like a "Y" shaped tube which connects the two exhaust manifolds to the exhaust pipe. However, in some older vehicles the crossover curved around the front of the block to the other side, not a Y. Be certain to cut only the arm going to the cylinder head you are removing. Exception: if you're removing both cylinder heads, you'll have to cut both sides loose.

, You will want to plan for clearance for inserting an exhaust splice-connector when doing reassembly.,, This is without having to remove the exhaust manifold from the cylinder head. So you have the portion of the cross-over pipe still attached -- all in one piece without any more cutting.,, This is for a good seal where the head will be reinstalled., Remember to plan for inserting the exhaust splice-connector when doing reassembly without ever removing the exhaust manifold or those frozen bolts between the cross-over pipe and exhaust pipe.

Since the exhaust pipe is usually on a flexible "hanger", you'll have enough "play" to insert connector piece without having to do it before you tighten down the cylinder head.
 connector), and tighten down the 2 U-clamps either before or after the cylinder head is torqued down. It is easy to insert this piece and to make a tight fit., The size may be different in some parts of the exhaust tubes., Check into having it welded later at a muffler shop if it loosens after vibrating and bouncing around for a period of time. Some pipes are stainless steel and are difficult to weld.,

Caution: Fumes are odorless and can be deadly.
