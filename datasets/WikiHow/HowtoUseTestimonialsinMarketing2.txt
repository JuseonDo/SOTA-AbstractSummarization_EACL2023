 Whether you are networking in a social setting or giving a sales pitch, use the testimonials you have gathered to demonstrate why customers love your product or service.



Dedicate a space or a page specifically for testimonials. Rotate the testimonials so that they stay refreshed and people who visit your site often do not see the same ones every time.
Invite people on your site or social networking pages to submit testimonials of their own.
 Whether you have flyers, brochures or postcards, including a few positive endorsements will help you market your business.
 There should be space in any digital, print or televised ads for at least 1 or 2 testimonials.
