@summary
after you find the good thing in yourself or the thing you're good at the most, maybe you should start working on something else.

@summary
go ahead, ask people for their opinion about you.

@summary
plan out things in your mind, what's something you've always hated about yourself?
@article
 Something that you're interested in but never tried for example. Let's say you like ballet but you've never tried it, start taking ballet classes and watching videos about ballet on YouTube.
 Ask them what they find good and bad in you. Maybe you can work on the bad things and become a better person.
 Try on improving it. For example, if you hate your body, work hard on losing those extra pounds. Read other articles on how to do so, or just go to a dietitian.
