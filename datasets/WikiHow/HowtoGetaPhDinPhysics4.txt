once you're accepted and have started grad school: believe it or not, the grades you get in your graduate courses aren't nearly as important as your qualifying exams and research performance.

preparing for the qualifying exam: it's like an advanced physics gre, and you can't prepare enough.

 The qualifying exam is a major hurdle, and determines whether you'll be able to start your Ph.D. research. The sooner you pass the exam, the better - you'll get your pick of thesis advisers if you pass quickly. Programs can vary, but usually the exam is 1/2-1 day long, covers all topics, and should be passed by the end of your primary coursework.
 Ask students who've survived the process how you can do the same.
