, They sell the cheapest weapons. (Including the uber turret and Planet Buster) Buy as much as you can so you don't have to refill for a long time., Aim the missile at the center of a city. Fly around the planet to avoid getting hit. Once you see a flash of light, check your map. The city should be gone. (If the city does not go away, wait for awhile and it should self destruct) Ignore the radar signal and fly to the next planet/system., After it recharges, go to another city and drop the missile. Continue doing this until all cities are demolished.,
