 Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe.If you’re demonstrating this technique to someone, point the toe side of the shoe toward them so they can see your hand movements.
 Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.
 Keep the second knot loose. Notice there is a circle shape formed by the knot. Hold the circle shape with your hand and lay it flat against the shoe.
 Make sure it comes up through the circle and over to one side. You can keep it loose, but make sure it does not slide all the way out of circle.
 It should come up through the circle and over to the other side of the shoe.








You should now have two loops on either side of the knot in the center of the shoe.
 Use your hands to pull the loops tight so they are secure. Now your shoes are tied.
