 You will be spreading the finished muddy buddies across this at the end, so make sure that you have enough room., Save the remaining 1 cup (100 grams) of Golden Graham cereal for later., Save the remaining ½ cup (90 grams) of chocolate chips for later., Keep microwaving and stirring at 30 second intervals until the mixture is smooth. There should be no lumps or clumps., Save the remaining ¾ cup (75 grams) of marshmallows for later., Try to use a rolling motion, where you are bringing the cereal from the bottom of the bowl to the top. This will help distribute the chocolate mixture more evenly., If you don't have a plastic, resealable bag, use a large, plastic container with a lid in stead. You will need to shake the cereal with some powdered sugar, so make sure that whatever container you end up using has enough space for the cereal to move about., The powdered sugar will coat the cereal, and keep it from sticking., When closing the bag, make sure that you leave some air inside it. This will help the cereal move around even more., Try to spread the cereal mixture as evenly and thinly as possible. It will take about 10 to 15 minutes for them to cool., This will great that familiar graham, marshmallow, and chocolate s'mores look., If you have any left over, put them into an airtight container, and store it in the fridge.
