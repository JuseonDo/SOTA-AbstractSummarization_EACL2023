 Planes ARE safe and statistically, they are actually the number 1 safest way to travel! There is a very, very, very low chance of anything happening- a much lower chance than when you drive in a car, even.;
, This will help because you won't have to look down.
 If you feel stressed, then bring along a small squeeze ball or stuffed animal to discretely squeeze. Believe it or not, this will help alleviate tension.
 Sometimes, just the noise of the engines is enough to stir someone up. Audiobooks are also very calming and distracting.
 Watch the movie, read a good book, listen to music, do a craft project or a crossword puzzle- anything to keep you busy.
, Sometimes, the simple act of wearing a cozy hat can relieve mental insecurity and make you feel more at ease.
 Hold this as long as you possibly can and then gently, from head to toe, release all you tension and FULLY relax every muscle in your body as much as you possibly can. Take a few slow sips of water, take a few deep breaths and repeat if necessary. This should help.
 This might include a favorite, small plush animal or maybe a comfort food to indulge yourself in.
 It's hard not to feel stressed when you're too cold or sore from the hard seat. Be sure to bring along a small throw blanket, a pillow, a shawl, slippers, a sweatshirt or whatever will make you comfy while traveling.
 If you try to do these things, you should be fine. Remember, flying makes everyone at least a LITTLE nervous, but, if you follow these techniques, you'll be there before you know it!
