for the tail, just draw a triangle pointing towards the body.
For the dorsal and anal fins, draw lines that would separate them from the body. Simple lines would do just as long as it looks like fins.
For the pelvic fin, just draw a small dome at the fishâ€™s underside.



For the gills, just draw a simple vertical line for the guide, about 1/3 across the body
For the fins, draw pointed butterfly wings-like figures on the side.



Aside from the face you can also add other details like hats, ribbons, bags etc.



The lineart might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.
