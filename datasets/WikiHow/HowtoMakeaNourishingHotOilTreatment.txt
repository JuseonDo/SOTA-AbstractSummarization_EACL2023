 This will cleanse your hair of all residual dirt and oils so you have a clean scalp to start with.;
, Coconut oil nourishes your scalp and hair and makes it shinier and smoother. Olive Oil also has similar properties except it doesn't have the same strengthening properties of coconut oil but it is effective in removing dandruff.
 About 4-5 tbsp would do. The honey is added to make the hot oil more easy to apply. Mix the mixture well till the honey is 'dissolved'.
 Make sure there the container is not filled to the brim otherwise the oil would spill out

, You will be able to tell if the oil has boiled or not by a rapid crackling sound that comes from it.
 Let the crackling sound stop and then remove the container out slowly.
 If not warm yet, let it cool for sometime.
 Use enough oil to coat your hair well. Start from the roots and go all the way to the ends massaging well.
 if you don't have enough time then take a towel that has been tumble dried or heated, wrap it around your head and sit for about 15-20 minutes.
 There is not need to use a conditioner as the hot oil takes its place.
 Use the hot oil treatment once in a week to nourish your hair.
