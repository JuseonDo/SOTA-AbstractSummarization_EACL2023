Memorize the part so well that singing it is second nature. You should be able to sing your entire part a cappella.
Refrain from extensive practice 2 or 3 days before the session.;
,


Go to sleep as early as possible and try to get a good night sleep the night before the recording session. Rest rejuvenates your system and gives you energy.
Sleep in a comfortable position with your head even with your body. A proper sleeping position helps prevent neck or back cramps.
 Keep an air filter in your bedroom to ensure that you breathe clean air while sleeping.



If you are a smoker, minimize the amount of cigarettes you have the day of the recording.
If you are a drinker, refrain from heavy drinking the night before your recording session.
Don't stop smoking suddenly just before a recording session, as doing so may create problems. Excess mucus may accumulate in your throat and nasal passage and may inhibit your ability to sing without a nasally, congested tone.



Don't wear out your vocal cords. Talk as little as possible the day before your recording session. If you need to communicate, consider using a portable marker board.



Room-temperature water soothes the vocal cords and opens up the esophagus. Ginger tea is particularly beneficial for the throat. Drink as much tea as you like to keep your throat relaxed and ready. Adding honey provides a bit of a coating for your throat.
Drink plenty of water prior to and throughout your recording session. Don't drink ice water, as it can tighten the vocal cords.
Refrain from drinking coffee the day of your recording session. The acidic properties in coffee are dehydrating and may have a negative effect on the throat.
, Dairy and gluten can contribute to excess mucus that may cause problems.
 Warm up gradually, loosening up the chest muscles, lungs and vocal cords. Find information on vocal warm-ups online or take lessons from a vocal teacher.
