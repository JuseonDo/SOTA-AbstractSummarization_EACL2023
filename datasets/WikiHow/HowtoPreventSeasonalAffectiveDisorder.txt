 An hour spent outdoors walking in winter sunlight is as effective as 2-1/2 hours of light box therapy. Midday when the sun is at its highest point is thought to be the most effective time to walk during winter months.;
, The effects of daylight are beneficial, even on cloudy days.
, Regular physical activity helps reduce both depression and fatigue. When possible, exercise during the day near sources of light. If possible, find an outdoor sport or hobby that you can enjoy during the winter months to encourage you to spend more time outdoors.
 Social contact and support is very important when suffering from mood disorders.
 Discuss higher doses with your healthcare professional for the time of year when your SAD symptoms are present. Begin the higher doses before the first symptoms appear and continue until you are able to get sufficient daily natural sunlight again.
 Arrange the rooms in your home so that you can maximize your exposure to light while eating, reading, working, or watching television.
, Generally, light therapy consists of sitting for 30 minutes in front of a 10,000-lux light box in early morning to mimic the benefits of natural sunlight. Begin light therapy before symptoms of SAD start.

 Even short vacations with lots of sun can help.
