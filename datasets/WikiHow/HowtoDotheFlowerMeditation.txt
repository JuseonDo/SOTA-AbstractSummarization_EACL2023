 Turn your head and make faces. Then relax.;
, Try to see the flowers as clearly as possible. What color are the flowers? Breathe to the bottom of the feet and think 10 times the mantra "flower."

, Breathe into the individual chakras, visualize flowers there and think "flower."

, Combine all the chakras together. Think the mantra until you see all the flowers or feel them. Which flower type do you see?

, Wrap yourself totally with the light. Think the mantra "light." Let the light flow into your body and fill you with light. Circulate in your body with light and think "Light". Think the mantra so many times, until you are full of light.
 Think the mantra "Light." Move your toes. Meditate on the energy channel (the twine) in the center of the body between the pelvis and the crown chakra.
 Place the light in that chakra, where it wants to be placed. For most people, it is the heart or sacral chakra. Focus on your chakra and thus bring your mind to rest. Stop a minute every thought. Relax.
 Move the hands and feet. Stretch yourself. Sit on. Take your peace with in everyday life.
