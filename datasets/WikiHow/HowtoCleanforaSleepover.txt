 Tidy this area really good, and make sure it has enough room for everyone including you.;
,, Use pet cleaning tape to roll hairs off cushions, carpet, bedding, and other surfaces. Keep them outside or in another room so they will stay out of the way and not knock anything over.


Wipe down all dusty areas twice to remove any potential allergens, and to ensure that it looks neat and tidy.
 Pick up any clothes, papers, books, shoes, and other things from the floor, and put them in their correct places. If you are unsure of where an item goes, then don't be afraid to ask your parents.
 Ensure that there are enough hand towels for guests to use, and put in adequate toilet paper in the toilet paper holder.
 If you know that your toilet has been cleaned recently, and it doesn't look dirty, then this step may not be as necessary as the others.
 Make sure that the smell is not too strong, because some smells can make people nauseous or have a headache if they are too strong.
 This can be done using a sponge, as well as paper towels and glass cleaner to use for the mirror.
 Even if they won't be used, give them a cleaning, as some people may look and notice it if it's really dirty.
 Provide both liquid and solid soap choices, in case someone prefers to use one over the other.
 If guests are sleeping on the floor, then they'll most likely be able to see under beds, tables, chairs, etc., and you don't want them finding dust bunnies, candy wrappers, stinky socks, or other disgusting things.
 Check that all DVDs you plan to watch are clean and unscratched. If the DVD is scratched, or it doesn't work, or has another issue, then alert your parents, and they may be able to fix it. You don't want not being able to watch everyone's favorite movie spoiling the night.
 It's also a good idea to remove fragile objects in case they're bumped into or knocked during the fun of the sleepover.
 The same for pillows and cushions.
