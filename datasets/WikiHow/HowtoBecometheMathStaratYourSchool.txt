 That is a myth. It takes hours of strenuous work to understand math. Math is built on previous knowledge so review and practice. Give yourself practice tests every week and work on solving problems faster.;
, Make flashcards for formulas and vocabulary.
 Understanding basic Algebra is a must! Review all your old tests to find your mistakes.
 Plow through the problems until you understand them perfectly.
 If they can't afford it, find the smartest kid in math and ask him or her to help you. Also talk to your teacher or try to find a good study partner if you need it.
, There are always different ways to solve math problems.
 Go to the teacher or tutor and review it. This is very important! If you are getting lower math grades for being careless, try to understand how you can change that pattern and be more careful. Make sure to double check your answers every time.
 If you don't like your math teacher and there is another math teacher that you do want, talk to the school and get your parents involved if possible.
 Take baby steps and start to improve slowly because this will build confidence and make you want to succeed.
 Try to be prepared for any surprise tests by listening to your math teacher. If he or she tells the class to review a portion of the textbook carefully than beware a pop quiz could be brewing. During a test always start with the easy problems first and carefully look over the problems before diving in.
