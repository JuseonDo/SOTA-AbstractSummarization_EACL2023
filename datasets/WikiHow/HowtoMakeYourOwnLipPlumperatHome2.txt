 You can even use petroleum jelly in a pinch. Coconut oil or shea butter will be better for you, because they are moisturizing., Both essential oils are great at plumping up those lips. They do this by naturally stimulating the blood vessels.Cinnamon essential oil can irritate the skin. Consider mixing a drop with some of your coconut oil or shea butter, and dabbing it onto your inner elbow. If it doesn't irritate you, then you're good to go.
 If you don't have a toothpick, you can use another small mixing tool, such as a chopstick., You can also use one of those containers meant for storing excess paint from the craft store. Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is clean and dry., Your lip balm is now ready to use! If you'd like, you can decorate the lid with a pretty label or a cute sticker.
