 Give your caterpillar a nice bright smile while you're at it, and maybe a leaf or two to munch.;
, Include lots of color and try to make the wings as symmetrical as possible.
 The point of view can be from the front or the side, so long as you get the angle of the back legs right.
 Color it a darker brown on the outline and a lighter brown on its stomach, like so.
 Your picture could be of a domestic rabbit, shown above, or a rabbit like Bugs or the Easter Bunny. It's up to you!

, You can try your hand at a cartoon turtle, a realistic turtle, or even a snapping turtleâ€”draw them all if you want!

, This one is a little complicated, but you should end up sketching a cute baby monkey with big eyes and a long tail.
 The more realistic your cow is, the more of a challenge it will be to draw it, but you shouldn't have much trouble so long as your proportions are correct.
 If you'd prefer a fish you could keep in your home, try drawing a goldfish instead.
 Make sure to shade it darker on the bottom!
