 Check online shoelace websites for a great variety of cordage materials.;
, The long lace is folded in half, and the cut lace is in the middle.
 Baste the neck of the loop (still with the cut lace in the middle).
 Go back and forth many times until the width of the many stitches is 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm). Snip off the end of the cut cord in the loop and lightly burn the end you just cut with a lighter to keep it from fraying.
, Then baste all the cords together very snugly.
 This end will be thicker so decrease the presser foot setting. After sewing, snip off the ends and burn the ends with a lighter.
 Use a belt snap on one end and a split ring to your wallet. Make sure the contents of your wallet do not fall out when hanging from the leash by attaching the leash to the center of the wallet.
