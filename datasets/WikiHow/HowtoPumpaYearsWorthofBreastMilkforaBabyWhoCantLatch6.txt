once you've got a long-term pumping routine, make a goal for getting out of it!,

keep a running tally of your supply on hand.

when each shoebox fills up, store it at the bottom of the freezer.

@summary
while you are pumping, don't try to use thawed milk before it gets too "old.",

@summary
don't offer frozen milk until you've stopped pumping fresh, with these exceptions:

@summary
first, if you run out of fresh milk or something is wrong with your supply, thawed breast milk is much better than formula.

@summary
once your freezer is full, space your pumping even further apart.

, If you are pumping 40 oz. a day, you will make an extra day's supply in 2-4 days. That means that you could quit when your child is eight months old and still have enough milk to feed him/her until she is old enough for cow's milk. Wet nurses often fed six babies, so it is probable that a dedicated woman whose baby had a small appetite could lay in a year's supply in two months.
 It will be easy to remember to do this! You can use a notebook stored near your breast pump.
 This means that it will be hard to rotate stock but also that the bags that need to last the longest will be kept the coldest. Weigh the box, subtract 8 oz., and add that figure to your running tally of supply on hand.
 Milk placed at the bottom of a chest freezer when your child is one week old will be safe there on his/her first birthday. You may have heard that breast milk adjusts perfectly for a child's age, but this is only true for the first few weeks. After that, you have what is called "mature milk," which varies more with your diet than your baby's age. Fresh milk is slightly better quality, which is more important when your baby is young.

Second, you may want to offer thawed milk once in a while to make sure your baby stays accustomed to the taste.
Finally, if you come close to running out of freezer space, you can start thawing the oldest milk to supplement your fresh supply, and freezing only enough to replace it. What you're doing here is making your younger baby deal with slightly degraded frozen milk so that your older baby gets slightly higher quality. You may just want to leave your freezer full of the old milk and stop pumping when you think you have enough to last out the year.
 Many women continue to produce milk nursing just once a day. Nonetheless, you'll want to continue increasing your intervals slowly. If your supply drop below your baby's appetite, you'll have the best chance to correct the problem if you haven't made big changes.
