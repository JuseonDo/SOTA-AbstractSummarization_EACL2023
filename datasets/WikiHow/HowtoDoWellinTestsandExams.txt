 Continue until you return really good results.

, Make sure it is the right answer. If you are not sure of an answer, skip it and come back to it. Chances are it might be addressed in a different question, so keep your eyes open for more clues on the same topic as you complete the rest of the test.
 If you think what you have written is right, leave it be and get on with your next sets of revision knowing that you did your best. Only your actual test results will confirm how well you have done.
 Do this when in a calm state so silly mistakes can be fixed.Also, try and always be motivated as it will help you do better..
