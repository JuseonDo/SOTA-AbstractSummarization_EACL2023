, Spread the milk solids over the area of the fabric doll with the marker stains., The marker ink will seep up into the milk solids.

If the milk solids have no ink, repeat. It can mean that they have not been left to sit on the fabric long enough.
 Knot it to keep the doll inside, then put through a regular medium-warm wash in the washing machine.,
