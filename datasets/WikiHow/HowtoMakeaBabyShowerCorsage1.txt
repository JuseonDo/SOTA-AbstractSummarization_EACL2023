 Alternatively, you can choose white flowers so that the corsage remains neutral. The design can be used to create either a lapel or a wrist corsage after the greenery and ribbon are attached.
 If you choose fresh flowers, then be sure to make the corsage within 24 hours of the shower. A silk flower corsage can be made well in advance.


If you want fresh flowers, check and see what blooms are in season in your area. Blooms that are in season are easier to find and are often much more affordable., You can choose one large bloom, three medium blooms, or five small blooms.
 For instance, choose daisies in one color or a variety of different colored daisies.. Leave about a 3” (8 cm) stem on each bloom.
 Poke florist’s wire into the base of the blooms. Then, wrap the wire loosely around the length of the stems. For a 3” (8 cm) stem, your wire should go around about seven to nine times.


Cut the wire. Wrap the wired stem with florist’s tape. Florist wire can be difficult to cut through, so use proper wire cutters for safety.
 This will protect the blooms and hide the wire., You want to bend them at a 90° angle right at the base of the flower. The flower should face forward instead of upward.



When twisting the wire, pinch and twist the wire together to make it as compact (not bumpy) as possible.
