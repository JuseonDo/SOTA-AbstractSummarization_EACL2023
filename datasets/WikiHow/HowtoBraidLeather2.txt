repeat steps 3-11 until you have used the desired amount of leather.since this process is very detail-oriented, it is suggested that you start with shorter length strands.

tie the end of the braid once you have finished.
@article
 Leave a little more length at the end of the strands as this technique will utilize more leather.


Remember that you are using 4 strands now, so the braid will be considerably thicker than the previous methods. Think about cutting the width slightly thinner than before.
Using 4 strands will also form a round braid rather than a flat one, hence its name.
 For the following steps, the 4 strands will be referred to as A, B, C, and D from left to right.









Since you will be working with many strands, try tying the ends to a key-chain ring and putting the ring under the leg of a chair. This will keep the strands secure so you can focus all of your attention on this slightly intricate process.
To help you keep track of each strand, consider practicing with colored yarn first. It can become very easy to lose track of which strand is which. Alternately, you could tie-off different colored strings of yarn to the end of each strand.
, Your order will now be A, B, D, C.
, Your strands should now be B, A, D, C.









If you've done the previous steps correctly, strands D and A should be in the middle, respectively. Strand B should be on the far left side and strand C should be on the far right.
 Pull the two strands in each hand away from each other to tighten the braid.
,,, From left to right, strands should be ordered normally: A, B, C, D. You have completed 1 cycle of the braiding process.









Tighten the braids in the same manner as you did in step 7. You will need to do this after each braiding cycle to ensure that your braid is tight and won't come apart.
, You might tie the remaining loose strands to another key-chain ring, similar to the top end. This is an easy way to adjoin the opposite ends to make a bracelet or necklace.
