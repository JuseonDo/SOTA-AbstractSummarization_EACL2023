 Although you shouldn’t over-shampoo your hair, condition it whenever possible. Conditioner doesn’t strip dirt away from hair, like shampoo does, but adds in the moisture and reduces cuticle swelling.Invest in a high-quality conditioner if you suffer from dry hair. The few extra dollars will give you a product that goes the extra distance for your hair.;
, Leave-in conditioner comes either in cream or in spray-bottle form; use whichever method feels better on your hair. Towel-dry your hair until it’s partially dry, then apply leave-in conditioner and allow your hair to air-dry the rest of the way.


Leave-in conditioners come in a wide range of prices, and can be found in any grocer or convenience store.As with any product, investing more money will yield better results.

 Many natural oils are a great source of nutrition and moisture for hair. If store-bought chemicals make you nervous, use natural oils instead.

, While the lather might make you feel like you’re getting clean, the sulphates actually strips your hair of important natural oils. Low-sulphate and sulphate-free shampoos will get your hair just as clean, though you’ll have to get used to lather-less showers.


Low-sulphate shampoos are available at most grocery stores.
If not, check your local beauty supply store or salon.



Dissolve one tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of water until it dissolves, and use that to wash your hair in the shower.Baking soda alone will dry out your hair, so always follow it up with apple cider vinegar, which is a natural moisturizer.Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water, and pour it over your hair after the baking soda mixture has been rinsed from your hair.
Rinse all mixtures from your hair.
