 You'll need a car stereo that supports Bluetooth devices and audio. Many newer stereos do this, but if you have an older car you may need to install a new stereo first or use one of the other methods in this article.


Your car stereo must support the A2DP Bluetooth profile in order to play back music from your iPad.
If your stereo has an auxiliary jack but no Bluetooth support, you can use a Bluetooth dongle that connects to the auxiliary jack.;
,,, This process will vary significantly depending on the stereo brand and car manufacturer.
 Even though you are connecting your iPad, select the "Phone" option.
 This will make the stereo begin searching for your iPad's Bluetooth signal.
 It should appear in the list of available devices.
 This is usually 0000.
 This may take a few moments. You should see a message on your car stereo informing you that the connection has been made.
 Now that your iPad is connected, you can start playing music on your car stereo. You will need to switch to the AUX or Bluetooth input.
