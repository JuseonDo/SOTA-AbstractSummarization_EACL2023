@summary
calculate the areas of the individual shapes you divided out, making sure you use the same unit of measurement with all of them, and then add them together.

@summary
convert square feet into square yards by dividing by 9 if you live in the united states.

@summary
round your number up if you feel any doubt because it would be better to have extra scraps to use in closets and on stairs than to come up short.

, If your room is a simple rectangle already, then you do not have to worry about this.
, Or you may just calculate the area of your simply shaped room.


Multiply the length measurement by the width measurement to find the area of a rectangle or square.
Multiply the length measurement by the width measurement and divide by 2 to find the area of a rectangle.
 Carpet rolls come in square meters if you live outside the United States.
, Use this information added to your area calculations to help you know how much carpet you will need.


Divide the length of the room that the seams will run perpendicular to by the width of the carpet roll you have chosen. This will give you the number of times the roll will need to be cut, moved over and unrolled again.
Multiply the length of the wall parallel to the strips of carpet by the number of strips of carpet that will be across the room. This will give you the length of 1 long carpet roll. Divide this number by the length of the carpet rolls you have chosen to find out how many carpet rolls you will need. If there is a remainder, then you will need an extra roll.
