 Make sure your shirts are long enough to adequately cover your stomach and hips.;
, It is best if these layers are easily removable, too.


Don't put on too many layers that you won't be able to freely move your arms around! Sometimes only two or three layers is sufficient, depending on how cold-resistant you are. Often a thick sweater over a T-shirt or two is good enough for added warmth.
 This can be optional if you a pair of thick snow pants to put on that is cold resistant to -30 C, like those WorkKing or Carhartt type snow pants or overalls.
 Your legs are more prone to get chilled and frozen than your upper body, even if you are moving them around a lot.
 Ideally, a nice thick scarf should be worn underneath your coat as an extra layer of protection at the neck. It should not let any air in from your chin to the your chest.


Depending on the wind chill outside, you can wear your scarf so that it just covers your neck, or so that it acts as a face protection as well as covering for your neck.
 Down or a synthetic replacement is optimal, but if your coat is quilted, thick, and closes at the wrists, waists and neck, you'll be fine.


Make sure the coat is tested for winter, not for cooler days like late fall or early winter.
 Gloves are obviously best if you'll be taking part in an activity where your dexterity is important--driving or snowball fights, for example. Either tuck your gloves into your sleeves, or pull them tight over the sleeves, but do not let any room for air or snow to get it in.
 Cover with a pair of high, waterproof, insulated winter boots.



The hat you wear should be one that will not let the cold or wind through to your head very easily. .
