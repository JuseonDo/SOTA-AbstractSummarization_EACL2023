 Decide whether you want a big bash with a bartender, catered food and a DJ, or if you'd rather have a more casual evening with friends--or something in between. Consult several party books and decide on a budget before making up your mind.;
, It's often best to schedule a Christmas party several weeks before Christmas--before calendars are filled with other activities, shopping and baking.
 Ask as many people as you can accommodate to a sit-down dinner, or as many people as your house will hold for a cordial get-together with finger foods and drinks.
 If you are having the meal catered, consult with the caterer and choose a menu, or plan your own.
 Invitations should go out as early in December as possible so that your guests can schedule the party and RSVP. Be sure to include times, let guests know if a meal will be served, and mention appropriate dress.
 Your d√©cor should include the traditional Christmas tree, plus lots of candles, centerpieces (if appropriate) and other holiday decorations.
,, Relax and don't worry too much if people are enjoying themselves.
