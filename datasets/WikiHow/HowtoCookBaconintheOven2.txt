 Sprinkle leftover sugar over the top of the bacon.
 Take a second baking pan and lay it on top of the bacon. This will flatten the bacon flat as it cooks.


If you don't have a second baking sheet that fits snugly into the first one, use another oven-safe pan or two.

If you don't have aluminum foil, parchment paper will also work.
 Check the progress of the bacon by lifting the aluminum foil or parchment paper.
