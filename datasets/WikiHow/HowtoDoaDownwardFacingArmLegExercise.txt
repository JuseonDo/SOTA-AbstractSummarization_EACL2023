 You should probably be using a carpet, mattress, or something else that's fairly soft. Place a washcloth or folded pillowcase under your head so your face is not directly touching it, however.;
, Keep all your other appendages relaxed as you do this for 5 seconds (or longer if you like).
 This time you should be relaxing the arm and leg you stretched initially. Remember not to lift any part of your body off the ground--pretend like you're moving on ice and you want your weight distributed evenly.
, For faster results, increase the number of sets/times per week you do this exercise.
