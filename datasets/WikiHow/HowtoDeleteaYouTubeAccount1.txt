 Visit google.com/account in a browser. Google has linked every YouTube account with a Google+ account. The only way to delete your YouTube account is to delete the Google+ profile associated with it.


Deleting your Google+ account will not affect other Google products such as Gmail or Drive. Your emails and stored files will not be deleted. All photos uploaded to Google+ will still be accessible via Picasa.
You will not lose your contacts, though they will no longer be organized by Circles.
You will not lose any Google+ pages you own or manage.
You will lose access to your Google+ profile and all of your +1s.;
,,,, Your Google+ profile will be deleted, which means your YouTube channel will be deleted as well.


Your comments and messages will be permanently deleted.
