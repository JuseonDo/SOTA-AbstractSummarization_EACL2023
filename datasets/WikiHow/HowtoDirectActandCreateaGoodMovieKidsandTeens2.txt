@summary
call the people you want in your movie and plan a day when they can all come.

@summary
put friends or willing musicians behind the scene if you'd like; it can sound clearer, sharper, and crisper that way.

 If you have a lot of people in your movie it might be hard to choose a day when you can all meet. Make a schedule of how much time you are spending in a scene and what people you are needing, because if someone doesn't act one day it's silly that he comes (unless he has to do something else, such as being the camera man).
 Otherwise, you could record music that you created, upload it onto your computer, and then paste it into your movie, or just search for music/sound on the program you're using.
