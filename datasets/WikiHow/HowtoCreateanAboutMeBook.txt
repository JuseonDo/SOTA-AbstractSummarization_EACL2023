 Something to put all your stuff in. Find something that suits your needs. Scrapbooks are expensive though, so maybe a notebook or duo-tang is more in your price range.;
, Put your name and use stickers and photos and felts - whatever you like. You can even use letters & pictures from magazines!

, Example: name, address, second name, phone number, birthday, people born on your birthday, mother and father, siblings, favorite teacher etc.
, This way, friends & family can write sweet and funny messages for you to enjoy!

, Use it like a scrapbook!

, Have it describe your personality, your life, or just a funny quote you enjoy. If you and your friend(s) say lots of random/funny things, include a page just for quotes; it'll be well worth remembering them down the track! Write each person's quote in their favorite color, maybe in a fancy font.
 If you like a band, make a place for that band. If you like a book, make a place for that book.
 Add a picture of the person that sings it, if you'd like.
