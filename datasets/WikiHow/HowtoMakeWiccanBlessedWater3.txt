 Rain, Spring or purified is preferred. Tap water will work, many chose more 'natural' sources.
 Be sure it's in an area where it will catch the sun's rays.
 As with the Lunar Water, we do not want to have two different energies touching the water. It is to be charged with one.
 Use in healings and solar rituals.
