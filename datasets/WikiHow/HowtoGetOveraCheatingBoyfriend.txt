@article
 Text messaging, by letter, email, or over the phone breakups never are clear. Be absolutely sure he is cheating on you. Tell him what you feel. Talk it out, no matter how long it takes. There is no other way you can develop a sense of closure.;
, They aren't worthy of your time, energy, or thoughts. They cheated because they weren't secure enough in themselves.
 Do something for the first time. Distract yourself from the pain. It will hurt for a while, but it does not need to consume you.
 Treat yourself to a spa or getaway, or pamper yourself at home. Eat some of your favorite chocolate. Get a manicure. Whatever makes you feel better.
 Look back on any warning signs or red flags that you ignored that would show he was cheating. Vow to not be fooled again and to look more carefully for a guy who cares enough to be faithful.
 Just because one boyfriend cheated on you doesn't mean they all will.
,,,, If he sees you, he will very much regret cheating on you and feel that he was a fool to do that
