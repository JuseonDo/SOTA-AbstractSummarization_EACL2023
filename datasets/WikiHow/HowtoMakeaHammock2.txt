Lengthen the measurements if tall people will be using the hammock. Bear in mind that 15cm/6 inches will be lost from making the hammock.
 Sew a seam.
 Press into place. Repeat one more time and press in place. Then sew the pressed ends together, using at least two or three rows of stitching. Keep the stitches at least 2.5cm/1 inch from the end, to leave space for the grommets.
 These mark the grommet placement.


Use an invisible fabric marker or tailor's chalk.
, Cut it into 10 smaller ropes, each 2.7 meters/9 feet long.
 The most typical macrame braid is the clew knot:


Fold the cords in half.
Mount the folded cords to the ring with a larks head knot.
Slip the ring over an upturned milkshake cup or secure to the work surface in some other way.
Spread the cords out and straighten them.
Number the ends of the cords 1 through 20.
Weave the clew knot using all of the cords - see How to weave a clew knot for precise details.
 Use the instructions in How to make a clew knot to get it correct. When adding the ropes, use a strong knot, such as a bowline knot. Pull taut to tighten and test the strength of the hammock.
 Tie tightly. Test for weight suitability before lying in it.
