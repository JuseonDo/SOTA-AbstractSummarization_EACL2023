 Do not eat beans alone. In a sandwich, use whole wheat bread or a multi-grain bread with a minimal amount of processed flour; the same goes with tortillas - use whole wheat tortillas. Potatoes and beans is the best combination for maximum digestion of beans
, Scrub the carrots, but do not peel off the skin. The outer layer of carrots have the most nutrition and fiber.  To match the texture of carrots to beans, cook the carrots slightly either separately or together with the beans., Break the banana chips into little pieces and if using dried bananas, chop them in little pieces. Add a tiny bit of water to the mixture, and give the banana chips some time to soften.  Bananas, more than carrots, go through your system slowly., Instead of pinto beans, use a potato masher and try other beans., Then re-heat them to prolong usability.
