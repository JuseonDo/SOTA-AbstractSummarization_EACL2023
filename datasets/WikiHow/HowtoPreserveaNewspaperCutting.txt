,, The dish should be large enough to allow the newspaper cutting to sit flat without folding, bending, or creasing.
 Leave for one hour.
 Carefully pick up the cutting with tongs or something similar and pat dry between two sides of a clean towel.
 Laying it on a wire cooling rack is a good drying spot.


Do not touch the cutting until it is completely dry.
