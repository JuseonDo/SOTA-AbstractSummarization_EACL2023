 Fresh eggs are the best, so if you have access to organic or free range eggs, use those.;
, You will need about 6.7 oz. (200 ml) for the 3 eggs.


Use an oil that you have used for dressings or marinades before, and you know you like. Each olive oil has a different flavor and that flavor can come out in the mayonnaise. Many chefs recommend extra virgin olive oil for the best taste.
 You want to use fresh lemon juice for a mayonnaise, nothing artificial or squeezed from a bottle.
 Sea salt is best if you have it, and freshly ground pepper will also provide your mayonnaise with a pleasing taste.
 While whisking it by hand takes more time and a little muscle, it can often provide better results. Electric mixers can put extra heat into the mayonnaise, which can cause the oil and the eggs to separate.
 This will keep the bowl from moving while you whisk. If you are going to use an electric mixer or blender, place it on a flat surface.
 Gently crack the egg open and allow the the runny egg white to run out of the shell while you transfer the yellow yolk to your hand or the other side of the shell when you open it. If you place the yolk in your hand, the egg white will run through your fingers.
 Once all of the yolks are combined, add 1 tsp (4.5 ml) of water to the eggs and continue to beat. The water will help the emulsion process as the oil is added.
 It is important to go slowly, or the oil will separate and not combine with the yolks.


Incorporate each drop of olive oil completely before you add another drop. If you are using a blender or a mixer, keep it running through the whole process.
 You do not want to see the oil moving to the side of the bowl or forming large drops on the surface of the eggs.
 You do not have to do one drop at a time at this point, but you do need to proceed very slowly.
 The full half lemon will give the mayonnaise a sharp taste, so use less juice if you want a smoother mayonnaise.
 Taste the mayonnaise and season it to taste.
