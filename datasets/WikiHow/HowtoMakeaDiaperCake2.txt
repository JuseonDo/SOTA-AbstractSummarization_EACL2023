 The roll of paper towels will be the centerpiece of the cake that will hold the layers together.You can also used a rolled up blanket or a large bottle of baby lotion as the centerpiece. However, a roll of paper towels will be the easiest centerpiece to work with.
 Place one diaper so that it is lying horizontally along the roll of paper towels.
 Repeat this process so that you form overlapping layers of diapers around the paper towels. You can make this bottom layer as large or as small as you want, just keep in mind that this is the base layer so the other two layers will get progressively smaller than this one., If you have someone to help you do this, it will be easier. Hold the diapers in place around the paper towel roll. Have your helper slip the rubber band over the diapers so that they are secured against the roll.
 The layers should get progressively smaller than the base, with the top layer being smallest. Secure each layer with a large rubber band.
