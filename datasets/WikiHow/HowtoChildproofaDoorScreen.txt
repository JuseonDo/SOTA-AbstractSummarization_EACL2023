, Leave an inch or two (a few centimeters) of overlap., Here is where things get interesting. The typical screen insert uses one big length of spline that runs all around the frame. For this project, cut four separate pieces of rubber spline, equal in length to the four frame sides., Use the convex end of the spline tool to press it into the frame groove., Squeeze a drop of hot glue into the groove, and use the spline tool (the concave end) to press the spline down into the groove., Continue adding more glue every few inches (or centimeters), until you reach until the end of the frame side. The spline may be longer than you expected, so be prepared to trim it. If you use the utility knife, try to avoid accidentally slicing your new screen; scissors work better., The spline should be encased in glue.,,, A beautiful screen insert, ready to go back in the door. And hopefully stay there a while., Here's what the screen looks like when you remove it (pliers are necessary). The one pictured here lasted three years against a cat and two toddlers. You can reuse the spline pieces again when remaking a new screen.
