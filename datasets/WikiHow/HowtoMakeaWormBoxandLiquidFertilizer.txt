@summary
mount the mister above the ice chest and turn it on.

@summary
obtain a small cheap sump pump with a float switch ( try to buy one on craigslist for 10 bucks), maybe $50 new.

by the time the water gets to the plants it's lost some or all of it's chlorine and picked up lots of micro nutrients and micro biotic life which is good for plants.

@summary
keep putting dirty salad in the ice chest, fill it up.

 Elevate it on a sturdy table, retaining wall, stump or old car etc. You will be able to move it, but in 6 months it will weigh 75 lbs or more. Better to find a permanent spot for it now.;
, Find some old hose or situate it so that the water drains into a garbage can (medium to large). Every thing from now on will get plugged up unless you filter your tea. Use some old plastic dish washing things inside the ice chest, stacked around the hole. Use your imagination not your money. Get jiggy with it... a piece of pipe with some screen around it, old swamp cooler pad etc.
 You want only red wigglers (Red Worms).
 Think dirty nasty salad.
 Make sure it has the little filter on the back. Hook it to your hose (drill and tap a hose cap), figure it out it may cost a little. Better to think than to buy.
 You're making compost tea. not too exciting yet and what to do with it. For a while just bucket it out to the garden. Too much work.
 Plumb a hose to it and put the end where you want to water. When the garbage can fills up, the pump pumps. Move the hose occasionally.
 That's the point.
 When it goes down put some more in. Keep it full to the top. In six months it will sink 2 inches (5.1 cm) a day!. The worms will eat all the lawn clippings easily.
