 If you create it on a bumpy surface, the tiger might look bumpy or some parts smaller than the other, for example, the head is bumpy or one leg is bigger than the other. A flat space will help you make your clay tiger comfortably.;
, Roll it into a ball. Shape it into a rectangular prism. Round the edges to help it look like a tiger's body.
 This will be the head. Stick the head at the end of the body with a toothpick.


To stick the head on, break a toothpick in half. Poke one of the halves of the toothpick in the place you're going to put the head. Stick the head onto the toothpick. Don't let any of the toothpick show up at the bottom, and make sure the toothpick doesn't stick out. The toothpick will help the head stay and not fall off.
 Poke small holes in them.
 You will see a mouth form.
 Flatten them, but keep them a little thick. Stick them on top of the head, one on the left, one on the right.
 Stick them on the front of the ears. These will show the inside of the ear.
 Stick them on the (not all the way on the top) top.
 Shape a ball of clay into a triangle and stick it in the high middle of the snout (where the muzzle and mouth are).
 Stick them to the front sides of the body.
 If you'd like, you can add pads and/or claws.
 Bend the ends to create paws. Stick the legs to the back sides of the body.
 Roll a black oval of clay and stick it at the end of the orange strip. Stick it where the bottom will be.
 Stick them everywhere (not all over, or the tiger will be messy!) for stripes.
