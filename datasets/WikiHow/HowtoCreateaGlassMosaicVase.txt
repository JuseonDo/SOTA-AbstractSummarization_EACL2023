, Another option would be to use coloured glass, which gives a colourful effect to the final result.


Optionally you can get a rag or towel, place the tile underneath the rag and hit it with a hammer.
Cut with the tile nippers to fit together. Fitting tiles together is similar to puzzle-making. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to make a design or a pattern to stick the tiles.
 Make sure tiles are placed 1/8" to 1/16" apart. This gives the vase a more finished look.
 The amount of time the glue takes to dry depends on the type you're using.
,, You will completely cover the design to fill the spaces between the glass tiles.
 It will be a process of rinsing the sponge, wringing it out to get as much water as possible out of the sponge, and then wiping the grout some more.


Continue doing this until the glass is clean. It is VERY important that you keep the sponge flat so as not to pull the grout from between the spaces.
, Using these, you can buff the vase so it shines. Done!
