 For this A-line skirt, cotton, light fabrics work well.;
,, Add 4 inches (10.2 cm) onto the length measurement you just took. Cut your rectangle width to approximately 45 inches (114.3 cm) wide.


For example, your rectangles may be 45 inches (114.3 cm) wide and 25 inches (63.5 cm) long.
 Your length should be 45 inches (114.3 cm) wide and your width should be approximately 7 inches (17.8 cm) for a 3 inch (7.6 cm) waist band.


If you want a smaller waist band, double the waist band you would like and add 1 inch (2.5 cm). For example, if you want a 2 inch (5 cm) waist band, you will want a 5 inch (12.7 cm) width.
 Continue to gather it until it is half of your waist size. Pin it into place.
 Turn the edges of your waistband down 1/2 inch (1.3 cm). Iron them in place along the 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) line.
 Iron it in place.
 Cut a strip of 3 inch (7.6 cm) elastic to that is 45 inches (114.3 cm) long.
 Place the piece of interfacing above the 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) fold. Place the piece of elastic to the right of the interfacing above the 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) fold.
 Pin the interfacing and elastic to the body of the fabric, so that it stays in place when you sew.
, Stop when you get to the elastic, because it will stop it from stretching. The interfacing will go on the back of the skirt.
 Place it underneath the 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) fold and sew it into place with a straight stitch through the gatherings. Make sure you do not sew into the elastic.


The elastic will come out of the end of the side of the waist band until you size it according to your waist.
 Gather it so that it fits the remaining size of your waist band. The gather at the back will be larger than the gathered length at the front, giving you plenty of room to stretch.
 Pin it into place. Sew it to the back and bottom of the waist band using a straight stitch.
 Stretch the overflowing elastic to where it feels comfortable. Make sure to allow some extra stretch for your belly to grow.
 Cut the excess elastic and tuck it into the other open end of the waist band.
,, Pin the fabric in and turn the skirt inside out. Sew the seams inward with a straight stitch.
, Sew the hem with a straight stitch.
