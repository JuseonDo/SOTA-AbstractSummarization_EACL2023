@article
 Remove all debris, break off any loose pieces of concrete and fill any cracks with caulk.;
, These will act as a frame to keep in the new concrete. Ideally, the frame should be as high as the new level of concrete.


Add rocks or other large weights against the outside of the planks so that the frame doesn't move under pressure from the concrete.
Choose an appropriate concrete mix for your project. If you only want to add a thin layer of concrete, be sure to choose a mix that doesn't have large rocks. If you want to add a significant amount of concrete, a coarser mix might be the best choice.

This thinner concrete mix serves as a paste to make the adhesion of the new concrete mix to the old concrete easier and to avoid cracking. Only a very thin layer is necessary and can be applied with a brush.
 Even with a trowel as you go along. Pour concrete slowly and evenly using less concrete than you think you might need.
