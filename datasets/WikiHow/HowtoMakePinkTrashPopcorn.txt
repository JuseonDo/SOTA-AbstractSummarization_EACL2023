 Follow the directions listed on your microwaveable popcorn bag.


Be sure to listen to the crackles. Continuing to heat the bag when there is no noise, will result in burnt popcorn.;
, Pick out and discard any unpopped kernels.
, Heat them in the microwave using a 30% to 50% power for about two minutes, or until melted completely. Stir every 30 seconds to incorporate.


If the mixture becomes clumpy and hard-like, after two minutes of heating and stirring, add a spoon of shortening. Whisk it into the candy melt mixture to thin it out.
 Place the cookies in a large freezer zip-bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into small pieces.
 Sift everything together.
 Ensure everything is coated evenly.
 Spread the mixture out evenly.
 Set the sheet aside until the popcorn is cooled.
