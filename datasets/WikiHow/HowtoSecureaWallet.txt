 About two feet long at most is enough â€“ you don't want it to be so long you look like a teen gangster! Also make sure it is strong when pulled.;
, You might need to punch a hole to make a space for it but it's best if you don't need to do this. Alternatively, put it on a round ring that can be attached to your belt or pants, and then secure it.
 Some wallets even come with the whole chain thing included. If you can't punch a hole yourself, ask your local shoe repairer to make a small, neat hole for you.
