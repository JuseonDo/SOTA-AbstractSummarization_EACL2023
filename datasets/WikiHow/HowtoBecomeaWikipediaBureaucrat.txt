 Only registered users can become bureaucrats.;
, Make your contributions in a variety of areas such as editing articles, creating articles, participating in site discussions, and reverting vandalism.
 You're not actually required to be an administrator to become a bureaucrat, but the community will look more favorably of you if you're an administrator. You're likely to fail your nomination if you're not an administrator (and in the most likely case, your nomination will be ended early through the site's snowball clause and/or "not now" clause).
 When you first start, it's a good idea to read the site's new admin school page to understand the privileges that administrators have and how to use them correctly. While you're an administrator, you should be active in a variety of administrative tasks such as deleting bad pages, blocking users, and participating in administrator discussions. You should be active in the administrators' noticeboard.
 Being a bureaucrat is hard work, and takes more time than being an administrator. Read the site's page on bureaucrats to see if being a bureaucrat is for you. If you make a nomination for bureaucrat when you don't really want it, you're likely to fail your nomination.
 See why people succeed and why they fail and make note of what you observe.
 Click on "Nominate yourself" when you're done.
 After the description, sign your nomination with four tildes (~). Click on "Save Page" when you're done.
 Click on "Save Page" when you're done.
 If there are no other nominations, replace the template that says this instead. Replace the "adminship" with "bureaucratship" and "USERNAME" with your username. Click on "Save Page" when you're done.
 Answer any questions that other users give you, and participate in discussions on the page. After seven days of discussion, if you have enough support from other users, you'll become a bureaucrat.
