 For example, in the Grateful Dead song “Casey Jones” the lyrics go: “Trouble ahead, trouble behind / and you know that notion just crossed my mind.” The words “behind” and “mind” constitute an end rhyme., These occur when two words share just a vowel sound (such as hand and span), or just a consonant sound (such as prank and sink). For example, the Grateful Dead song “Friend of the Devil” uses a “slant rhyme” like this, “I set out running but I take my time / A friend of the devil is a friend of mine.” “Time” and “mine” share only a vowel sound., This also occurs with the Grateful Dead song “Casey Jones” in the line “Driving that train, high on cocaine / Casey Jones you better watch your speed.”, Examples of this include “notion” and “ocean,” or “double” and “trouble.” This occurs in The Beatles’ song “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”: “I don't know how you were diverted / You were perverted too / I don't know how you were inverted / No one alerted you.”, These are sometimes called “historical rhymes,” because at one time these words likely had the same pronunciation. The Trogg’s use this rhyme in the song “Wild Things” when they say, “Wild Thing, I think I love you,” and then later, “Wild Things, I think you move me.”
