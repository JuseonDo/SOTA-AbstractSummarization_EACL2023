 Then, peel the eggshell off the cooled eggs.


To peel, gently knock each egg against the side of a bowl or something similar to create cracks. Use your fingers to pry open a small hole, then peel off the eggshell in pieces.
, Add the garlic cloves and heat gently for ten minutes. Towards the end, bring to a boil.
 Let cool completely.

 Place in the refrigerator. Allow to steep for at least one week before consuming.
