 At its most basic level, unit planning ensures you are linking each lesson plan to the next. As you develop a unit plan you'll support key concepts and learning goals with a carefully mapped structure.


Use unit planning to weave key concepts and learning goals together over time and between or among disciplines.
Consider overlapping lessons with fellow instructors to provide longer spans of time for study and practice.;
, You may use unit plans within your specific course. Unit plans are also an excellent way to forge interdisciplinary connections. Developing a multi-lesson unit structure provides you with a framework for presenting overarching themes in a variety of ways. Students with diverse learning styles will benefit, and you will be able to explore different ways of teaching without veering off course or running short on time., Planning out several units over the course of a term, or even the entire year, will help you recognize what you can and cannot accomplish during a given period of time. Once you've recognized your limitations you can prioritize key concepts and learning goals., Understanding your broad goals gives you the freedom to have fun developing unique and engaging lessons that will help your students meet these goals.
