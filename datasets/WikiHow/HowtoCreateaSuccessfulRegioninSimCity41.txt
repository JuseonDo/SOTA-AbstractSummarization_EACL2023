 Choose whether you want it to be plains or water. Name your region. Next, click on a section of your region and choose "play".;
, Go to "God Mode" and begin shaping your landscape. Steep mountains and water cannot be zoned on. Remember that trees at this point are free, and also increase land value and health. Adding trees now will be very beneficial.
 Then zone some low density residential.
 Natural Gas is little more expensive to maintain but is well worth it as the pollution is much lower. Place this a short distance away from your residential zones and turn down its budget to fulfill your needs, plus 30% more (this will save you money). You should see a bit of development move in. The power plant only provides a few jobs, so growth will be small at this stage. This is normal though.
 This will provide quite a few jobs. Once development begins to slow down, save your city and exit to your region.
