@summary
draw a box that is 3 inches square on your paper, which should be laid horizontally.

@summary
shift to the right of the box about ½ inch and then down about 2 inches.

@summary
measure ½ inch to the left of the first box and then down about 2 inches.

@summary
draw a curved arrow to the right from the top box to the right box.

@summary
fill the boxes with information about a cycle.

 Set the box about 1-2 inches down from the top of the paper, and place it in the middle of the paper's width (i.e. there should be 4 inches on either side of the box).


Use a ruler to help you draw straight, even lines.
 Use your ruler to measure these distances.


Draw another box of the same dimensions (i.e. 3 inches square) in this new location.
This box should sit just to the right and down a bit from the first box, as if it is a step leading up to the first box.
 Again, draw a third box with 3 square inch dimensions using your ruler.


This box should also be just offset from the left side of the first box, also like a step leading up to the first box. Together, the three boxes should resemble a pyramid shape.
 Then, draw a curved arrow to the left from the right box across to the left one. Finally, draw a curved arrow to the right from the left box back to the top box.


The three boxes should now be connected in a “circle” by the three curved arrows between them. All arrows of the circle should point in a clockwise direction.
 This graphic organizer shows how a process occurs and then repeats over and over, as that is what a cycle does. You can add more boxes to the “circle” if you need them, but the boxes will have to be drawn in smaller dimensions.
