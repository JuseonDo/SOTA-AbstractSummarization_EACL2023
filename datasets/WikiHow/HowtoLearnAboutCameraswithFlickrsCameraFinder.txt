, Here, the Nikon D3100 has been selected.
 This will make it easier to compare it with your other possible choices.
 A few are:



Sensor Resolution/pixel count - 14.2 megapixels here
LCD Size - This is pretty specific to you. Big is nice, but not necessary.
Media Type - SD cards are a little easier to get hold of
Weight - If you are carrying it around, this is information you will want to know

Lens Mount - There are various types of lens and while most cameras will use the same mount for their make of camera, some don't. It is good information to have.
 Here you see that it had a steady decline until recently?? Nikon have a big sale??

,, You might want to do this to see how they compare with each other. For the most part, digital cameras, on Flickr, seemed to decline a bit. At least 2 of the Nikons. The D800 was all over the place and the Canon did fairly well but has a similar pattern as the 2 Nikons. Maybe, it's the iPhone?

, Flickr can do this as long as your images retain their EXIF information.
 Nikon here. You can see lots of different kinds of Nikons and the various data that they collect.
