 You can find organic garlic that is grown here in the U.S at most grocery stores or health food store.


Also always buy the loose bulbs, sometimes when buying them in bags, you will find some of the garlic is fresh and some of it is old. When buying one bulb at a time you can feel for firmness as well as checking that the skin is very tight and a light color, versus a dark yellow.
Also garlic should never stink or smell strong when you are buying it in the bulb. A sweet mellow garlic smell is best. After you have purchased your garlic and get it home, break off a clove or two and begin.;
, You will have the papery skin still attached to the clove. On the end of the clove you will see where it was connected to the bulb. There is a rough end. Trim this off with a sharp knife.


Once you have trimmed the rough end off. The skin will start to come off. Often times people suggest to smash the clove with a knife to get the skin off. It's, actually, rarely necessary to do this. If keeping the clove whole, you will be able to slice it.
 Usually if a small spot you can trim off and the garlic is still good. If two or more spots, just pitch it in the trash can and get another clove.
