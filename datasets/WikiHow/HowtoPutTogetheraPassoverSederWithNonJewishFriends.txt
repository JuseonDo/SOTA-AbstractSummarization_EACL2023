, If they feel out of place, explain to them that Jewish law considers it a blessing to invite guests over. Tell them the Passover service includes the invitation: "Let all who are hungry, come and eat."

, Non-Jews attending Passover Seder can become quickly overwhelmed by all that's going on. Let them know what to expect ahead of time, and let them know that Seders can run for 2 to 4 hours.
 Tell your non-Jewish friends that because the Jews were on the run, they didn't have time to wait for the bread to rise, so they ate it flat, which is called unleavened bread, and it's eaten for eight days. The only kosher food they're allowed to buy is food that says "Kosher for Passover," "May Be Used for Passover," and "Kosher for Passover All Year Round."

, This usually includes gefilte fish, chicken soup with matzo balls, and either chicken or turkey, with cooked honey carrots, and applesauce, and non-dairy desserts.
 It should have 3 matzo crackers in the middle of the plate, a burnt shank bone, horseradish root, parsley, salt water, a hard-boiled egg with a burnt shell, 3 matzo crackers, and charosetâ€”also haroset or charoses (a mixture of nuts, apples, and wine). Fill the Cup of Elijah with Passover wine.
 Make sure it's someone they feel comfortable asking questions to.
 Tell them that Hebrew is read backwards, and most of the Haggadahs have backwards pages.
 Include your non-Jewish guests in the questions and answers. Emphasize that asking and answering questions is an important part of the Seder, and they should feel free to ask why something is done.
