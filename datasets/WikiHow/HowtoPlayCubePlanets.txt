Draw some mountains and small trees (Unless your planet is tiny.)

, That's where the leader lives. It can be as high tech as a government lab,or hidden away in a cave with ninja guards.
 Think about what your inhabitants would need when making factories. Maybe you want to make spaceships. You would need fuel,so build a drilling machine. You'd need some strong material so you could find (draw)a mine. Then,you could have a rocket lab so they actually know how to make it.
 Or you could make soldiers and different kinds of units you buy with a game currency.


Briefly make some planets for alien races. It's recommended you make some animals there. You can then capture them and put in safaris. Each of your friends should do about 4 alien races.
