@summary
if your foam underneath is ripped or scruffy, you should replace that as well.

@summary
untie the cord from underneath the existing cover (it is probably wrapped around a plastic toggle.

@summary
zig zag stitch the raw edge.

@summary
sew about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) from the edge to make a channel for the string.

@summary
assuming your cord is synthetic (most are) singe the end with a lighter, then attach a small safety pin.

@summary
either tie off the ends, or use a piece of plastic with slits taken out of the sides (either make your own or use the toggle from the old cover) to secure the cord underneath.

 One thing that you can try is upholstery wadding underneath.;
, If it is, good, you have half of your materials already). Pull all the string out, and stretch the cover out flat. Lay the old cover on top of your fabric and cut around it, leaving about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) seam allowance (or more if you prefer a bigger allowance, or are adding extra padding).
 Then fold the edge over 2 centimeters (0.8 in) and pin.
 Start at the flat end and back stitch a few stitches to secure. When you get round to the same point, leave a gap of about 2cms (back stitching again) so you can slip your thread in and out. You don't need to be too precise, because it's all going to be underneath.Make sure you leave enough space to pass a safety pin through the channel.
 The reason we singe it is because they fray so easily and it's mighty annoying to get halfway round and find you've become detached. When you have threaded your cord all the way through (hurray!), secure the cover over the board and tighten the cord as much as it will go, smoothing the surface and tucking under as necessary.
