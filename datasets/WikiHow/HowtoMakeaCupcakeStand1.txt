 A platter or plate is ideal.;
, It needs to be tall, so a martini glass, a wide brimmed glass or vase or something similar is ideal.
 This forms the only layer you'll make.
 While it is possible to very carefully move this stand, it's best not to!

,, Balance with care.
 If wished, you can also add to the base layer but if you don't have enough cupcakes, that's fine, just use the top layer only, as this is the layer which draws the eye.
