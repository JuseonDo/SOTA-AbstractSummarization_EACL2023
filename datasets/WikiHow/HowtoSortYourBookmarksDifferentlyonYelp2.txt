"Distance from Me" (Yelp default) will sort them (using the GPS sensor) into imaginary circles of distance from the phone to the address written on the business' page.
"Alphabetically" will sort them in A to Z order. There is currently no option to sort them in Z to A order (as Yelp finds this useless, and feels A to Z order is more important to it's users).
