 Perhaps it was a technical glitch, or a temporary ban. If you can access your RuneScape account, remember not to break the RuneScape rules, or else your next ban could be permanent.;
, If Jagex states a reason for your ban, and if you are guilty of doing whatever it is that the reason states, you can still fight to get your account back.
 In your appeal, remember to be honest, keep it short, and use correct English. If you don't, Jagex is less likely to listen.
 You will have access to it 3 weeks after you have written your first appeal. However, make sure you have a strong case. Once your final appeal is rejected, however, all you can do is wait.
 (However, there is always the possibility that you have gotten a permanent mute instead. In this case, you are less likely to break the rules.)
