, Depending on the quantity of martinis you are planning to make, add a teaspoon or several to the saucer.
 As you lift up the glass, gently swirl it to give it a cleaner appearance.
 Gently roll the rim in it, using the water as an adhesive.
 Fill it about halfway with ice.
, Secure the lid and vigorously shake it for a few seconds. You will know when the contents are cold when you see condensation building up on the outside of the shaker.
