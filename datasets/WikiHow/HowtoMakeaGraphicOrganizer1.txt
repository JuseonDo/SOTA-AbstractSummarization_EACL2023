@summary
draw a circle on a blank piece of paper.

@summary
draw a second circle that overlaps the first in the middle of the paper.

@summary
ensure that there is enough space to write on the far sides of both circles and where they overlap in the middle.

@summary
use the venn diagram for comparing and contrasting two things.

@summary
contrast the two things in the outer circles and compare them in the middle overlap.

 It is best to lay the paper horizontally so that you have plenty of room for drawing.


Using a compass to help you draw the circle will make sure that it is evenly sized and neat. If using a compass, gently hold both legs of the compass to avoid having the pencil end push out, enlarging your circle and making it uneven.
Draw the circle to one side, not in the middle.;
, For example, if you drew your first circle more to the right, then this circle should sit more to the left while still overlapping the first.


Keep your compass at the same setting so that your two circles are the same size.
 If you do not have enough space, then it would be best to erase and start over, or to start over from scratch on a new piece of paper, with bigger circles.
 At the top of each circle, write the things you are comparing, such as books, people, movies, animals, et cetera. Where the circle overlaps in the middle, write “Both.”

, In each of the outer circles, list details about each thing that make it distinctly separate and different from the other thing. In the middle, list details that those two things have in common.
