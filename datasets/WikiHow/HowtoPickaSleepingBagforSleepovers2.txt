tell them that you want one for real reasons.
@article
, Begging, whining, and crying make you look pathetic.
 Here are some good reasons:


You don't have a sleepover currently, and for sleepovers and camp-outs, you will need one.
The one you have now will get you mad fun of at school and at social places. Your social status can't afford to drop much lower.
It's more hygienic or less hassle than using other people's sheets and blankets.
