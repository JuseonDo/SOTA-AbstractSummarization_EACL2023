 Welcome mats are used to take the dirt off your feet before entering the home and can also be used at the beach to help with removing excess sand too. Bring one for each person to use., When the beach day is over, take the mats from the car and put them on the ground. Stand on top of them.
 Begin dusting off large chunks of sand from your feet. For any additional sand left over, use a dry towel to help remove any stubborn grains.
