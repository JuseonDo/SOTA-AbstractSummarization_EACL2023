 Some sandwich shops are just an open counter onto the street, while others have a small seating area where customers can enjoy their sandwiches;
, The best way to do this is to request a list of requirements from your local Chamber of Commerce or board of health.
 Find out what competitors offer, what their prices are and whether they offer seating for customers.



There's a better chance of attracting customers in high traffic areas like cities, tourist areas or near college campuses than in a low traffic area like a suburb.
 If possible, come up with inventive sandwiches or food combinations like specific soups and sandwiches, or include vegetarian or organic ingredients.
 A nicely designed exterior and interior with a catchy name can help your shop stand out.



Remember to include the costs of necessary licenses and permits, location, equipment, supplies, marketing, staff and taxes.
, Always check with the city to find out if zoning laws allow for a sandwich shop in that area. Obtain any special permits.
 Also buy a cash register and accounting software.


You'll need bread knives, cutting knives, forks, cutting boards and plates. If you plan on serving warm sandwiches, equipment can include a grill, toaster oven and frying pans.
 Choose candidates who are friendly, personable, efficient and skilled at making sandwiches.
 These include ingredients for your menu as well as napkins, paper bags and other disposable items customers need with a take-out sandwich.
 Be sure to clearly state your hours so people know when they can come in.
