 When you're pronouncing it, put the two letters together so you say it like the word present.;
, The a in Prague is soft, meaning it will sound like aw or ah, for example in the word father.
 The gue in Prague is just a hard G. So you will pronounce gue as if you were about to say go or guy.
 Once you try to say the whole word, it should sound like the word frog without a f and starting with pr instead.
