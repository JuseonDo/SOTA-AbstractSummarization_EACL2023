 Add a small amount of concealer under your eyes and on any blemishes. If possible, get one with SPF.;
, Use a tinted moisturizer or BB cream with an SPF. You will be on the mountain (if you're downhill skiing) or in the woods (if you're cross country skiing) quite a while and the sun will be beating down on your face and any other exposed skin, so you will want to protect your skin.
 Press in powder to set everything so that it will stay all day.
 Use a small amount of waterproof eyeliner, something that won't smudge and will stay put and not bleed if you tear up from wind.
 Use a waterproof mascara that will not smudge or bleed all day.
 If you would rather something more protective go for a tinted lip balm.
