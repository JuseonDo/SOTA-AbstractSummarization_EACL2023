before you get a secret myspace account because your parents prohibit you using it, try talking to your parents.

@summary
your parents are probably just trying to keep you safe, if all else fails, follow this guide but always be careful.

@summary
make sure you close, or slightly shut, the door of the room you're using.

@summary

download a copy of "matrix locker": this is programme similar to a screensaver which shows the "the matrix" code but you can set a separate password from your user password.

make sure to use a browser with tabbed browsing, so if and when your parents come in, you can switch to another tab, and it will say you are on that site and not myspace.if your parents know your email address make new one just for your myspace page (keep it simple)

@summary
go to myspace.com and make a myspace page.

@summary
now that you've created your profile, get a picture, background, etc.

ask your friends not to tell your parents that you have a myspace, but friends can be airheads sometimes, and forget.

@summary
when you're talking to friends, try using an abbreviation for myspace, such as "ms" or "the space".

have fun being a myspace user.

 Ask them about their concerns and try to make compromises as, for example, not using your real (last) name, city, age and/or any pictures of yourself.;
,, If you have a computer in your room, make sure it can't be seen when you first walk in. Get a bead curtain if it's your room, a loud one. They might imagine, rightfully, that you could get yourself into to some trouble.


Alternatively, you could try to find a place that isn't connected to your parents' Internet. If you have a laptop or other WiFi capable device, try connecting to a neighbor's network. If this isn't an option, try using a computer at your public library or at a friend's house.
 Myspace is great for music and videos. Don't use headphones, you may not hear your parents entering the room and then get caught.
, If you don't, then practice. You must know how to type fast, and click fast.
, Make sure to use something innocent like "Google", "MSN", "Weather.com", or a news page. If you liked "neopets.com" when you were younger, say you still think it is fun and use that, but avoid this if you used to say 'Neopets sucks!' because that would arouse suspicion.
, Choose a plain, simple, and most importantly correctly spelled URL name. Avoid words like "heart," gurl/boi," "xoxo," "roxxer" or similar, as they are extremely lame and make you look childish, aside from the fact that you will later regret choosing such a stupid URL name. Preferably, you should exclude your name in one form or another. Avoid using your full name like "Melissa Bourne" for your Myspace name as it's easier to find you and your Myspace.
 Also add as many of your friends as possible. Try searching for them, or call them up and ask for their Myspace profile URLs. You don't have to ask every single one of your friends, since your friends will most likely be linked together.
 So just make up a clever excuse you can use.
 If your parents overhear (which they could), they will find out.
, If you do, your parents might search Myspace for your name and find your account. Unless you decide to be sneaky and use a false name such as Jane Doe for other protection purposes as well.
