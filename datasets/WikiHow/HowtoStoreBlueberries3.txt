 You will be freezing the berries individually first. This will prevent them from sticking and clumping together.You can also use a pan, casserole dish, or baking sheet. If you are using something made from metal, consider lining it first with parchment paper to protect the blueberries.
 It will take about two to three hours for the berries to freeze completely.
 Pull the tray out of the freezer carefully so as not to spill any of the berries. You can scoop them into the bag by hand or simply tip the tray over the opening of the bag.
 The berries will be good for up to one year.


You do not need to thaw frozen blueberries before baking with them, however rinsing them with cool water until the water runs clear may help prevent them from releasing too many juices during baking.
