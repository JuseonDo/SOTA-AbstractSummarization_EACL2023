, The salt will stick to the lime and will provide the perfect bite for the drink.
 Combine 1 1/2 oz. of high quality vodka, 4 oz. of tomato juice, a dash of celery salt, a dash of freshly ground cracked pepper, 8 shakes of Worcestershire sauce, 1/8 teaspoons of horseradish, and 1-2 dashes of hot sauce together in a glass.
, Use a stirring spoon to mix all of the ingredients together until they're thoroughly blended.
 Stir the mixture a bit more so it cools down more quickly.
, Place a pickled asparagus spear and a picked green bean into the drink to give it an extra kick.
 Enjoy this refreshing and relaxing drink any time.
