make a coca cola ice cream float.
@article
 Simply add a few teaspoons of cola to any of your favorite dips for that extra sweetness and zing.
 Put the cola in the glass first or else the cola will all turn to foam. For a deluxe float first start with half a tall glass with Coke, then ice cream, then a splash of cola on tip to create a foam topping.
