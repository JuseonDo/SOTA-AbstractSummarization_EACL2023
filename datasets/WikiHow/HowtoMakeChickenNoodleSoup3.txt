 Use a sharp knife to remove the breasts from a chicken carcass and set them aside. Discard the skin. Then, remove the legs from the chicken and set them aside as well. Use a heavy knife to chop the chicken’s body into fine pieces.,, Add 4 oz. of smoked ham, 1 minced three-inch knob of ginger, 4 smashed garlic cloves, the finely-chopped dry outer leaves of 1 stalk of lemon grass, the stems of 1 small bunch of cilantro, the stems of 1 small bunch of mint, and the whites of six scallions to the saucepan.
 After the water simmers, you can reduce the heat to low and skim the foam from the surface of the water, topping it with hot water when necessary.
 This will begin to cook the chicken and combine the flavors.
,, Set them aside. Discard the remaining chicken parts.
,, Add 1 finely sliced medium yellow onion, 2 finely sliced medium carrots,1 finely sliced head of Napa cabbage, and 1 finely sliced Thai bird chili to the pot. Cook these ingredients until the vegetables are tender.
 You may need to cook the noodles for a bit longer, depending on the directions on the package.
 Once the chicken cools down enough so that it can be easily handled, use your hands to shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Remove the skin and bones.
 Add 3 tbsp. of fish sauce, 1/4 cup of lime juice, 1 tbsp. of soy sauce, and the shredded chicken to the pot. Season the soup to taste with Kosher salt.
 Garnish the soup with the leaves from 1 bunch of cilantro and 1 bunch of mint, and the greens from 6 scallions.
 Enjoy this spicy soup while it’s hot.
