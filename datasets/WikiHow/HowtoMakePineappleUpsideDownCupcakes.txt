, With an electric mixer on medium speed, mix the ingredients together together until there are no lumps in the batter. Spoon the batter into the cupcake tins so that each tin is about halfway full.
 Sprinkle about a teaspoon of the mixture on top of the cupcake batter in tins. Now add a layer of about a tablespoon of pineapple. If you want, put a cherry on top.
 Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes. Carefully run a dinner knife around the edges of the cupcakes and invert the cupcake pan onto the wire rack. Let the cupcakes cool for about 20 minutes. ENJOY!
