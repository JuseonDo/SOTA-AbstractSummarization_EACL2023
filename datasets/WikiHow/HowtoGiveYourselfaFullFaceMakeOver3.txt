 Because every person has variations of skin color and tone, there is no one size fits all solution. The salesperson at a large retailer is usually trained to help customers select the best types and colors of products for the individual.
 Many make up manufacturers have trained specialists demonstrating their product with special offers from time to time. Revlon, Clinique, and others will provide a free skin analysis and application demonstration during one of these clinics.
 Buy a few tubes of lipstick, some eyeliner, eye shadow, and other products, sit down in front of a mirror in the privacy of your room, and try them all out.
