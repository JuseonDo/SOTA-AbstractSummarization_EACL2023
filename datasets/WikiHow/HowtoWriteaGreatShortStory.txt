 Using worksheets or just thinking a lot about your story is good.
 When you just hint and foreshadow, it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Make sure that as you go, start sprinkling in more hints, and start adding good detail about small features of the main character. Like this:Her aquamarine eyes glittered like brilliantly shined gemstones in the shadowy half-light.
 That's when characters are introduced and setting is introduced. Short stories usually follow the format in these steps.
 Think about the climax while you write it.
 Readers love details. But don't go overboard. If you go down to the very fibers that make up the rotting rug in the old shack, then your audience will think you're trying too hard to impress them.
 You lose your readers, and that's not good for you or them. Have your story be about five or six pages long. Think of it from the audience's perspective, and cut out some of the extra details, like a couple of details describing something of the past, or of the present scene.
 Make your climax dramatic and interesting. It should be the turning point in your story!

, This should consist of only a few, less dramatic events.
 This should tie up all loose ends, or at least leave the reader happy!

, Listen to all constructive criticism.
, Show it off to everyone!
