 Flatten and even out the tops as much as possible to get a more presentable surface.
 Carefully cut it out and dust any crumbs off., Then take the 5 1⁄2 inch (14.0 cm) circle and place it at one of the edges of the 8 inch (20.3 cm) and frost it. Carefully place the 3 1⁄2 inch (8.9 cm) circle on top of the 5 1⁄2 inch (14.0 cm) circle at its edge and frost this layer. It should form something like a staircase instead of regular cake layers., You can either place them in a sandwich bag and smash them, roll them with a rolling pin, or blend them with a food processor to make crumbs., The wafer crumbs will resemble the "sand" of your castle., Place them around the cake, for example a few around the bottom layer and one at the very top., Use a dab of frosting around the edges of each of them and place them upside down (pointy-side up) on each ice cream cup., Divide the rest of the graham cracker sticks in half and place them around the rims of the layers. Use the rest of the wafer crumbs (or break some leftover graham cracker sticks into crumbs) around the outside of the cake for the final touch., Get round candy to use as rocks, goldfish crackers to use around the cake, etc.,
