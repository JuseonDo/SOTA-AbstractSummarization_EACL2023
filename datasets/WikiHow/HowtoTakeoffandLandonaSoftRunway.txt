@summary
while taxiing, apply full back pressure on the yoke (pull it towards you) to relieve the pressure on the nose wheel.

@summary
if you can, don't stop at the hold short line (only if you have permission to do so and traffic conditions allow for it).

@summary
once you have obtained clearance (only at towered airports), taxi onto the runway and align on the center-line.

@summary
,

@summary
do not stop.

@summary
the nose will begin to rise.

@summary
the plane will takeoff on its own.

@summary
as the speed increases, you will need to apply even more forward pressure on the yoke.

@summary
once you reach a safe airspeed (usually the best rate of climb also known as vy), raise the nose and climb, maintaining vy.

@summary
enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the ctaf.

@summary
,

@summary
fly the standard traffic pattern, beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway.

@summary
when the runway is 45° over your shoulder, turn base and lower another 10° of flaps.

@summary
,

@summary
turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely (30° or 40° depending on the aircraft).

@summary
once you are a couple feet above the runway, gently flare and add a little bit of power.

@summary
as soon as the main gear touches the runway, pull the power back to idle.

@summary

@summary
apply full back pressure on the yoke to keep the nose wheel off the ground.

@summary
holding full back pressure, taxi off the runway to make room for other traffic.

 Keep the braking to a minimum as much as possible so you can keep your inertia. Depending on conditions you may want to lower your flaps to 10° at this point.;
, Always obey the controller if at a towered airport. Look for traffic approaching to land. Lower the flaps to 10° if you haven't already. When all is clear, radio the tower or announce your intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). CTAF is used at non-towered airports or when the tower is closed.
, As soon as you are lined up, smoothly apply full power and continue to hold the yoke back.
 Continue to hold back pressure to keep the nose wheel off the ground. The cowling should be aligned with the horizon.
 Quickly, but smoothly, apply forward pressure to lower the nose. The plane is off the ground but does not have enough lift to fly. This is called Ground Effect. It feels as if the plane is flying on a cushion of air between the wings and the ground (although this is not really the case at all--that feeling is caused by the ground interfering with the wingtip vortices/down wash, reducing overall drag and therefore increasing airplane performance). If you go too high, you will lose this cushion, the drag will increase thus decreasing airplane performance and lift, and you may crash. Try to keep you altitude above the runway approximately equal to your wingspan.
 You will feel like you are flying in a nose low pitch attitude--and you are!

, This information can be found in your Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).
, Don't forget to lower 10° of flaps.
, Once you have the runway made, pull the throttle to idle.
 Adding a little power at this point allows you slow your decent rate, and keeps you from slamming into the ground and flipping the plane. It also allows you to touch down at a slower airspeed making for a softer landing.
, Allow it to settle on its own.
 You may need enough speed to avoid settling and getting stuck - use caution!
