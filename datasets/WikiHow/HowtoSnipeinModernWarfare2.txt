@summary
set up a class for how you're going to play, there are different types of sniping.

@summary
at the beginning of the game you don't want to rush the enemy by going to their spawn point at the beginning - you'll just get yourself killed.

@summary
once you see someone, take your time to shoot them, especially if you're new to sniping, it doesn't matter if you get more deaths than kills, practice makes perfect.

@summary
most people use the intervention or barrett because these guns are powerful and help get one-hit kills.

@summary
play in ground war or team death-match.

 They are explained below. Make a class which you are comfortable with which means you need to experiment with the guns and perk combination's. A lot of people use the Intervention and Barrett 50. Cal. These guns are much easier to get kills with as they have more damage than the others. It is recommend trying these out first and as you get better at Sniping, you try out the WA2000 and M21 EBR.;
, Before the game started you should have had a rough idea of how you were going to play. You can run about Quick-Scoping, you can sit in cover picking off enemy's (Camping) or you can do what lots of people do which is sitting in an area for a few kills then moving to a new spot get a few kills and repeat.
, But the other Sniper Rifles are still good to use, they are normally harder to use though as they have smaller multipliers (Damage to where the person is shot) so only use these if playing in Hardcore or you aim for the chest up.
 These put less pressure on you and let you practice sniping freely. More experienced snipers will often play all modes though. Another mode which is good for sniping is Domination, it gives you an objective to cover meaning you're more likely to get kills/kill-streaks.
 Don't try to counter-snipe until you are a semi-good sniper.
