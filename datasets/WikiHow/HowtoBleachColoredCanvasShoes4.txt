 You can use a spray bottle to completely cover your sneakers with bleach, or to splatter them. Here's a lit of what you will need:Canvas sneakers
Bleach
Water
Spray bottle with nozzle
Rubber gloves

, This will help you bleach them more evenly, and prevent you from damaging the laces.
 Even though you are working with a spray bottle, there is a good chance that some bleach may drip onto your skin. The gloves will keep your skin safe.
 For a stronger solution, use one part bleach and one part water. For a weaker solution, use one part bleach and two parts water. The bottle should have a nozzle with two to three settings: spray, mist, and off.
 This will mix up the bleach and water inside.
 Use the "spray" setting to squirt a few splatters onto your sneakers. This will give you a sort of galaxy effect. Use the "mist" setting and spray your shoes all over to completely bleach them., This may take around 20 minutes to several hours. The longer you leave them out, the lighter they will become. Keep in mind that some darker fabrics will never turn white. Some, such as black, may turn brown or orange.
 This will not only stop the bleach from acting, but it will also get rid of the smell.
