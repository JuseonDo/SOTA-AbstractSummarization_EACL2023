 Add guidelines for the face, as shown, crossing where the bridge of his glasses will be.;
, Within these rectangles draw dots for the eyes. Draw small half circles for the ears. Draw a wavy shape for his nose.
 It should be thick, puffy, and all over the place, as shown.
 Add in a set of two ovals for the arms. Draw his right hand, dangling to his side from the two overlapping ovals.
 The rectangles should be the same size all the way down, and the feet look kind of like rocks.
 Hermes wears a button-up shirt tucked into a high-waisted pants, and a jacket over top of that.
 Make sure no excess guidelines remain.
