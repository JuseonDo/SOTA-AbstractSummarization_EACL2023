 Assign these now. Skill points are what make your player. You use skill points to increase your player's attributes.



You automatically will have 3 contract offers. These offers come from computer-ran teams in the D-League(Developmental leagues). You can reject these offers, and 3 new CPU offers will appear the next day.
Look for a pro team(all pro teams are owned by humans)who will sign you.
 The D-Leagues are full of new players who want to gain some experience before jumping to the pro leagues. D-Leagues are a great way to start out. Keep in mind that you gain experience first and foremost through playing in games. This requires building new players with stamina points, and also signing with a team that doesn't already have a lot of players at your position.
