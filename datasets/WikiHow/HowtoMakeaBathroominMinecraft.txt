 Make sure that it’s 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks long.;
, In the second block of the row that’s closest to you, eliminate the block to make a hole.
 This will contain the water.
 Put water on the hole.
 In the second block of the row that’s farthest from you, place a block that will act as the toilet water tank.
 This will act as a toilet seat.
 It would be best to create a hole in a corner.
 Build it on the roof where the hole is.
 The water should come down through the hole as a pillar of water for you to shower in.


To turn the shower off, place a block in the hole.
If you are good (basic learners should be able to do this too) with redstone, feel free to use a dispenser and a lever.
 Make sure it's 2 blocks high against a wall in your bathroom.
 On the side closest to the wall, break 6 blocks.
, This will allow you to easily climb into it.
