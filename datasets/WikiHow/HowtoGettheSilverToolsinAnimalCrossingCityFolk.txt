 It gives you a better chance of getting extra money from the Money Rock. To get it, you must head to the City, on a random night 8:00PM-12:00AM, the pylons to the side you might have noticed already, may have been moved. Enter, and talk to Resetti. He will give you the Silver Shovel. You won't always get it on your first try, though.;
, It can revive turnips. This is the simplest to get. Just purchase 50 Flower Seeds, do whatever with the flowers, and once you've accomplished this, you should get a letter from Posy Farm with the Silver Can. It can take a while depending on which store you currently have.
 You must donate to the town fund until you get the fountain. The fountain is not the first upgrade for your town, though. Once this is done, throw your Regular Axe into the fountain, answer Serena's questions, and ask for a Silver Axe, if you're lucky, she will give you it. She might give you the gold one, however. Sometimes, she will give your axe back or nothing at all! Be careful when answering!

, Just go to Nook's Store daily, and if it's on sale, buy it! It is around the same price as a normal one.
 It is obtained the same way as the Silver Rod.
 It is obtained the same way as the Silver Rod, and Silver Net.
