 Some rumors on the internet claim you need to beat the game before you get Luigi, but this is only true for the sequel, not the original., This is the screen with you three potential save files, allowing you to have three games at once. Do not pick your game just yet.
 This will work with any file. Make sure the game you want to play has the selection box around it.
 Keep both of them held down simultaneously.
 This should unlock the plucky, lanky Luigi to play. You can repeat this procedure anytime you'd rather play with him instead of Mario.
 You should hear Luigi shout out "Luigi!" if you have done it correctly. If not, turn the DS off and try again.


Keep L and R held down the entire time, only letting go after you hear the green bomber's signature voice., Shifting to Luigi is purely cosmetic -- he doesn't have any different stats or playing characteristics. He will have different sound effects and animations, however!Some people believe Luigi has a higher jump, but slips and slides more than Mario. However, there is no evidence of this change from the manufacturers. This is likely because he is more powerful in the game "New Super Luigi U."
