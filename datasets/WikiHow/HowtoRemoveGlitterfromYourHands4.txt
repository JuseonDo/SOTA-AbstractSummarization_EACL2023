Sellotape or sticking plasters can be used in place of masking tape if that is all you can find.However, be aware that these will be harsher on your skin.
 You can either use the length or form little balls with the sticky side facing outward. Just be careful not to make sharp edges that will poke into your skin.
 Stick, then pull and a whole lot of glitter will come up with it. Repeat to collect more.
 Continue until all of the glitter has been collected.
 When done, wash your hands with warm, soapy water and discard the used masking tape.
