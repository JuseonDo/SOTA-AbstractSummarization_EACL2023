 Once you have found Mr/Ms Right, be completely honest about who you are and what you are looking for. This is not the time to play. Many people use the internet to pretend. However, when you are dating remember that you are playing with people's hearts and minds. This is not the time to play unless you tell everyone you are playing.;
, Be very creative with your words, thoughts and actions. Remember you may be at a distance and you have the computer separating you, so you need to come on a little stronger than you would face to face.
 You can be casual in your conversation. Be alive, interested and energetic in your conversation. Avoid expressing loneliness and despair.
 This does not have to take up your day, but just 5-10 minutes here and there throughout the day can really make a difference.
 You will still need to see if this is the one all the way to the bank.
, This attitude will keep you both from trying to make everything perfect and allow you both not to feel trapped.
 Once in the presence of your lover reality will set in. This is a difficult adjustment, because the distance allows for a certain amount of fantasy. Some of that will leave, but if it is a good connection and if you are mature it will not be enough to make you change your mind.
 You don't want to move close to the love of your life if you are going to be kept a secret.
