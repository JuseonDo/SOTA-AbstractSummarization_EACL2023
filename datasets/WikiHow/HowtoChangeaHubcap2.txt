 This is a simple, easy safety measure that should not be ignored. Don't be working on the wheels or under the care without making sure that the car can't move.
 If it is not immediately visible, it could be under a plastic piece. Use a screwdriver to pry this small cover off carefully.
 Take care to place the screw somewhere safe so it will not roll away or get lost.
 Thread it in by hand to start, then grab the screwdriver afterward.
 Tighten it enough that it doesn't move, but don't feel like you need to break your back turning it.
