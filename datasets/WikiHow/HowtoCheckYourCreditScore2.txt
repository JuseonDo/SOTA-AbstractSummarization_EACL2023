 The major credit bureaus in the United States are TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, and each of their websites will allow you to directly purchase.


You will need to supply personal identification information before gaining access to your credit score. The process requires answers to questions only you may know, such as what your mortgage payment is or your Social Security number.
Purchasing a credit report along with your score can be helpful. Errors on your credit report could affect your score and should be reported to the credit bureau.
 If you need to look at your credit score and you've already used up your annual free credit report, you're going to need to dish out a little money in order to take a gander.
 Each of the credit bureaus sets their own costs associated with purchasing your credit reports and scores in this manner.
