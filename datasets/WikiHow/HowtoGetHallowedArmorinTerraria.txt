 To begin, you will need lots of adamantite, mythril, and cobalt. Look below for where to find these ores:


Cobalt: Anywhere you can find metals such as iron or silver.
Mythril: Somewhat deeper than gold, in the deep caverns.
Adamantite: Extremely deep, directly above the underworld.;
,
Mythril breastplate, helmet, and leggings.
Cobalt breastplate, helmet, and leggings

, These are what to add:


Adamantite chestplate + adamantite helmet + adamantite leggings.
Mythril chestplate + mythril helmet + mythril leggings.
Cobalt chestplate + cobalt helmet+ cobalt leggings.
 Now put on your armor.
