 Though you certainly don't have to become lifelong best friends with every student, you must be polite to everyone and eliminate any shyness you might have. If you see someone sitting alone, strike up a conversation with them.;
, Putting up posters for a make-believe campaign is not a good start to your career in politics.
 Make sure they are eye-catching and have cute slogans. Being original shows people you can have original ideas in the future. For example: Making the world a better place since (insert birth year). (insert name).
 Don't say you'll bring a unicorn to school or anything your school's funds can't easily afford. Give the reasons you're qualified (do you volunteer with Habitat For Humanity? Have you been in student council since sixth grade? Things like that.), why you want to run, a sample of your ideas, and some of the steps you would take to achieve them. Spend time on your speech, and be sure to edit it several times. Finally, make sure you know your speech well enough to make contact with your audience while saying it in a confident voice (memorizing it might be a good idea, but you certainly don't have to).
 Candy, chips, cute accessories, etc. More people will think, Oh yeah, she's/he's cool. Make sure you're not violating any school rules by doing this before you go ahead with it, though; being disqualified won't exactly help your chances at being elected.
 It will surely increase the number of votes you get.
