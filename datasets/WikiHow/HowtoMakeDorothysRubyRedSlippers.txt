 Avoid using new shoes.;
,, If using spray paint, follow directions on label and read the warnings, if using acrylics, make sure you have sufficient experience to guarantee evenness, if you don't, use spray paint.
 Try to buy red shoes straight up; this will avoid the 'home-made/cheap' look, and cut down the time and effort required.,, Glue guns work in a similar fashion to an electric stovetop, so it may take awhile (1-2 min) for the wires in the glue gun to heat up enough to melt the glue.
, Place them as close together as possible, but don't shove them together (this step will take a long time, so play some music or put on a movie, but not a very interesting one, otherwise you will get nothing done). You can also use spray glue in a can similar to hairspray, found in your local craft store, and any type of glitter. This method is a lot faster. Just spray and sprinkle glitter on shoes. Use newspaper so you can reuse excess glitter.
, If they are, replace them, only this time, use a little more glue.
