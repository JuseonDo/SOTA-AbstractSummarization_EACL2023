 This will serve as the base pose for your Leprechaun.
 Remember that leprechauns are small and almost elf-like in nature—try to depict that in your proportions.
 Remember that leprechauns usually have a beard and elf-like ears.
 Draw the body as shown.
 Make sure to erase all of your guidelines.
 Add in a pot of gold and a rainbow if desired.
 Draw a circle in the center of the page. Inside the circle, draw two perpendicular lines—one going vertically and one going horizontally.;
, Add a truncated cone on top of the circle. This will be the hat.
 It should connect with the bottom of the hat. This will be the beard. Then, on each upper side of the semicircle draw a small pointy arch shape.
 This will be the body.
 Position them as if the leprechaun is showing you something.
 To draw, draw a circle with a ring around it. You can also add handles if you wish.
 This will make the pants.
