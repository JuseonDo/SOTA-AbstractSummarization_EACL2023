, If they are in the I form then bring more guys to the line. If the formation is shotgun blitz five (All the linemen and an outside linebacker or two if you play 3-4).
 This will be key for opening up running lanes and getting yards after the catch.
 Every team has a weakness, such as the Dallas Cowboys with defense on quarterbacks (real life.) For example, if your opponent has horrible offensive skills, try to intercept the ball or hold them to three and outs.
 Ideally, you should be able to run every play in your playbook. Learn it inside and out. Diversity is very important as a veteran player will sniff out and counter players who use only 3-5 strong money plays every game.
