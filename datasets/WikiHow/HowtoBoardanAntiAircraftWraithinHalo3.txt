@article
 They can only be found on Halo 3's campaign and are a common objective for you to eliminate. They are of a brighter colour than their purple, normal Wraith counterparts and can be be quickly identified by their tell-tale anti aircraft guns which shoot into the sky.;
, If you eliminate them, the Wraith will be much easier to attack and approach.
 This can be done by shooting them with a sniper or beam rifle aimed at his head. The carbine or battle rifle are also effective, although it may take significantly longer to kill the gunner by this method.
 The Wraith is easiest to jump onto from behind, since the driver will be unaware of your presence and if you have eliminated all other enemies in the area, then you should have no problem staying on once you've jumped up.
 You can find it on top of the main vehicle - make sure you are aiming with your cross-hair at it to melee that exact spot.
 Be careful not to kill him, only to just dislodge his helmet.
 If it shows up at the last second, use the Right Bunker again to dismount and try the process again. Once the Right Bunker is held, shoot the driver in the head until he dies.
 You will now be able to enjoy your new Anti Aircraft Wraith!
