@summary
discuss with your toddler that you think it's time to give up the pacifier.

@summary
create a sticker chart with the days of the week on it.

@summary
plan a specific date that the child knows and understands as the last day for a pacifier.
@article
 Let them be active in the decision by offering them rewards for each day they go without the pacifier.
 For every day they go without their pacifier, let them put a sticker on the chart and praise them for a job well done. If they ask for their pacifier during the day, let them know they will not get a sticker.
 Birthdays work well for this, since the pacifier can easily be "replaced" by gifts. Gifts that your child recognizes as signifying a transition to older childhood - such as a toy reserved for or identified with "big kids" - are also especially effective for this.
