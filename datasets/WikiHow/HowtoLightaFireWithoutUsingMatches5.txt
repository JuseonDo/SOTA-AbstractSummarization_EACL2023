 Collect dry small twigs, dried grass, dry moss, lichen, etc. for kindling. Also gather thin pieces of wood for when the kindling is burning well.
 Clear away flammable items and steer clear of tents, trees, etc.
 Some locations have more flint than others. It will work best if it has a sharp edge.
 A pocket knife is often handy when camping.
 Position yourself next to the tinder. Strike until sparks start the tinder burning.
 This will help it to take hold.
 Once the kindling is burning nicely, add the first wood.
