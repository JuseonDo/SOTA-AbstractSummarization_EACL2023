assess the possibilities: is there a lot of small-scale litter around that needs clearing to make your neighbourhood (school campus or whatever) look just that bit better and smarter?,

@summary
work with a community group (such as neighbourhood watch, residents' association, etc.),

@summary
agree a date and time.

@summary
purchase needed equipment, if funds are available (you can ask for contributions if necessary) buy heavy-duty rubberizedÂ  gloves, rubbish bags and rent a skip/dumpster that can be sited in or near the site you intend to clean up.

@summary
arrange a reward for volunteers -- have non-pickers-up bring drinks and snacks, cakes, etc. to hand out to pickers-up at the end of the cleaning session.

 Note where the worst stuff is, its nature, and what could conceivably be done with a few hours' labour from a number of people.;
, use this as a vehicle for reaching the local residents; if not, you will need to talk to quite a few of your neighbours and perhaps set up a meeting. Describe the problem and your potential solution. Be open to others' contributions to the discussion.
 You don't want to ask people to spend more than an hour or two, so you need volunteers to feel that their time is worth spending in this way.
 If you can't get a skip, ask the local authority if they will pick up the bags you collect.
 This is a good way to allow participation by those whose disabilities or limitations might preclude them bending over a lot to pick up cigarette butts and crisp (potato chip) bags. If there's a community space, a bit of entertainment from the musically gifted whilst consuming the cakes is also a lot of fun and much appreciated.
