@summary
define the negative emotions (or issues) that are causing you problems, then identify its intensity by assigning a level from 0 to 10.

@summary
clarify your setup phrase, which must be specific.

@summary
repeat your setup phrase while tapping the 'karate chop point' - the soft spot on the side of either hand - just below your little finger.

@summary
come up with a reminder phrase.

@summary
tap through all of the following points, repeating your reminder phrase:

@summary
inner eyebrow, just above the inner "corner" of the eye, on the bone.

@summary
now that you've completed your first round of tapping, ask yourself what level the emotion/feeling/discomfort is at, on a 1 to 10 scale again.

@summary
,

@summary
repeat the process until, at the end of the final round, when you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, it's 2 or less.

@summary
your reminder phrases can then be "i'm free of this now", "don't need it anymore", "i'm strong and confident", etc.

@article
 0 would be "non-existent" and 10 would be the most severe.;
, For example, "Even though I feel tense and angry when strangers look at me, I totally and completely love, forgive and accept myself anyway". Or, "Even though I fly into a rage when someone makes fun of my green hair and three heads, I totally and completely love, forgive and accept myself anyway". Or, "Even though I feel hurt, sad and devastated that (name of person) has dumped me, I totally and completely love, forgive and accept myself anyway". Get the idea?

, Tap the point around 7 times (although there's really no need to count).
 This will be spoken aloud while tapping the other meridian points (refer to video below). Reminder phrases will be a brief reminder of the setup phrase, for example "strangers looking at me", "hate being looked at". Or, "(name of person) dumped me", "dumped me!", "feel gutted", etc.

Outer eye: outside edge of the eye, on the bone.
Under the eye: below the center of the eye, again, on the bone.
Under the nose, between the nose and the lip.
On the chin, right in the middle where the crease is
On your chest. Find the "U" shaped bone below your throat, go down 2 inches (5.1 cm) and then 2 inches (5.1 cm) either to the right or left.
Under your arm: where your bra strap is or three inches under the crease of your arm. Guys, make a good guess.
Some people also like to tap their wrist points at this stage: Insides of wrists facing each other, tap them lightly together.
Top of head: In the middle.
, In that instance, your final setup phrase could be, "Even though I still feel a little bit of anger/sadness/depression about (name of situation), I choose to let it go now as this feeling/emotion no longer serves me."
