 Use about half of the potato chips and mix them with the mayonnaise, egg, green onions, parsley, coconut, and coriander. Fold in the crab meat last and incorporate them into the mixture.;
, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, as this allows the mixture to harden and would make it more efficient to shape.
 Roll the mixture into eight balls and gently flatten them with your palms, as if you are making hamburger patties. You don't want the patties too flat since they may break into pieces easier when cooking.
 Use the remaining 1/4 cup of potato chip crumbs and thoroughly coat both sides of each patty with it.
 Turn each patty over after two to three minutes, or as they begin to turn golden brown.
