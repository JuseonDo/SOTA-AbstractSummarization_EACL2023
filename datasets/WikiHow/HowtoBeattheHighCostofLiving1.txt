 If you have an extra room, try subletting for a few months of the year. In large cities, you can do this without taking on a roommate for a year lease.;
, If you get good reviews, you may get more business.
 If you find yourself working from home or employed by a flexible company, consider Arkansas, Texas or Tennessee. Look for the lowest cost of living with the best job prospects in your field.
 You may fall within the income threshold. Authorities suggest paying no more than 30 percent of your monthly paycheck on housing, otherwise you wonâ€™t be able to afford other necessities.
 By using the same company, you can get a discounted rate on all these necessary monthly expenses.
