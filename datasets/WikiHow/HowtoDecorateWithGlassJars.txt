 It's best to use multiple jars at a time, so it won't come off as pretty-ed up junk!;
, Paint is great, fabric is great too! Remember if you're using fabric or ribbon, get strong craft glue. Turning the jars into candles is a great idea too.
 Make a plan before continuing.
 Leave until completely dry.
 Then press gently onto the outside of the glass jar. Smooth out any air bubbles or glue pockets. Let dry for a few hours. After that, add anything from fabric stickers to strips of ribbon to customize.
 Is the jar going to hold food? Then paint the outside. If not, paint the inside.
 If painting the outside, use a good brush and apply two to three layers of your color of choice.
 Add a wick by using a tiny weight at the bottom, and remember to follow the instructions on the wax package.
, Clear glass jars as storage give a vintage look to kitchens.
