 Sit with your new dog and scoop some dog food into your hand. Put your hand in front of you. Let the dog come forward to close the remaining distance and eat from your hand. Continue to feed your dog the entire portion of food., Put your dog at ease while feeding your dog by speaking kindly to it. For instance, you might say, “You’re a good dog. Enjoy that delicious dog food.” Use a gentle, reassuring tone. These kind words will put your dog at ease while being fed., Once your dog is used to hand feeding, place the dog’s bowl in your lap and allow it to eat from the bowl. Hold the bowl steady with one hand and, while your dog is eating, use your other hand to apply a long body stroke.The long body stroke is a technique used to help reactive dogs relax around food.
To perform the long body stroke, pet your dog in a confident manner from the back of its neck to the base of its tail. Stroke the dog in a gentle but firm way.
Continue talking to your dog in a reassuring way while performing the long body stroke and allowing your dog to eat from the bowl in your lap.
 Every now and then (perhaps five or six times per week), drop a piece of cooked beef, chicken, or cheese into your reactive dog’s food bowl.This will help your dog associate your proximity to it and its food with good feelings and a positive outcome.
Continue to add little extras to your dog’s food for the first several months you have it at home.
