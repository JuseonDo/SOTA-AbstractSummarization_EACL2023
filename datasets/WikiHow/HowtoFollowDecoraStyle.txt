 Decora thrives on layers, which means having a full closet with lots of versatile items such as cardigans, hoodies, and tank tops.;
,, Stores such as Cute-plush.com, Asiajam.com and Cdjapan.co.jp are good staring points.
, It will look very incomplete.
 The more the better. You may buy some from www.lokisa.com, or many sellers on etsy.com sell adorable hair accessories.
 Wear a ton. Make sure they co-ordinate with the colors of your clothes.
 This is what really brings the Decora look together. In winter, layer t-shirts with sweaters, hoodies, and cute jackets. For the summer, stay cool while still looking cool and Decora by layering several tank tops with different cute colors and prints. Skirts are great for Decora because they can be layered well with tops, leggings, pants, and many other great items - try bright tulle skirts or colorful short skirts, layered with cute brightly colored leggings or stockings.
, Extreme Decora-chans will often wear many small toys from a belt or necklace so that they click together and make noise as you move. Backpacks and cute bags are also great, favorites are strawberry shaped purses or Pikachu backpacks.
 Try to find some colorful press-ons at a pharmacy or online.
 The main difference between a good and bad Decora is matching. Some people say mix and match, which is right, but keep a colour scheme, e.g. wear only blue or wear white with pink accessories, etc.
