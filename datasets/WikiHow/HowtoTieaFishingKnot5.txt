 It can be used for loop-to-loop connections or for tying hooks or other tackle to the line. The knot needs to be set pretty firmly after being tied, after which it won't slip.
 Create a simple loop about two inches from the end of the line.
, Place the end of the line across the front of the first loop, behind the running line. Pull the line until this second loop is a bit smaller than the first.
 Adjust it so that it's in between the large loop and small loop.
 Then, pass it over the middle loop and back up under top loop. Tighten the knot a bit.
 Secure the hook with pliers, and pull the line hard to tighten the whole rig.
