 With your free hand grasp the sides of the head with the thumb and forefinger.;
, Discard the head. With the hand that was holding the now discarded head, remove all of the legs in a single motion, this will assist in liberating the shell from the body of the prawn.
 If the Prawn was carrying eggs at the time it was caught, this could be a messy job. Pull the tail from the flesh of the prawn. If the previous steps have been performed correctly, the tail and the shell should fall way in one piece, without leaving any remnants of edible flesh in the tail section.
