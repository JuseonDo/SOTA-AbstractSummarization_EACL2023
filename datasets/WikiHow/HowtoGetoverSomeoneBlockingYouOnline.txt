 Just remember that it doesn't help if you have "cyber bullied" them or used profanity at them.;
, If they say that they didn't want you to bother them, just shrug and accept it. It's their choice on whether or not a person can communicate with them online.
, If they say no, then accept it. Then leave the door open and tell them that you are there if they ever decide to reverse their decision.
