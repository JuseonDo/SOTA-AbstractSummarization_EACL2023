 The damaged, infected leaves will never recover and removing them will make it easier for the baking soda solution or the chemicals to kill the mildew organisms.
 If this debris remains on the ground, it will become a hiding place for downy mildew and can re-infect the plants when the weather becomes humid and moist.Put all of the debris in the garbage to ensure the area around your plants is kept clean and free of any potential downy mildew.
 Doing this will prevent the growth of downy mildew as no water will be on the plant's leaves. Wet leaves or foliage makes it easier for downy mildew to thrive, especially when weather conditions are humid and moist.


Use a soaker hose or water the plants individually by hand with a watering can until temperatures warm.
