 You can either use white (Concord) grapes, which are the green ones, red grapes or purple grapes. You can also alternate. Note that the purple ones have seeds, and some red ones do, so keep this in mind if you're serving someone who doesn't like seeds.;
, You could use any of these:


Cantaloupe
Honeydew melon
Watermelon
Apples (any type)
Oranges (any type)
Bananas (chocolate-dipped ones are great, too)
Strawberries
Plums/prunes
Apricots, nectarines, tangerines, tangelos, clementines, etc. (fresh or dried)
Lemon
Lime
Pears (any type)
Pineapples

,,, Usually there's a grape on either end, and then a fruit, followed by a different fruit, followed by a grape, and so on. An example: grape, cantaloupe, grape, melon, grape, apricot, grape, plum, grape, apple, grape. If you're using different colors of grapes, you need to account for those, too.
