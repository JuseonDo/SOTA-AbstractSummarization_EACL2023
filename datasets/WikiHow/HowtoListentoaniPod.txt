, If you are using a shuffle, slide the switch at the top or back. If you have an iPod touch or iPhone, hold down the button at the top.
 Select this option by pressing the button in the center of your iPod.
 The iPod organizes your music alphabetically by artist, album and song. There are also separate sections for playlists (with the top 25 most listened to songs as one of the defaults) and podcasts.
 If you go by artist, you can either select the song by album or by going to a list of all the songs by the artist. If you go by song, songs will be listed alphabetically. If you go by album, you'll find an alphabetical list of album titles. Keep scrolling and until you arrive at the song you want (but don't push the button yet).
 You have to plug the headphones into a headphone jack. Put on the headphones/earbuds. Consult your manual, as different models of iPods place the headphone jacks in different locations.
 The iPod will keep going down the playlist until you have listened to all of the songs in that particular playlist.
 Turn it clockwise to turn the volume up and counter-clockwise to turn it down.
 You can turn the dots into star ratings by moving the scroll wheel on your iPod.
 Move the diamond using your navigation wheel to go forward or backward in the song.
