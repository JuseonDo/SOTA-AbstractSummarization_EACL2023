 Make sure your plan and gadgets work. Just don't go breaking into cars or houses, because you could get in trouble.


Some suggestions of who to spy on could be your parents, the weird guys and your neighbors. Just make sure that your "victim" is not somebody that you don't know: it could come back to bite you.

Never leave people out!

Commando
Private

At least 2 Nerf veterans.
