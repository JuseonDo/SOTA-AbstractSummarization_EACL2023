Getty Images is a large photo database associated with Google. It licenses photos to companies and websites.



Sign out of your Flickr account. View your profile when you are not signed in. There should be a "Request to License" link underneath your photos.
 If someone wants to license your photo, they will email you to ask if you want to accept the license and detail the terms.
 The decision is yours after you receive the email, although the price may not be up to you.
, This will help people to contact you or see your other work if they like your Flickr photos.
, You can arrange a sale of a photo license through your professional site and use your Flickr account to market and spread the word about your talent.



Unless you are using the Getty Images program, it is against the terms and conditions to sell your photos using this photo sharing program. Your account will be removed, if you do so.
