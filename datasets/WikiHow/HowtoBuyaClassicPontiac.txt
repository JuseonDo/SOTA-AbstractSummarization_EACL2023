Pontiacs were sold in the United States, Canada and Mexico by General Motors and were introduced in 1926. You may stumble across a predecessor vehicle named Pontiac made by Pontiac Spring & Wagon Works. They had a prototype ready in 1907, and had their first deliveries rolled out around 1908.
Prewar vehicles were known for being solid and quiet, but not necessarily strong.
