 Use scrap notebook paper as it's just a rough draft. Sketching on the computer using a program is a good idea as well.;
, Now use a blank white computer paper. If you have no large shaded regions, skip the next step.
 On this side, you will notice that the shaded regions have bled through. Re-color those shaded regions on this side, to give the logo an even shade. Flip the paper over.
 When done, go over the color areas again with the colored pencils. If you don't have a flatbed scanner, skip the next step.
, If you have a flatbed, place it face-down.
 If you don't need to scan it again before saving the image, skip the next step.
 Open up your raster image editor, and adjust your image until it looks nearly complete.
