 Coat a wire rack with non-stick cooking spray. Place the rack on top of a baking sheet.;
, Make sure you dry them well so that your Parmesan mixture sticks.
 Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
 Allow for some space between pieces, but place them close enough together so you can easily sprinkle the zucchini with the dry mixture.
 Use a baking brush to brush an even coat of oil onto each piece, or you can simply drizzle the oil over the zucchini.
 Disperse the cheese mixture evenly so each piece receives the same amount of coating.
 Then turn your oven to broil and cook the zucchini for another two or three minutes. Keep an eye on the zucchini so it doesn't burn!

, Sprinkle with parsley and accompany the dish with a dipping sauce such as marinara or ranch.
