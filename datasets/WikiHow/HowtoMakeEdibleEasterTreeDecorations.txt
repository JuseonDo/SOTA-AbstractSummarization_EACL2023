 This will likely depend on what cookie cutters you have available but you can also cut around cardboard templates, although this is more painstaking. Typical designs would include eggs, bunnies, chicks and lambs.


If you don't have the right shapes, you can always make in your own cookie cutters.;
, Make sure it is an even thickness. Use flour on the board to help prevent the dough sticking.
,, Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack. Use the skewer to fix any holes that have closed up during the baking.
 To color sugar paste, place the desired amount into a small plastic bag and add the coloring to the bag.
 Use the same cutters that you have used to make the cookies. Cut out as many shapes as you have cookies needing decorating.
 Press the sugar paste shape onto the cookie. Repeat for each cookie. Remember to pierce the hole through the sugar paste as well.
 Add small dots, stars, lines, etc. to give the cookies facial features or patterns.
, Cut lengths of ribbon that are about 25cm/10". Thread the ribbon through the hole in the cookie and tie onto the Easter tree. Repeat for each cookie.
