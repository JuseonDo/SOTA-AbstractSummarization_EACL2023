 You can work on a study plan based on how much time you have for preparation. Ideally you’ll need at least a couple of months. Also ensure that you schedule the test allowing time to re-take it if needed.;
,,,, There are many, so read some reviews and browse around a bookstore until you find one you like.
 Do not let anything or anyone disturb you during that time.
, You have to get used to sitting and testing for over four hours so you won’t be in for any surprises on the day of the test.
 You will find many practice questions.
 Track your success with another test taking friend to keep yourself going if you are the kind of person that needs an extra push.
 A well-rested body and mind has the capability to learn and retain more information.
 Have confidence in yourself; take breaks in between study times and enjoy the entire process.
