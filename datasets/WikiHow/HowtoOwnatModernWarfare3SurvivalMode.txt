remember to take cover a lot.

@summary
if you are playing solo, always get as many self-revives as possible because if you are hurt, there will be no-one to cover you, so if you go down, at least you'll have a second chance to get back up again.

flash bang the juggernauts, it stuns them for around 4-5 seconds and allows you to run/fire/reload.

@summary
pick up ammo dropped by enemies if you have the same weapon, this makes purchasing the acr or ak-47 a solid move as it is a good all around weapon and the enemies you kill will provide ammunition (ak after level 10, acr after 15.

@summary
save up for a grenade turret, protect it with claymore and it will help you get to later rounds.

 Save up so that you can replace them with better weapons. Don't buy anything except ammo until all the 'access laptops' are unlocked.;
, If you are looking to be someone who gets a lot of cash, try to get a semi-auto shotgun like the Striker, AA12 or the USAS12. Or, if you are looking to get rapid kills, try getting an assault rifle like the ACR, M4(A1) or the M16(A4).
 You don't have to get something like a machine pistol, a handgun or others. You can get whatever weapon combinations you like. This is a big help because you can be someone who can get a lot of points and get rapid kills at the same time.
 Be wise on this one, because, like MW2 and BO, you can only have 2 attachments per weapon. Unfortunately, the Model 1887 and the pistols cannot have attachments.
 Get a care package, pick it up, get either riot shield support or Delta squad and call them in when you are in 'ready up mode' and get either a predator missile or an AC130 strike. Use a predator missile to take out large moving groups of enemies and using an AC130 strike on a juggernaut, 1/2 of a second after it's landed.
 If you don't take cover, enemies will kill you before you can even die.

Explosives are helpful against juggernauts, claymores and c4 do a lot of damage against them and can make things easier by cutting down on the waves of enemies.



It is difficult to last a long time in the game unless you have more firepower than the enemy and this means buying a good weapon instead of scavenging if you have the money

, Hide it from helicopters as they will destroy it.
