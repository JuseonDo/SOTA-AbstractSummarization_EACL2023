 It helps to choose a convenient number of stitches to repeat, such as 10.;
, Use curved lines as needed - the design is free-flowing at this stage.
 Use an eraser to remove any errors until you are happy with the design.
 Follow the most obvious graph squares and put a cross in each square that permits outlining and infill of your design.
, If you find that the spacing between the motifs is too great, for example, 6 stitches or more, add a fill-in pattern between each motif. Suitable fill-ins can be lines, crosses, shapes, V's, etc. Their purpose is to reduce the number of stitches a color has to carry across the back.
 This might seem like extra work, but it is worth it to see whether or not the motif will work. Knit a 30-stitch sampler. If it works, great - go ahead. If not, back to the drawing board.
 Samplers can be used for small craft projects such as pin cushions, doll's clothing, etc.
