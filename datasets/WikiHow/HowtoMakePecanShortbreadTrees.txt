, Beat in vanilla (not the baking chips) and the food coloring. On low speed, beat in flour just until mixed. Stir in the chopped pecans., 4 equal parts = 4 balls). Place 2 of them on each cookie, on opposite ends. With a rolling pin (or floured fingers, either one comes with the same results), gently flatten and shape each ball into a 6-inch circle., Poke the tops of the wedges with a fork, and place 1 pecan half in the middle of each outer edge to make a "tree trunk"., While it's still warm, cut the wedges into smaller wedges. When it's done baking, let them cool on the cookie sheets for 30 minutes., Place the baking chips in a small resealable freezer plastic bag. Microwave them on High for 40-60 seconds/1 minute, turning the bag over after 30 seconds., Cut a small tip of a corner of the bag, and drizzle sideways (see photo in introduction) over the wedges to make a tree garland., Top each tree with a star.,
