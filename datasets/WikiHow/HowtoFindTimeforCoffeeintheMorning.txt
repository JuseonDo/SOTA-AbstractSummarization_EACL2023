 Put a filter and the amount of ground coffee you need in the coffee maker. Pour in the amount of water you'll need as well.;
, Place it in a handy location with a spoon for mixing, so it is easy to pour the freshly brewed coffee into the cup or mug the next morning.
, It's nice to put your sugar in before you coffee anyway, since the hot liquid will dissolve it quickly.
 Alternately, check your coffee maker's manual to see if you have a delay brew or timer option. If so you can set your coffee machine to start on its own before or right when you wake up.
, Voila! You are out the door, coffee in hand, with little extra time.
