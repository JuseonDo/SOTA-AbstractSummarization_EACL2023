 Scroll down to the filter of your choice. Select that filter.


Filters that are often included in Adobe Illustrator software editions include: fresco, colored pencils, stylize, film grain, glowing edges, blur and watercolor.
 This may include choosing the amount of filter you want to use out of a percentage of 100.


For example, if you have chosen to use the Sharpen Filter, you will choose what percentage you want Illustrator to sharpen the contrast of the different elements of the graphic, image or text.
 Click "OK" to make the changes to your object.


Although you may want to experiment with the gradient, unlike effects, once filters are saved, they have changed the image and cannot be undone.
