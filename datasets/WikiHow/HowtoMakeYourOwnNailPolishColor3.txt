 This method is purely experimental and you are warned that it can result in some unusable colors. However, once you're good at experimenting in this way, you'll find it's a fun way of creating totally new color ranges.
 For example, dollar store nail polish can work for this experiment, at least until you're better at guessing which colors mix together nicely. Since it's so cheap, purchase a few colors, to allow you to experiment more broadly.
, Use the nail polish brush to mix.









Do you like the color that forms? If yes, make more. If not, try a different amount of polish or a different color combination.
 Label it clearly so that you remember it's your own creation.


It can be useful to keep a record of which polish colors you've combined, especially if you wish to recreate the polish when this one runs out.
