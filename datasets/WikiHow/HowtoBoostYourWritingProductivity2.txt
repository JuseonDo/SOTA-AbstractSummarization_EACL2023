 If you feel as though you might need added accountability, let your friends or family know what goals you’ve set for yourself. Be sure that your goals aren’t too lofty. For example, don’t make a goal that you will write for eight consecutive hours a day. Instead, you might decide that your goal is to write one page a day, or that you’ll write for two hours a day.
 You might choose to make your unit of measurement hours, the number of words written, or the number of projects completed. This chart will enable you to see what your writing productivity looks like over a specific period of time.
 However, if you break the project down into smaller components, the project will seem much less daunting.For example, if you plan to write a 3,000 word essay, tell yourself that you will write the essay over the course of three days and on each day you will write 1,000 words.
 This will help to motivate you to write. For instance, if you want to play your guitar, tell yourself that you can do this after you’ve finished composing your 1,000 word goal for the day and hold yourself to it.
