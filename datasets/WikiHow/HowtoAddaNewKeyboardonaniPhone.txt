 You can do this by tapping the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
,,,,,, Some languages will have multiple keyboard layout options available.


For example, tapping "English (Japan)" will present you with QWERTY, AZERTY, and QWERTZ options.
 You can find the App Store icon on one of your Home screens. Third-party keyboards like SwiftKey and Gboard need to be installed from the App Store before they can be selected.
 You'll see this at the bottom of the screen.
,, Note that not all available keyboards will be displayed here. If you're looking for a specific keyboard and aren't finding it, tap the Search tab and search for it.
,, Return to the Home screen and tap the Settings app to open your Settings menu.
,,,,,,, This will allow the keyboard to access your typing history, which it will need to use predictive text.
 Make sure you trust the developer before enabling this option. Generally you should stick to keyboards from known and trusted companies like SwiftKey and Google.


You won't need to enable this if you just want basic functionality from the keyboard.
 This can be any app, such as Messages or Mail.
 Your keyboard will need to be on the screen in order to switch to a new one.
 You'll find this to the left of the Space bar. This button only appears if there are at least two keyboards installed.
 You'll see a list of available languages appear when you hold the Globe button. Third-party keyboards will be at the bottom of the list.
 Your keyboard will change to match the language's input method, and predictive text will change to the selected language.


If you select a third-party keyboard, your regular keyboard will disappear and the third-party one will appear after a moment.
