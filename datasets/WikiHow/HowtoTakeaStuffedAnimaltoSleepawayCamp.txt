 This will give your pal a special space for all of his or her stuff, and will ensure your stuff doesn't get mixed up with your stuffie's. Since your stuffed animal won't need very much stuff, the bag doesn't have to be very big. A small tote bag will do.;
, Look through your packing list and get your stuffed animal's input on decisions. Not sure if you should wear that shirt with the pants or the skirt? Ask your stuffed animal!

, Some stuffed animals want to change clothes frequently, and some don't wear clothes at all. Don't give a stuffed animal who changes clothes daily one pair, and don't give stuffed animal who doesn't wear clothes twenty outfits.
If you don't sleep with your stuffed animal, sleeping supplies, like blankets, pillow, etc.
Plastic food in case your stuffed animal gets hungry.
A brush if your stuffed animal has long fur.
A washcloth
Other things your stiffed animal wants, like a favorite book, a picture from home, etc.
 Would you like it if you were stuck in a dark place with barely enough room to breathe? If you are traveling with strangers and are embarrassed, put your buddy in a drawstring bag with all your entertainment for the ride there.
 Do you both like beds by the window? Get one by the window! You both like top bunk? Get top bunk!

,, It's probably not a good idea to take him or her swimming, but your friend might enjoy a hike!

,, Tell your friend the name of a tree you pass by, teach him or her how to knit, anything you've learned at camp!

, Have a play date during free time or rest time and get as many campers as you can to bring their stuffed animals.
 Have a part of the letter where your stuffed animal can say something! Maybe your stuffed animal misses the other stuffed animals. Have him or her write a letter to them! Since stuffed animals can't write, be the scribe.
 Are you homesick? Cuddle with your stuffed animal! If your stuffed animal gets homesick, give him/her a big hug.
