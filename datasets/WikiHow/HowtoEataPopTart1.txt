 Lots of people like to eat their pop tarts at room temperature, and that is perfectly fine. They are already baked, so they are safe to eat without heating.
 Many of the dessert flavors, such as Cookies & Creme, Hot Fudge Sundae, and Frosted Chocolate Chip, taste great this way. Simply place the entire bag in the freeze overnight, and enjoy it the next morning.
