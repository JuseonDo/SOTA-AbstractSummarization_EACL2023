 If you can't get any fresh lemons, you can use bottled lemon juice (not lemonade) instead; you will need 1Â½ cups (350 milliliters) of bottled lemon juice.,, Save the rest of the lemonade for more servings or for another recipe. For best results, use good quality ice cream, and not the "frozen dessert" kind., Make sure that the ice cream is evenly mixed throughout the lemonade. There should be not streaks or swirls.
 At this point, you can use the rest of the chilled lemonade to made more frozen lemonade. Remember, you will need 4 scoops of ice cream for every cup (240 milliliters) of chilled lemonade.


For an added touch, garnish the frozen lemonade with some whipped cream or a sprinkle of lemon zest.
