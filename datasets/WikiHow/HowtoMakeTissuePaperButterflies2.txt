 It should be almost the same size as the paper. Also, make sure that the body of the butterfly is aligned with folded part of the paper. This makes the outer part of your frame.


Use a white crayon or colored pencil so that you can see the line easily.
You can make up your own butterfly, or find a template online to use., Keep the folded while you cut. This way, when you unfold your paper, your butterfly will look the same on both sides.
 The wings should be hollow. This will make the inner part of the frame.


If you'd like your butterfly to have a solid/black body, only cut out inside the wings. Don't extend the frame to the fold.
 Cut a sheet of contact paper a little bit bigger than the butterfly. Peel off the backing, and set it down on the table, sticky-side-up. Place the butterfly frame down onto the contact paper., Make them between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Use lots of different colors to make your butterfly look more interesting. You can even cut some of the squares into rectangles inside.
 The tissue paper will stick to the contact paper, so you don't have to use any glue. This will create the stained glass effect.


If you cut out a hollow body, stick the tissue paper onto there as well.
 Make sure that the contact paper is large enough to cover the entire butterfly. Peel off the backing, and slowly place it over the butterfly, going from one side to the next. Smooth it down with your hands or a ruler to seal it.
 Leave a ¼ -inch (0.64 centimeters) boarder of contact paper around the butterfly to seal it in and keep it from coming apart.
 Punch a hole through one of the wings, and thread a piece of thread through it. Tie the thread into a loop, and hang it someplace where the light will shine through it.You can also tape the butterfly to a window if you won't want to punch a hole through its wings.
The side with the black outline is the front, and the tissue paper side is the back.
