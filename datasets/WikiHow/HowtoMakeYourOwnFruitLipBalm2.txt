 Berries, such as raspberries and strawberries, will give you the best color, however.


You can grin the fruit using a coffee grinder, or a mortar and pestle.
 Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a heat-safe bowl on top. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the surface of the water. Try to use a glass bowl, as those heat more evenly than metal.
 The beeswax is not necessary, but it will help give your lip balm a firmer texture and make it less gooey. If you do decide to use beeswax, try to get it in flake or pellet form. It will melt quicker and easier. If you can't get beeswax in flake or pellet form, shave it using a cheese grater.
 Stir them from time to time to ensure that they melt evenly. Both ingredients will turn somewhat clear when they melt.
 Use a pair of oven mitts to handle the bowl, as it will be very hot.
 Keep stirring until everything is evenly mixed together. There should be no streaks, lumps, or swirls. If you plan on using different types of fruit for different flavors, separate your melted mixture into smaller bowls first, then add the powdered fruit.
 Work quickly, as the lip balm will start to set fast.
 Once in the fridge, the lip balm will finish setting and harden.
