 Locate the SugarSync app on your iOS device. It’s the app with a green hummingbird. Tap on it to launch it.


If you don’t have the app yet, open the App Store and search for SugarSync there. From the list of results, find the correct app and tap the “Install” button beside it to download it on your device. Once installed, tap the app to launch it.
 Tap the “Log In” button found at the bottom of the screen, and you will be brought to the Login screen. Enter your SugarSync account and password then tap the “Log In” button to access your account.
 You will see all your computers and devices where SugarSync is running once you log in.
 Browse through the folders until you find the folder to share.
 This will bring out the toolbar.
 A Share screen will appear with your selected folder.
 These people will need SugarSync accounts in order to join your shared folder.
 Do this in the space provided.


This step is optional.
 You can set the access level to “View Only” or “Add & Edit.”


If you set it to View Only, your recipients can only see your folder and its contents.
If you set it to Add & Edit, they will be able to manage the files similar to how you do.
 An email will be sent to your recipients inviting them to join your shared folder.
