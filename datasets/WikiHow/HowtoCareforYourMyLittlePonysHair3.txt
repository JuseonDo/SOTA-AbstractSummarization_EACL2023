@summary
as always, wash your pony.

@summary
brush your pony's hair while it's still a little damp, and then divide the mane into four equal strips.

@summary
divide the tail into strips as well.

@summary
wrap each strip of hair around a straw, beginning at the end of the hair, and spiraling up the straw as you go, so that the curls will coil downward.

@summary
follow the same procedure for the tail, wrapping the curls from the bottom upward.

@summary
leave your pony to dry overnight.
@article
 Be sure to use conditioner, and to rinse out as much of it as possible afterward. This makes the hair soft and shiny, and helps it to hold its shape. Use a towel to dry the pony until her hair is only a little damp. Now you're ready to begin.
 If you have a pony with multiple hair colors, it will look best to divide the strips by color.
 Separating colors in the tail is less important than in the mane, but if you choose to take the time to do it, your pony will look even better.
 Fix the hair in place with a bobby pin or a small hair clip.
, In the morning, you can unclip the hair and carefully pull out the straws. If the curls seem a little stiff, just squeeze them lightly between your fingers. Don't worry if the curls seem a bit tight; they'll loosen within a few hours, and you'll have a pony with shiny, beautiful ringlets. Depending on the texture of your pony's hair, these curls may stay in for weeks, or even months!
