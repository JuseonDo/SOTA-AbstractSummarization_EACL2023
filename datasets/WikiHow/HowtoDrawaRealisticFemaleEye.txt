@summary
draw a long, slightly curved line.

@summary
draw another one below, more intensely curved.

@summary
add another intensively curved line, this is the top eyelid.

@summary
,

@summary
draw the "circle" of the eye, this consists of the iris (the outer ring) and the pupil (the black in the middle).

@summary
draw the eyelashes.

@summary
draw the baseline for the eyebrow.

@summary
add two circles - one on the iris and one on the pupil, to achieve the effect of the light reflection.

@summary
add another short, curved line below and left of the inner corner, this is the line of the nose.

@summary
,

@summary
now fill in the eyebrow, using a great number of short, curved motions; this way it will look like actual hair.

@summary
if you want to make your eye look like it has makeup applied, color the top eyelid (eyeshadow effect), and darken the edges just below the eyelashes (eyeliner effect).

@article
 This is the top edge of the eye.;
, This is the bottom edge and these lines should be connected at one corner. This corner is the outer corner of the eye. These lines at the inner corner must be slightly parted.
, Mind this detail: the iris isn't completely shown; it is partially covered by the eyelid, this gives the sense of depth.
 Keep in mind, you must draw them on the edges of both eyelids, more on the bottom than on the top. Try to keep the same distance between them and make them approximately under the same angle. Draw the top eyelashes longer than the bottom.
 It should begin a bit before the inner corner and end at the end of the outer corner. Make it as angled as you want. A more distinct angle opens the eye more, but also gives the "fake cosmetics" kind of look, so try to achieve a balance (unless you're drawing elves, this is where intense angles are very welcome).
 These can be as near each other or as far apart as you like.
, It should thin out as you advance toward the outer corner. (This one turned out ugly, though x.x) Color the pupil and the iris, leaving the previously drawn circles white (light reflection). Please notice the color of the iris grows darker while moving upwards; this is because the top eyelid casts a shadow on it.
