 One of the bowls will be used for washing the jewelry, while the other one will be used for rinsing it. Make sure that the bowls you are using are large enough to completely submerge the jewelry.;
,, This is a must for cleaning jewelry, especially if it has any gemstones, as it will prevent scratches.Try to use a microfiber cloth; it is soft, non-abrasive, and lint-free.
 Be sure to go along the grain, not across it.If you rub across the grain lines, you risk scratching your jewelry.
 Again, go with the grain, not across it. Also, be sure to use gentle pressure, and not to scrub too hard. Avoid scrubbing any gemstones, however, or you will risk scratching them.
 Gently bob the jewelry up and down to get rid of any soap residue. If necessary, pour the dirty water out, and replace it with fresh water. Keep rinsing the jewelry until there is no soap residue left.
 If you leave any water behind, you might get some water spots.


If your jewelry has a lot of details in it, wrap it up in the cloth and wait a few minutes. This will give the cloth some time to soak up the excess water.
 Make sure that the polish you are using is labeled safe for stainless steel. Do not use silver polish, as it will stain your jewelry. When polishing the jewelry, make sure that you are going with the grain, and not across it.
