 These sorts of tumors generally show up in between who are between the ages of 40 and 60. However, it is good to keep in mind that lipoma can show up at any age, there’s just a higher risk of developing one of these tumors after you pass the age of 40.
 There are a few health issues that can increase your chances of developing lipoma. The health issues that are generally linked to lipoma include:


Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome.
Madelung syndrome.
Adiposis dolorosa.
Cowden syndrome.
Gardner syndrome.
 Studies show that there is a link between your genetic heritage (the health conditions of your family members) and your own health.If your grandmother had lipoma, it is very possible that you will also develop it because you share your grandmother’s genes.
 Lipoma, as mentioned above, is the rapid growth of fat cells in a certain location. But slim, fit people develop them too. When you are obese, you have a lot more fat cells than the average person, making it more likely that those extra fat cells will come together and form a lipoma tumor.
 People who participate in contact sports where they get repeatedly hit in the same spot have a higher chance of developing lipoma tumors. If you get him in the same spot over and over again, make sure to really protect that area next time.
