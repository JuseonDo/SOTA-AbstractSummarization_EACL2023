Leave the neck banding intact, or cut away it away along the seams. You could also cut the neck into a wider boat neck or into a "V" neckline.






Draw your neckline ideas onto the sweatshirt and check the drawing for symmetry before executing your ideas.



Leave the center intact for a more "sweater vest" look.



Use your scissors' tips to snip a small entrance cut at the seam between the sweatshirt and its arm.






Cut around the seam until you remove the arm completely; repeat the process with the remaining arm.
