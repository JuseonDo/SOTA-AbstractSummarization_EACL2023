 Free open source editing software Audacity is used in this example. Most other audio editors and DAWs have similar features and support for editing MP3 files.

Click the “Trim” button to keep only the selected region and cut the rest of the audio.
Click the “Silence” button to silence the selected region of audio without deleting it from the timeline.

You cannot save it as an .mp3 file with the free version.
