 Are you going to a convention, or are you hanging out casually with cosplay buddies? Check the date, and give yourself at least two or more moths to get this cosplay.;
,, Look up images of them and take careful notice of what they wear. This is including accessories, jewelry, and shoes. Find the best picture and use it as a reference.
 Look up as many as you can, because a good site can be difficult to hunt down.
 Don't forget to check shipping prices! Some costumes seem cheap, but with shipping they end up super expensive.
 Make sure most if not all details are accurate.
 Sometimes you end up with a terrible costume because the site or seller itself is unreliable.
 It depends on which you value most.
 I suggest using a wig because you can wear the costume whenever you want and it is generally more convenient.
 You also probably want a wig cap, which you can get for a few dollars at a party store. This keeps your hair in place and out of site while wearing the wig.
