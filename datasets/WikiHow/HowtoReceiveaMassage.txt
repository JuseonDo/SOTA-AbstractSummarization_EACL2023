before the massage, a hot sauna or shower, if possible is nice.

lie on the table, and be aware of your breathing.

as the therapist moves the sheet to work on a part of your body, don't move for them or hold limbs up as they secure the sheet.

think of your massage not just as one artist doing his or her job but two artists - you and the therapist - working together.

 There will be a sheet covering your body. The therapist only pulls away the part of the sheet of the part of the body they are massaging. Be suspicious if they want to force you to strip.;
, Hot water, especially steam, tends to loosen up the muscles and prepares the skin.
 Do two or three deep breaths and exhalations when you lie down. These should be slow in and a little faster on the exhale.
 Silence is another gift which can have an immeasurable impact on your peacefulness. When the therapist is pushing down on muscle, let the air out of your lungs in time with the pressure. Breathe in as the therapist pulls back his or her pressure.
 A properly trained therapist will not need your help and the tension inhibits your relaxation.
 A dance. Be involved and aware of the touch and pressure. Do your part to breathe into and out of the massage. Once you know your therapist, the two of you can develop an intuitive and autonomic partnership of your muscles almost rising to meet the pressure and your therapist's hands and arms knowing exactly when to push, press, rub or tap.
