 You can use Single User Mode to reset the administrator password for your Mac in case you have forgotten it. You don't need administrator access to perform this procedure.
 If you continue to hold these keys as the computer boots, you will be taken to the command line.
 This will scan your hard drive for errors, which may take a few minutes. It is required in order to proceed.
 This allows you to make changes to the filesystem.
 You can change the password for any user account by entering the user account name instead of "Administrator".
 You'll be prompted to enter your new password and then enter it again to confirm it. You won't see the password as you're typing.
 This will reboot your computer and load OS X as normal. Your Administrator account will now use the new password.
