 You may have to scroll down to find it.
 The Chrome Privacy menu will open.
 You'll see a list of the types of items that can be deleted.
 This will ensure that any entries you've typed into search fields are deleted.


You can uncheck other items that you may want to keep, such as browsing history and cached images and files.
 This will tell Chrome to delete every stored entry it has saved.
 Your search box entries will be completely deleted.
 If you want to get rid of a single entry without deleting your entire history, you can do it manually:


Tap the field that contains the search you want to get rid of. You may need to type a few letters from the search to make it appear.
Press and hold on the search in the suggestions list that you want to delete.
Confirm that you want to remove the entry.
