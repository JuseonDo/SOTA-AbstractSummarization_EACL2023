 For best results, pre-measure the toilet roll and mark where you will cut. Consider marking each roll before cutting to expedite the process.
 Hold the two ovals together with your thumb and index finger and then add a dab of Tacky Glue between the two.


Slide a hair clip over the ovals and hold until completely dry.
, Place a dab of glue along the base of each set and pin together. Hold and allow to dry.



Add flourish to the ends of the sculpture by cutting one oval in half. Run the side of your scissors along the inside of the roll to create a small curl. Attach the rounded edge to the sculpture and allow the curl to hang off the side.
 Allow sculpture to dry overnight.
 Coat the sides and insides of the ovals with paint and consider applying two coats.


Allow for ample dry time before hanging sculpture. Check the paint can directions for appropriate time.
