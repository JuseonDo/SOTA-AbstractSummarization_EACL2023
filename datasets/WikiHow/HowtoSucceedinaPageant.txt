 Be sure to write everything neatly and BE HONEST. Judges use applications to create questions for the interview (if there is one) and on-stage questions. It's much better to seem boring than to seem like a liar!;
, It doesn't need to be super expensive or fancy. Just something that you look good in.
 Practice good posture and smiling. Become conscious of what your body looks like in certain positions and find the best ones. You can even create your own routine if one isn't already choreographed to help yourself from posing awkwardly onstage. Most stages are rectangular or "T" shaped(the point closest to the judges) and follow the "T" shaped walk. Turn at the points and in the middle and smile. Don't be too stiff.
, If you are confused about how you should look, go to the pageant's website and look at the pictures of past winners to use as a guide.
