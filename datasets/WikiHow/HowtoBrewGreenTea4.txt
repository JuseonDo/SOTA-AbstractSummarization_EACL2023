, Or you can just microwave a cup of water. The boiled water should be "first boil" (see the boiling instructions under "Brewing loose green tea in a teapot" for more details).
,, Or, if preferred, you can leave the tea bag in the mug or you can remove the tea bag before enjoying your drink. It's your choice.
