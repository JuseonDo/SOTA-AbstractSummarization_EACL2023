 If you don't have apple cider, you can use plain apple juice instead. You will have to add some spices later on to give your juice more flavor, however.
 Make sure that you are using plain, canned pumpkin puree and not the "pumpkin pie" kind. The pumpkin pie puree has lots of additional ingredients and your juice won't turn out right., If you can't find any, you can use peach nectar instead. This will help thin out your juice without sacrificing flavor. Avoid just adding more apple cider or apple juice; the apple flavor will be too overwhelming., If you used plain apple juice, this is a must. If you are using apple cider, however, then you don't have to add it, because it is already spiced., From time to time, you may have to pause the blender, and scrape the mixture down the sides with a spatula. This will ensure that everything blends evenly., This pumpkin juice will be a little thick, like orange juice or apricot/peach nectar. It won't be thin and clear like apple juice. Make your adjustments based on the list below, and give your pumpkin juice a final blend.

If the juice is not sweet enough, add some agave nectar, honey, white sugar, or brown sugar.
If the pumpkin juice is too bland, add a little bit more pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon.
 This will help improve the flavor of the juice. It will also allow the flavors to infuse better., For an added touch, you could design some "Pumpkin Juice" labels on your computer, print them onto adhesive paper, and stick them onto some glass bottles. Pour the pumpkin juice into these bottles, and enjoy it that way!
