 Fold around the length of two of your fingers, to help you can put your fingers on the left or right, and fold with them in between until you have used all.;
, To make sure it is secure, tape the end of the paper folds, the ends, and where the paper can't go any more.This will make sure it won't fall.
 The top should look like a loop.
 Then tape it, still keeping the space of the loop.
 Keep it to one side.
 Fold it from bottom to top, leaving the space of two fingers.
 Put in two pens––the length of the pen will be the front of your gun.
, This should be the amount that has no pen in it.
 The amount of the cut-off bit will be how much the loom band stretches.
 This is to make a rest for the loom band to go on when it stretches from the cut-off bit near the handle.
, Do not place it further than the rest, the cut-off bit near the handle.
 Stretch it back, over the trigger, until you reach the other rest. Rest it, then pull back the trigger.
 Once you have reached the other rest, pull back a bit more and shoot! The loom band should disappear as it fires away.
