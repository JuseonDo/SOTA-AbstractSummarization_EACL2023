 You can either shell them yourself, if you have the time, or buy them already shelled.;
, It depends on individual taste and the intended use for toasted pecans.



If keeping toasted pecans for snacking, you might want to salt before storing in an airtight container.
If you plan on adding any other seasonings when you toast nuts, the butter will help the seasonings stick.
You can also toast nuts with cooking oil.
Toasting pecans dry is another option, but watch out for over-drying.
