help around the house.

@summary
be nicer to them, so they can see that you're at least trying to be different.

@summary
sit your parents down to have a serious talk.

@summary
you'll have to listen a lot, too.

@summary
once they're done, start off by saying, "mom, dad, i get what you're saying and i agree...." if, at that last word, they faint, or ask you whether you're high, don't give up.

@summary
tell them you understand their concerns about your career and future.

@summary
mention to them how you regret not having paid attention in class before.

@summary
tell them, at the end of your talk ,that you got your grades, and they were really no good....tell them you sincerely see your mistake in letting your grades slip down, and that you'll work on it.
@article
 Offer to do small things like cleaning the dishes, setting the table, washing the car...They'll be suspicious at first, but chill. If you flash a smile at them, they'll freak out even more. Remember: known teenage trouble-makers are NOT supposed to smile.;
, Don't yell at your dad to get the door when the bell rings and you're playing Black Ops. Don't scream your lungs off when your mom feels brave enough to come into your room to help you clean up.
 This has to involve blunt honesty on your part ("Yes, dad, I was in detention again that day") and superhuman levels of patience ("Yes, mom, I know I don't apply myself.").
 Parents usually don't feel like they're getting through to their kids, so make sure you don't just nod and grunt. Blurt in a few non-rebellious words, and let them do most of the talking.
 That's just parental defense mechanism.
 Assure them that your dearest dream, contrary to their expectations, is NOT to live in a doghouse. Be down to earth, and discuss your career options. Parents are usually a lot smarter than they let on, and they can help you out a lot.
 They will feel sympathetic, even if they don't let it on. Your parents aren't a pair of sleeping beauties, they would know that your behavior reflects your grades. Don't treat this as some master manipulation trick to gain their sympathy- realize that if you don't pull up your socks now, you're doomed.
 They'll be furious that you flunked straight-out, but at least this way, they're prepared in advance.
