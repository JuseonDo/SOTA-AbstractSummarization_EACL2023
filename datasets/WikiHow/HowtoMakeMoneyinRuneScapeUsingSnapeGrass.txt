 Speak to Peer the Seer. He says he can perform a magic spell which teleports your items to the bank for free.;
, Tell him you want to go with him to Waterbirth Island. Pay him 1,000 GP.
, Start picking them up until you have a full inventory. Know that it takes a few seconds for them to respawn on a populated world.
 Deposit the grass there. If you have activated the Lodestone Network there, it's the best advantage to go with. If you did not, travel to Relleka and deposit your items with Peer the Seer.
 This teleport is achieved if a person has completed the Lunar Diplomacy quest.
