 You can either wear it underneath a dress or shirt and pants or tuck it away nicely in your bag to slip on once you have arrived at your destination.;
, Select a wide-brimmed hat. The color doesn't have to exactly match your swimwear, but it's cute if it does. Just make sure it's wide so it blocks most of the sun and protects your eyes. Floppy hats are so chic and stylish!

, Pretty feet are a must whenever you are venturing out wearing a nice bikini. Pick a color that matches your bikini so it will look cute.
 Make sure they are comfortable and you can walk in them in the sand or on rocks if you choose to go sightseeing.
 It's basically up to you on which ones you want to bring. Darker sunglasses will reflect more sunlight, so if it's a really sunny day, wear those.
 Use them to block the sun's ultraviolet rays. It helps protect against sunburn. Make sure you pick out a brand with a high SPF (Sun Protection Factor). You can also bring along a bottle of aloe vera to rub on your skin to help keep it moisturized. Bring a tube of lip balm wouldn't be a bad idea either.
 It's a sheer or cotton piece of fabric that you can use to tie around your waist while you are walking around in your micro or Brazilian bikini. It makes you feel less exposed. Bikini cover ups come in many different styles. Some styles, such as sundresses, can even be worn off the beach!

, Keep it simple and don't over-do it!

, If you really enjoy getting into the water, make sure you bring along a few hair ties to keep your hair out of your face.
 It only takes a few moments to get together all of the items that you'll need to make your beach-going experience more enjoyable. Have fun.
