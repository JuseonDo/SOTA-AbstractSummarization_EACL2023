@summary
before you decide to work in a club, google your area and look at the websites of the clubs in the area you want to work.

@summary
once you have a shortlist of clubs, rope a male friend if possible (lucky him!),

@summary
when you are at the club.

@summary
talk to the girls and ask them if they like working in the club and if they have been working there long.

@summary
find out what the audition process is and go for an audition to get a real good feel for the place.

@summary
if you are already working in a club, before you jump ship, visit another club and work there for one night.

 If you know an area is dangerous or rough, be careful and have your warning signal up. If possible stick to clubs in good areas or in city centres which will attract a good quality of customer. Also look at what the club charges for entrances, drinks and dances on their website. This will give you a really good idea of what calibre of customer the club attracts.;
, and go visit the club as a customer. This will give you a really good insight into what the club will be like.
 Look to see if it is well managed and looks safe. Do the girls look happy working there? Do the bouncers look like they have presence and are looking after the girls? Do the customers look like they are behaving themselves?

, Long term girls mean that the club is keeping them happy. It is a really good sign.
 Ask about what the club charges in house fees and TIPS. This adds up, but do not be afraid if the charges are high. It has usually been found that the clubs which charge higher can sustain that as the girls working there can earn more because of higher charges and a better customer base.
 You may be surprised to find you are better off where you are OR you may want to move. Always try it first. Loyalty in a club and who you work with can count for a lot.
