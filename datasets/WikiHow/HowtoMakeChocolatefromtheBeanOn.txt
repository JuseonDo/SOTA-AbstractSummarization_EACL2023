 Roast for 5 minutes at 400 °F (204 °C), and then for 5-10 minutes on 250 °F (121 °C). At first, the smell will be very acidic and vinegary, but when your kitchen smells like brownies you know the beans are done! Take the beans out and let them cool.
 Seal the bag and crush the beans with a cast-iron skillet or rolling pin. Don't be gentle; the hull (outside) of the bean needs to be separated from the nib (yummy inside)., Agitate the bowl slightly, either by stirring with your hands or shaking the bowl. IF you have to hairdryer at the right distance, the hulls will fly right out of the bowl! Check the nibs carefully to make sure the hulls are completely removed., A 100 gram batch of 60% dark chocolate requires 60 grams of nibs and 40 grams of sugar.,, If your grinder cannot take 5 minute at a time, grind for about one minute and let the grinder cool down before starting it up again. At a certain point, the cocoa butter will be released, creating a thick, tar-like appearance. At this point, you need to scrape off the mass that is stuck to the side and bottom of the grinder. The grinding is done when the mass flows easily., This step is optional., Add in your chocolate after the mortar and pestle is heated and grind away!, When it tastes done, you know it's done! The next step is optional but is very recommended., Take about 2/3 of the total batch and pour it on to the marble slab. Fold and agitate the melted chocolate with the scraping tools, ensuring that no lumps are forming., When it does, pour it back into the rest of the batch and mix. At this point, you can now pour it into molds. Enjoy!
