You can use the rate of interest your cash outlay could be earning if invested, the inflation rate or the stated rate an investment must meet in order to be approved by your company.



If you will be using more than 3 years of returns, make cell labels for those years as well.



The initial investment represents the cash you will need to contribute in order to begin the project or investment and should be entered as a negative value.
The 1st, 2nd and 3rd year return values will be estimates of what you expect to realize during the first few years of the project. A net gain should be entered as a positive value, but, if you anticipate a net loss in one or more years, those should be entered as negatives.



If the initial cash outlay occurs at the end of the first period, it will be included as a value in thâ€‹e NPV function.
If it occurs now, or at the beginning of the first period, it will not be included in the NPV function. Instead, you will add it to the result of the NPV function.



Select the cell and click the function button, labeled "fx." Choose the NPV function. The function window will launch.
Enter a reference to cell B1 in the "rate" field.
Enter a reference to cell B2 in the first "value" field only if the investment occurs at the end of the first period. Otherwise, do not enter a reference to cell B2.
Enter references to cells B3, B4 and B5 in the next 3 value fields. Click the "OK" button.



Otherwise, the NPV is as calculated by the formula.
