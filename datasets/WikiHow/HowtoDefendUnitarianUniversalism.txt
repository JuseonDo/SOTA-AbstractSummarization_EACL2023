 How would you explain UUism (Unitarian Universalism) to someone in an elevator? It should be short and sweet. For example, "We don't tell you what God is, we show you how to find yours.";
, Chances are, they'll have at least one misconception about UUism, such as thinking that we believe that absolutely anything goes. It's usually pretty easy to correct things they think about UUism that are just plain wrong.
 Explain how they form a framework for each person's establishment of their own beliefs. Point out how someone truly evil would not be able to work within them.
 Include some notable UUs, to show them that we've been around a long time.
 Most of us turned our minds and spirits inside out when working through that class, and at some point wished there was one book to explain it all.

, Talk about the benefits of being in a community of like-minded people.
