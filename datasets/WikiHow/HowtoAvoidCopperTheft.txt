 Many people have motion sensors by their door, but the vent to get in will be in a dark place behind your home. A sneaky dark alley is the perfect place for a criminal to sneak in.;
, A thief will be less likely to grab something with an identifying mark. You could even write a phone number or street address to make it seem important. They would not take that, for the fear of being caught.
 These can help to deter robbers, as they will not be able to get in. Make sure to put your keys in a safe place.
 A fence can prevent robbers from getting to your house. Make sure that you can still get out of your house though., If a line is cut, a pressure gauge can tell you that it has, and go off. This can be a great way to defend the copper.
 This can be a great way to educate others about the dangers of robbery. Take notice of vacant properties in your neighborhood, which could be used as a meeting point for the group.
 The police can help track down the person who stole your copper, saving you thousands of dollars on buying a new one.
