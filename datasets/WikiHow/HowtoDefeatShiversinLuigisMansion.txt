 If you don't have this already, go to the Fortune Teller's Room, then go through the door on the right. Vacuum up the ghosts, open the treasure chest, and collect the medal. To get the key to the Butler's room, go back to the Fortune Teller's room and light all the candles using your Fire Element. A key should then appear. Suck it into your vacuum cleaner to gain access to Shivers' room.;
, Shivers should then reveal himself, as he is scared of fire and will now retreat to his room.
 When he sits down on a chair and starts to rock back and forth while yelling, this is your chance to suck him in.
