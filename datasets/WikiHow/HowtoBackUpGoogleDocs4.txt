 There are a number of providers out there, and they all vary based on what services they offer, what level of security they use, whether they have free trials or free accounts, and how much their paid service costs.
 This will often be their service with limited functionality, or will be a fully functional service that expires after short time period.
 When you do pick one, sign up for their full account.


Most services do have a small fee for their full functionality, commonly in the ballpark of a few dollars a month.
 Once signed up, backing up your Google Docs is often done automatically, and is stored in the cloud where you can access your information, restore old data, or make changes from any location and device.
