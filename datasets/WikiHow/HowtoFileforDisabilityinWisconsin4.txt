 In most cases, you will receive information regarding whether or not you were approved to receive benefits within 100 days of filing the disability paperwork; however, this may take longer depending on the medical information you provided.
 If the Wisconsin DDB approved your disability claim, you will begin to receive disability payments; however, if your claim was denied, you will have the option to file an appeal within 60 days of receiving the notice.
