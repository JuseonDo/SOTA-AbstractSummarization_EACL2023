 You will know what extra items you and the kids need to complete the day, like lunch boxes, sports gear, or money for field trips. Plus, you will be able to coordinate drop-off and pick-up schedules with your partner.;
, Not only will this give you time to mend a hole in your favorite pants or iron a shirt, but it will give you time to decide if it's the right outfit for the day's events. The kids can even pick out their clothes before bed, giving them a sense of accomplishment when they get ready faster in the morning, and giving you time to approve of their dress.
 If an item needs to be kept cold, you can still get it ready; just stick it in the fridge overnight and pop it into the appropriate bag in the morning. Get duplicates of items (like bottles or formula for diaper bags) so you have enough for the house and the bag.
 If your coffee machine has a timer, use it; otherwise, all you will have to do is press the "on" button. You can make a pitcher of iced coffee ahead of time. Keep a to-go cup near the coffee pot so you can fill it and go.
 Then you know that everybody has ample time to shower, shave, or do their hair and make-up without having to listen to early morning arguing.
 Fruit, cereal bars, yogurt, and trail mix all make great, portable breakfasts when you are in a rush.
 When the timer goes off you have to be done. After a few weeks of the timer, you probably won't need it anymore because you will have trained in better timing.
 Near the coffee pot and your mug, on top of a briefcase, or next to the purse are great locations. Then, when you are on the way out the door in the morning you will see it, instead of spending that extra five minutes running around trying to remember where you had the phone last.
