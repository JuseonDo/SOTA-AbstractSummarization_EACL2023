, Tuck pointing is the process of replacing lost mortar between bricks.
 This may take up to 24 hours, but they must be dry before applying the primer to prevent later damage from water seepage.
 Use a paint stick equipped with a heavy lamb's wool roller made for brick applications. Work in sections from top to bottom, checking frequently for drips. Fill in small areas where the roller cannot reach with a paint brush. Allow the primer to dry thoroughly.
 You will have a choice of finishes: flat, satin or high-gloss. Use the same roller and brush technique as you used to apply the primer. You may need 2 coats for full coverage.
