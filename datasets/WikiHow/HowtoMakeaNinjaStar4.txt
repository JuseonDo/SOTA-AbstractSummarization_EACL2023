 With a specific series of folds, you can turn a square or rectangular sheet of paper into a four-pointed ninja throwing star.



Create a ninja star from square origami paper or make a ninja star from rectangular construction paper. Many of the folds and basic techniques are similar, but there are a few variations.
For something different, fold an eight-pointed ninja star instead. This origami ninja star can be made with sticky notes.
 You can unfold two paper clips and tape them together to quickly create a simplified, four-pointed ninja star.
 If you have a pack of spare binder rings or a three-ring binder that you plan to scrap, save two of the rings and use them to create a metal ninja star.
 Duct tape can be used to create almost anything nowadays, and ninja stars are no exception. Start with a cardboard base and cover the base with metallic duct tape.
 Tape four nails together securely in order to form a quick yet durable four-pointed ninja star.
 Trace the shape onto an old CD and carefully cut it out. Note that these ninja stars are better for decorative use than throwing use.
 Carefully cut the ninja star shape out of the metal lid and file down the edges for an easy yet fairly realistic version.
 For an even more realistic appearance, trace the shape of the ninja star onto a thin piece of sheet metal or steel and cut it out.
 If working with metal has you feeling unnerved, cut a ninja star out from a piece of wood, instead. Note that the sides of this star will need to be sanded down, as well.
