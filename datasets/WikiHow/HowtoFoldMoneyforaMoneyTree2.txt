, The top edge of the fold should be at the mid-point lengthwise. The fold should create a 45 degree angle, and the rest of the right length should go downward at an angle. Fold the left side in, in a similar fashion. There should be a triangle and the two flaps going toward the center at an angle.
, Fit the flap inside the triangle, through the opening.
 Tuck the extra into the opening on the side. You should have your first, smallest triangle neatly folded.
 Fold it down 2/3 of the way lengthwise. This will help you to make a slightly larger triangle. Repeat the same instructions to fold the triangle as the previous bill.
 Fold it 1/4 the way down lengthwise. This will form your largest triangle. Repeat the same triangle folding instructions as with the previous bill.
 Continue folding it until you have a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) roll of the entire width of the bill. Unroll it and refold into a box using the creases that were just made.
 Insert the large triangle into the bottom edge of the medium-sized triangle. Insert the top into the smallest triangle to create your pine tree.
