 You will have to make the wig more messy and crazy after it comes. Suggested places to buy your black wig is eBay. Otherwise, you could probably find one in the stores.


Alternatively, if your hairstyle is similar to L's, you could also just dye your hair black. Use temporary dye if you don't want to walk around with black hair for longer than a couple of days.;
,, Buy one at Walmart, Target, etc. They shouldn't be expensive at all.
,, If you are, wear some regular tennis shoes or flip-flops that don't really stand out.
