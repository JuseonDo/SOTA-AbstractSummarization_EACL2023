 Bright reds are more likely to fade much faster. If you're looking for a longer lasting red choose a more natural color.
 Despite it sounding gross, it's actually better to wash your hair every other day rather than every day. Your heads natural oils help condition your hair, keeping it healthier, while also keeping your red color in longer. When looking to skip a day of washing, wear a shower cap to keep your hair from getting wet while showering.
 Use shampoos specifically for colored hair, or even better, for red colored hair. These shampoos are less likely to strip your hair of it's color. You can also opt for a sulfate free shampoo, which is much better for your hair, as it won't strip away it's natural oils.
 Your colored hair is much more susceptible to damage. Damaged hair doesn't look that great and you may not be able to redye it as often.
 The sun does fade red hair, so try to avoid those UV rays!

 Wet all your hair.
 Consider using just conditioner if you can, as shampoo strips your hair of your color more than conditioner will.
