 There's a good chance you'll get launched over your bars a couple times, so strap on your helmet, gloves, and pads. If you are rocking clipless pedals, switch to flats to make ejects easier. Find a big grassy area with no obstacles to practice in.;
,, Keep increasing the braking power until your rear wheel begins to lift. If you find that the rear wheel is pitching upward too quickly, release the brake immediately and move your weight rearward.
 Gently shift your weight back over the rear wheel to balance and keep yourself from going over the bars.
, Increase your speed and amplitude to up the altitude. The faster you go, and the quicker you shift your weight forward, the higher the rear wheel will lift.
