 The oil needs to be hot before you can add the onion and garlic.;
, This will take about 2 to 3 minutes. Still, the onion and garlic often with a wooden spoon or spatula so that they don't burn.
 Use a wooden spoon or spatula to help break the beef up into smaller pieces. and flip the beef occasionally so that both sides cook. Pour the excess fat away; you can save this fat for another recipe, or you can throw it into the trash.
 Do not drain the beans before adding them; simply toss everything into the skillet. The liquid from the beans will help keep the chili moist and prevent it from becoming too dry.
 This can take as little as 30 to 40 minutes to as long as 2 hours., You can always serve the chili as it, but it will be much tastier with some cilantro, shredded cheese, or sour cream.
