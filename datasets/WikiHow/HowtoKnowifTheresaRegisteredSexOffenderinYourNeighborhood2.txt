 You can find it at www.familywatchdog.us/. This is a free service that allows you to see a map of your neighborhood with markings indicating where sex offenders live.
 It's in the lefthand column. Enter your street address and your city, state and zip code.
 You'll see a map with tiny squares indicating places where sex offenders live. Click on a square to see more information about each offender.
