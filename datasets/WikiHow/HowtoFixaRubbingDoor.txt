 Give them a little twist with a ratcheting screwdriver.;
, Check to see if this relieves the rubbing. If it does, tighten the hinge screws with a ratcheting screwdriver. You may use a drill with a screwdriver head attachment, but you need to be careful not to overdrive the screws and break or strip them.
 Look for paint that has been worn away by the door. Use a stepladder to look at the top of the door.
,, You may need someone to help you catch the door.
 This will help reduce the chance of the face of the door chipping.
 Sandpaper can be used for small rubbing problems, while the belt sander or circular saw are ideal for more extreme door-sticking issues. Be careful not to cut the door too deep or too far. Interior doors are often hollow with only 1 inch (2.54 cm) of wood to stabilize the door. Do not remove more than 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch (.64 to 1.27 cm) of wood. If your door is a solid wood door, you have more leeway in regards to how much wood you can remove.
 You may have to remove the door several times to keep it from rubbing; however, this is better than taking too much off.
