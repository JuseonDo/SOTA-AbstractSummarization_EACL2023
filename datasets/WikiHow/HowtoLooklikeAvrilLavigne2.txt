 If your hair isn't already blonde, consider dying your hair blonde. Then streak your hair black.
 Wear black, white, dark red, and navy blue clothes. Any dark, solid colored tank tops work well, and you can wear two tanks at the same time with both of them showing. For a unique Avril look, put crazy pins on your shirt and pants. Wear boys shirts, cargo pants or baggy jeans. Wear hoodies and put your hood up.
 Get brands like DC's, Vans, and black high-top Converse.
,, Do not forget the solid-coloured sweatbands and spike bracelets. Add rings and chains to add to the Avril look. Wear rings on your thumb.
