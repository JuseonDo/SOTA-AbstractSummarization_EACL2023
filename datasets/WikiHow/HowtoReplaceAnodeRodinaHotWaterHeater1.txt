 Depending on the fuel used for the heater you must first shut off the gas supply to the unit. If it is electric you must shut off the power. This is critical. If you do not shut off the electricity, you will burn out the heating elements in a few seconds. If the heater is oil fired, shut off the motor switch.;
, You won't want water shooting out all over the place.
 If you do not have the space (at least three (3) feet) you will have to drain the tank. Loosen the anode rod before the next step, it will make life easier.
 Tilt it enough to allow you to remove the old anode rod. Before going to this trouble, verify that your anode rod is not articulated. If it is, you may skip emptying the tank and disconnecting the water connections In the event you do have to drain the tank, disconnect the water and tilt the tank to remove the old rod, consider replacing it with an articulated anode rod. This will make future maintenance much easier.
 Verify that you have no leaks.
