,,, Never underestimate the power of word of mouth, talk to everyone you know and meet, face to face interaction is the best way to get people involved.
 But it is becoming increasingly popular to sell your tickets online. By using PayPal you can sell your tickets online so that people can pay with a credit or debit card. If you don’t have the ability to do this, then please contact www.protestispatriotism.org they will help you set up a PayPal account, and give you space on their website to sell your ticket.
 Most groups don’t issue tickets as they just keep a list of names and check them off as people get on the bus.
 Bus captains are responsible for making sure the trip is organized, all the riders are on the bus and for informing the riders about the plans and events.
 They are a packet that contains a list of events, a basic map, metro info and arrival / departure times and places. They also offend include some fun items such as stickers, small signs along with general info about weather, what to expect and legal info. If you do not want or have time to create your own you can go to www.protestispatriotism.org they will e-mail you the packet that they create and or work with you to create one.
 These trips can be long and sometimes boring. Most charter companies have TVs with DVD players so bring a variety of movies. It is also a great opportunity to start conversation, debate and do some training.
