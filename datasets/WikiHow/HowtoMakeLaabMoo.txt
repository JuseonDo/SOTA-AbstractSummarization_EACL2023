 Mix well and let it marinate on the side for a few minutes.;
, Add the marinated pork and stir. The pork will stick to the pan at first, but then the juice will come out and the meat will loosen from the bottom. Keep stirring until the pork is well done.
 Add the fish sauce, green onion, shallot, cilantro, the rest of the lime juice, chilli, and almost all of the toasted rice to the bowl. Save some toasted rice on the side for the garnish.
 It should be a little hot, as you should be able to taste the tartness from the lime juice and fish sauce. Season the mixture with extra lime juice or fish sauce if needed.
