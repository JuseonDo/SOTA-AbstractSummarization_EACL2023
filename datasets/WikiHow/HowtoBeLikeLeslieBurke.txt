 Also, have a special glow (be upbeat) and be happy. When you enter a room, try to brighten it up!;
, Don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild!

, Don't be afraid to clash colors and make interesting color combinations!

, Don't dye it because Leslie was all about being yourself, and dying your hair would imply that you don't like your original hair color.
 To make arm warmers, cut up socks (in the commentaries of the movie they said that the arm warmers were made of cut-up socks!). Those sweet shoes she wears are white Converse (Chuck Taylors). If you can't find white converse, then you can always bleach a pair. Customize them with different laces, baubles, etc.
 She wore clothes that weren't too girly, and easy to move in.
 Don't be hypocritical and pretend to always be picturing things when you're not, but think in your mind occasionally. "this was really something else." This is what Leslie would do. Another thing is to pretend that you're a fictional character. And if you're so inclined, find a space and make up a secret world!

,, Try to be innocent and don't act all snobby just because you got something that nobody else has.
 In the books, Leslie was described as lonely (until she met Jess). This doesn't mean to break away from your friends, but when you're along, enjoy your solitude and make something good out of it.
