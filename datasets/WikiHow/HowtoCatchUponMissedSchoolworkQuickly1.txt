, Ask them to give any key points given by the teacher and share any notes they took in the class while you were absent. Make sure to know the due dates on all your missing work and the way your teacher wants your project, homework or assignment (i.e. the amount of content, paper/plastic cover, with images or some creativity).
 There's a very good chance that the students in the class you asked got something wrong. Teachers also give great tips on how to streamline the process of getting back on track. This works especially well if the teacher likes you, they may give you more time for the assignment.
 Do you like smooth gentle music? Or maybe does metal keep you up? Or will you study faster with silence? Whatever it is, use it.
 This helps avoid distractions. But also make sure your room is light enough so you do not get too sleepy!

, Get all the clutter off and keep only what you need. A clock, paper, pen/pencil and your work should suffice.
, Make a clear plan, and only do the core activities that are necessary.
 No.1 Long term projects. No.2 Homework No.3 Revision.
 Set in in steps like 1. brainstorm, 2. writing, 3. editing. Don't forget to read through the whole project again after some time.
 Divide it into categories like Chemistry- 45 minutes and 10 min break etc.
 Also turn off your phone if it is a distraction.
 Read them, use their advice as best you can, then get off the internet and get your work done.
 It may seem overwhelming, but you can do one assignment at a time.
