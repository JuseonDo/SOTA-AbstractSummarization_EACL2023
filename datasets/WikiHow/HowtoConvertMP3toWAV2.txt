 Depending on your version of iTunes, you may have to convert the file(s) a bit differently, but it's not drastic.



If using iTunes 7 or earlier, you'll need to go to the "Advanced" tab before being able to access "Import Settings."
If using iTunes 8 or later, going to "Preferences" will automatically direct you to the page where you can find "Advanced."

,

, Next to "Setting," choose either "Automatic" or "Custom...".


If you want a custom setting, click on "Custom..." and select choices for Sample Rate, Sample Size, and Channels. Under most circumstances, you want your channel set to "Stereo."

,,,, Depending on your version of iTunes, do this either by:


With the file(s) selected, navigate to the "Advanced" tab and choose "Create WAV Version."
Simply right-click the file and click "Create WAV Version."
