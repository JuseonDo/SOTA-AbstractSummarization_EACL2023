 (The gel crystals are available at craft stores). Heat on "high" for three minutes to dry the crystals as much as possible.
 The glass must be wide enough to accommodate the flower you're drying.
 Cut enough so that only an inch (2.5cm) remains attached to the flower. Stick the stem into the crystals so that the blossom stands upright.
 Keep pouring until the flower is completely covered.
 Cook for 1 minute 45 seconds for rosebuds or up to 4 or 5 minutes for larger blossoms.
 Gently pour off the crystals once cooled. Clean the flower petals carefully with a fine paintbrush, then mist lightly with an acrylic spray. The flowers can now be used for display or artwork.
