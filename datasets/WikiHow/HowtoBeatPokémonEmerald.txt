 Don't train just one Pokémon and leave the rest weak, which gives you a disadvantage, especially if you come against a type disadvantage.


Every gym is different, plan ahead and train specific Pokémon to battle. Have one back-up of similar type, just in case your main Pokémon faints.;
, Make sure to take advantage of those different personalities.
 They come between levels 50-80 and can be much stronger than other Pokémon, if trained right. However, this is a cheap way to win, and they won't always be the best just because they're Legendary Pokémon. For example, many Pokémon like Metagross and Salamence are more commonly used in the competitive battling metagame.


Even if you get the legendary Pokémon, still train the regular Pokémon up. You want power to battle, plus, it's fun just to train. Keep in mind what was said above -- Legends can often ruin the fun of the game.
 They usually use Zubat/Golbat and Poochyena/Mightyena. Raising Pokémon that are strong against Poison and Dark types can give you an advantage into beating Team Magma and Aqua. This, however, is unnecessary if your team is already full, because utilizing a couple of Psychic/Fighting-Type moves is more efficient than just taking a random Pokémon with a type advantage.
, Usually, it's best to go with it and have the adventure of the game.
