 Middle schoolers often see themselves as independent and because of that don't ask for help. If you see your child struggling, go and help.;
, Especially as your child goes into the more advanced math or a class you never took, make sure you know the topic well enough that you can explain it.
 Instead, walk him or her through the problem or offer suggestions to find information.


When you walk you child through a problem, ask questions such as "what comes next?" or "what does that equal?". Never give away an answer, no matter how much your child begs.
If your child doesn't know an answer, give suggestions to look it up, like a textbook or trusted websites.
 Even if the teacher doesn't collect the homework and check it, it is still a good idea since homework is for practice and you want to make sure the kid is doing it right.
 Make sure he or she is doing it right. If not, repeat the same procedure you used yesterday.
