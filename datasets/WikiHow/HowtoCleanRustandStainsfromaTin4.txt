 Find a medium-sized potato and slice it in half. Coat the cut end with dish soap or environmentally friendly cleaning powder. The soap causes a chemical reaction that helps to remove the rust stain.
 Work the stain vigorously with the cut potato edge until the rust has been removed. Remember you need to apply a significant amount of force in order to effectively scrub away the rust.


If you need to reapply the potato, simply cut off the soapy edge and apply the dish soap to the new edge of the cut potato.
A mixture of baking soda and water can be substituted for the dish soap if necessary.
If the rust stain is small, you can simply leave the potato over the spot for a few hours.
 Use steel wool or a coarse cloth to make you have enough friction to remove the remaining stain. Give the tinware ample time to dry.
