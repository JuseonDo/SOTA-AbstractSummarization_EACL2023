obtain necessary parts (pads, rotors--whichever is being replaced) from auto parts store.jack up front or rear, chock wheels, and place jack stands for safety.remove wheel.

@summary
look at the caliper (part that sits on edge of rotor, presses the brake pads against rotor).

@summary
on the back side of the caliper there are two torx bolts under black plastic caps about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) round.

@summary
the brake pads may need to be pushed out from the rotor slightly to make removing the caliper easier (especially if there is a noticeable lip formed on the outermost circumference of your rotor).

@summary
the caliper can now slide off of the rotor.

@summary
use a g clamp or brake piston pushing tool to force the piston as far back as it will go, using the old pad to push against.

@summary
take the old pads out and replace with the new ones.replace the calipers and tighten the torx bolts back down.

this is a good time to check and possibly rotate the tires.reset service interval reminder (see how to reset service interval reminder for 2006 bmw 525xi).

 Don't forget to place new sensor. Takes just one sensor for front, one for the rear.
,, There is an anti-rattle clip on the front which will pop out with pressure applied by a screwdriver between the wheel hub and inside edge of the clip., Pop the caps out and you will be able to back out the bolts with a T-45 bit., Do this by inserting a sturdy flathead screwdriver or a small pry bar in between the pads and rotor and levering them away in either direction. This moves the calipers piston, which is the component which physically pushes the pad into the rotor, slightly into the caliper., Hang the caliper with a wire from the springs, so it's not hanging by the brake line to prevent a brake fluid leak. Let's just say you don't want that., If you don't do this you won't be able to reinstall the caliper with the new pads in., The brake pad wear sensor attaches to the inner pad on the passenger side (pay attention to how it is installed and clip the new one back in the same way). Attach the other end of the sensor to the harness which is in a protective box on the upper part of the wheel well.,, Check tyre wear but avoid rotating them if they have a larger track width at the back. Sizes are printed on the tyre sidewall eg- 255/45 R18. the first number (255) is the tread width. if your tyres are wearing unevenly, i.e wearing one side more than another, then get a wheel alignment from a quality wheel repair shop.,
