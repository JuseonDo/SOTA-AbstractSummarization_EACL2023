start by dragging the window all around the screen.

@summary
another thing you can do with the window is dragging it to the side of your screen so all you see is a black screen (well, except a thin blue line which is your window).

@summary
skip nearly every single math problem.

success!

 To do that, hold and shake the mouse rapidly and watch your window fly!

, To drag the window off the screen, simply click and drag it to the left or right of the screen until you can't see it anymore (you should see a thin blue line when you're done).
 Press and hold the number 6 key on your keyboard (even though any other key could work), and watch as you save up time in speeding through the problems even though it is considered cheating. But do you hate school? Go ahead dude! Note: If you can't skip a problem, type the incorrect answer to the problem several times before entering it, and soon, you'll go back to a problem that you can skip through.
 Successmaker has been screwed thanks to you! Now you will see your terrible grades unlike your peer's grades, which are great!
