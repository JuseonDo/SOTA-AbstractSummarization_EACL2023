 With a male dog, the aim is harder, so emptying his bladder into the toilet would be more difficult. You can stand or squat with the dog.
 Your left hand should be supporting the dog around his rib cage.
 You should feel above the base of his genitals for the bladder. Sometimes it is quite high up in the body.
 The urine must make a right angle turn through the urethra, so don't worry about squeezing toward any direction. Again, continue squeezing until the bladder is flat.
