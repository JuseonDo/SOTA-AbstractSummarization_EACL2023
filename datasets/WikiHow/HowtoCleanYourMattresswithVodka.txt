 Before you go in for the big deodorant, make sure you have removed any other offending items/odor.


Use a clean, damp cloth to pick up residue and spot clean/treat troublesome areas.
Rub area with cloth to ensure all debris is removed.;
, Fill 2/3 of the way with the vodka. Also, don’t worry about the vodka quality--cheap vodka works as well as the expensive stuff!

, You can combine aromas, but make sure you like the way the essential oil smells.
