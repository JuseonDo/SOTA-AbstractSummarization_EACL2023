 The floral center should be facing you, and away from your date's chest. The greenery, such as the leaves, should be facing away from you, toward your date's chest.;
, Think of it as going above your date's heart. It should be roughly equidistant between the left and right edges of the lapel., Position the stem at a slight angle so it is running parallel to the edge of the lapel., Inserting the pin from the back will keep the pin hidden so the metal won't catch the light when you take pictures., Position the pin so that it is facing down. The point of the pin should go through the stem where it is thick, just below where it attaches to the petals., The overall movement is a simple push out all the way through the fabric and the flower stem, then weaving back in through the flower stem and fabric.


You can also think of the pin as going forward through the fabric and stem, then back through the fabric again. The head of the pin and the point of the pin will both end up on the back of the lapel, hidden from view.
 Take a step back and examine the placement, making sure it is not askew or starting to pivot on the pin., If the boutonniere is heavy, you may want to secure it with an second pin. Simply stitch the pin through the lapel and boutonniere as you did before, with this second pin about half an inch below the first.
