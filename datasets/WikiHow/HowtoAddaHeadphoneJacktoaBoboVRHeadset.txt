,, Pull up back housing. Fold over carefully as headphones and button jack are still attached.
,, This step is a bit tricky once the dial is removed, there is a white plastic cover that needs to be removed. Use the flat head screw driver to push tabs in; starting from inside to out and then remove cover. Do no use force to pry because they can be damaged and cover won't go back into place.
 Pull off head phones and pull wire through. Then replace these screws back over straps.
 Repeat for other side. There will be a tiny bit of light bleeding through where the headphones were, so you might want to add something small where headphones were to block out light., The front case lip is 1/2" so make sure jack won't touch the case when it is fully retracted. Cut the wire and strip the ends.
, You can use a stereo test app to test L and R individually., Be sure to measure carefully and set the angle of the jack so it sits snugly.
 Lay black front case face down and turn the dials in all the way then mostly out to make sure that both sides are moving evenly. Make sure you screw in the case screws when its almost fully expanded or you will lose distance.
