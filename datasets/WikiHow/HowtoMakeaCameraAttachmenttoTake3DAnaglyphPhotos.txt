@summary
before you start, take a look at the photos on the following website to get an idea of the steps.

@summary
gather the supplies listed below.

@summary
,print the template from www.gibbondesign.com/anaglyph.pdf onto a sheet of a4 size paper (you can also print it on 8.5‿ x 11‿ paper and scale it to the correct size using the dimensions on the paper)

@summary
,

@summary
use this template to cut the walls out the mat board.

@summary
tape the filter material to the rectangular windows.

@summary
tape the template (double sided tape works well) for the inner and outer boards on the fiberboard and use a jigsaw to cut these pieces.

@summary
if you want a sturdier device, you can place 76mm standoffs between the fiberboard pieces.

@summary
now it’s time for the assembly.

@summary
position the wall panels around the assembly.

@summary

,,, I traced the pattern on the mat board first and used a ruler and utility knife to cut the pieces.
 The red filter is for the large window.
 You can use a sander to get rid of the jagged edges. Use glue or double sided tape to stick the inner and outer boards together. Place the mirror and beamsplitter in the groves on the inner board while the glue is setting.
 The cross hairs on the template should be used to mark the holes for the standoffs (I used a M4 drill with M4 screws).
 Position the mirror and beamsplitter between the top and bottom fiberboard panels so that they are sitting in the slots. If you used a first surface mirror (recommended), make sure the reflective side is facing the beamsplitter (you can test this by placing your finger against the glass; the side that doesn’t give you a double image is the reflective side).
 Tape the top and bottom of the wall panels to the fiberboard panels. Congratulations! You’re done.
 I find it best to turn off the flash and zoom in as close as possible. Then put the camera lens through the hole and shoot.
