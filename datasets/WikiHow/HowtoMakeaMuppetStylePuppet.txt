for the upper body, using a t-shirt and a button up shirt over it gives the body some strength.

@summary
lay your hand on a piece of fleece (make sure to put fingers together or apart depending upon how many fingers you want the puppet to have.
@article
 This is the head of the puppet.;
, You'll also need to cut the jaw to separate it from the head so you can control it with your hand later.


You can also cut away the nose and create a different, more pronounced one later.
Cut eye sockets as well.
If you'd like your puppet's jaw to move more freely, entirely cut away a jaw section. Make a "flap" jaw from cardboard.
 You can use hot glue or spray adhesive. The latter provides a stronger bond, but is harder to work with. Cut a piece of fleece that is big enough to cover your puppet head and start gluing it to the middle of the face. Make sure you glue the fleece deep into the eye sockets. Moving out from the center, keep readjusting, stretching and gluing until you have cover the face evenly and securely. Be sure to leave some extra for the neck.


If you cut off the nose earlier, apply the nose after you put the skin on. Cover the nose with fleece after you apply it.
Use the fleece to hold the jaw onto the face.
, Glue some black fleece inside the mouth, as well as a small piece of red fleece to act as a tongue.


You can use a hat instead of hair if you'd like.
 Glue the neck to the inside of the t-shirt and glue the collar around the neck of the puppet. If you'd like to give the puppet better body weight, crumple some newspaper and put it inside the shirt or use some extra foam to create a body.


You can also add ears, eyebrows, mustache or anything else you want your puppet to have. Maybe an eye patch!?

, Using a pen, trace around your fingers to create the pattern for the hand. Double over two pieces of fleece and cut them out. Now stitch them together. Do the same for the other hand, and now your finished puppet has hands!
