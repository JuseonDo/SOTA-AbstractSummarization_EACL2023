 Glue one end of the ribbon in place, then begin to wrap. As you wrap, carefully overlay the next wrap over the far edge of the last wrap, to maintain the neatness and to ensure that the hoop material does not show through between the joins. Finish by gluing the other end in place. Wait until dried before proceeding.;
, Wrap around or glue on a strand of fabric flowers, beads, additional ribbon, and other elements as wished.
 Cut the felt so that it has five "teeth". Also cut a trapezoid shape from additional felt in the same color––see the image for guidance.
, The widest part of the trapezoid should be facing away from the points of the felt.
,,, Glue one flat pearl on each tooth top, one by one.
 Place the strip in the center of the circular felt and glue only one of the short ends.
 Glue the other end of the strip. Done; you now have a crown headband for baby's birthday.
