 Your iOS device MUST be jailbroken in order to install mods for Minecraft PE. There is no other way to install mods on Apple devices.



Click here for instructions on jailbreaking your device. The instructions work for iPods, iPhones, and iPads.;
, This app is only available for jailbroken iOS devices, and can be downloaded from the Cydia store.
 Once you have iFile installed, you're ready to install ModLoader. Visit sharedroutine.com/mcpe/modloader/ on your device and scroll down to the "Downloads" section.
 This will open the download page for ModLoader.
 This will launch the iFile app.
 This will install ModLoader. If you don't see the option, tap the com.sharedroutine.mcloader.deb file and then tap "Installer".
 There is a small selection of mods that are available from the SharedRoutine website that you can use. Download and install these the same way you did ModLoader.
 There are tons of different mods that are available on Cydia, and most of them work with ModLoader. As long as the file is a .deb file, you can download it and install it using iFile.


The mod must be designed to run with ModLoader. Most of the popular mods are built for this.
 You can drag this button around so that it is placed somewhere more convenient.
 The settings for each of your installed mods will be displayed in the Mod Menu. Depending on the mod, you can use the sliders to adjust the effects, or toggle the mods ON or OFF.
