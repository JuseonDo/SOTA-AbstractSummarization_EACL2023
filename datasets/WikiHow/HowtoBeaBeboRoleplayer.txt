, This can be either canon (an actual character from the series - such as Ron Weasley, Edward Cullen, etc.) or non-canon (a character you make up yourself - such as "Barty Crouch Jr's sister" or "Miley Stewart's cousin", etc). A canon character might be the easiest when you're just starting up.
 Set up an email address for your character, and then log onto www.bebo.com .
, Put in some of your character's history - look them up on Wikipedia for some extra help - and make sure you add somewhere on your profile (e.g. in the side bar) that you are a ROLEPLAYER, not a fake or someone who actually thinks they are their character.
, Type some names of characters from the series into the Bebo search bar, and add the characters who come up. You can also try searching for people on Bebo RP groups, such as www.bebo.com/RoleplayForSale or www.bebo.com/RoleplayROCKS

, Look up other roleplayers' profile comments for an idea of what to aim for.
 Find someone who's online, and leave them a comment. Set it out like this: (in this example, you are RPing as Harry Potter, and trying to RP with a Ron Weasley).
 "Ron!" he called out. "Where have you been?"

, And congratulations on your first ever RP account!
