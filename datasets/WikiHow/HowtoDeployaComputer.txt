 This step is only necessary if you want to keep the files on your old computer. If you have files saved on a LAN (Local Area Network) then you needn't worry about those as they can be moved when the computer is hooked up to the network. It doesn't matter what you back them up on, you could use anything from an external hard drive to 158 USB thumb drives, but a hard drive is best. Once you are all backed up you may move on.;
, If they are all tangled up, untangle them. You won't want to have to deal with an endless tangle of wires.
, Besides, there's nothing huge on it anymore. Cleaning your desk has never been easier!

, Some newer monitors have USB ports in them so don't forget to hook up the uplink (this will allow you to plug in USB devices with ease. Some new monitors double as a USB hub). If your new computer came with a new mouse and/or keyboard then hook those up with it.
