@summary
cut a single large strawberry into 8 smaller pieces.

@summary
cut 4 grapes into halves.

@summary
take two twizzlers and form an x shape.

@summary
stick a toothpick into the middle of the x.take a grape and stick it through the toothpick in a horizontal fashion.

@summary
take a piece of strawberry and stick it through the same toothpick.repeat the same procedure for three other toothpicks.

@summary
attach each end of a toothpick with fruit on it to the top portion of the twizzlers.

@summary
attach each end of another toothpick with fruit on it to the bottom portion of the twizzlers.

@summary
attach a third toothpick with fruit already on it, slightly under the top one.

@summary
attach the final toothpick with the fruit already on it.

 Cut in any which way you chose as long as they are big enough to stick through toothpick.


Key note: By cutting the strawberry into eighths and four grapes in half, you will have double the amount of food needed. This is to your benefit, in case any problems occur in building the model.
 Try to get them as even as possible, ensuring that the top and bottom are proportional., In doing so, penetrate both Twizzlers, so as to have them stick together.
, Make sure there is room on both ends of toothpick.,, Make sure to attach the toothpick from the inside of one Twizzler to the inside of the other Twizzler and not from out to in.( Look at picture for clarity.)

, Once again, make sure that the toothpick is being attached from the inside of one Twizzler to the inside of the other., Attach this toothpick the exact same way you did the other two. The molecule will now begin to twist., Place it slightly above the bottom one.

If either top or bottom of any part of the molecule detaches while trying to do the final two steps, simply continue attaching them and then reattach whatever came off afterwards.
