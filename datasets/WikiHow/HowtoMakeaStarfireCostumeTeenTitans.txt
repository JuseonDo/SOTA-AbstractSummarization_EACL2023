Measure your waist and cut out a long strip that will work as the belt. Sew the strip together and hem the edges.
Using craft foam, cut out a circle by tracing the edge of a small cup around the craft foam and cutting it out. Glue the material over the circle and attach it to one of the ends of the belt.
Add velcro to the back of the circle and the other end of the belt

, Cut a slit down the back. This will work as your 'armor."
Cover the armor with the same silvery material and glue it down. Add velcro to the back.
Add a large green gem in the center, right where your sternum is. You can either buy the gem at a craft store or make it yourself with a resin cast.



Measure out your arm's length and cut out a square of the silver material.
Sew it to fit to the contour of your arm.
Hem the edges and make sure that your fingers are not covered, since her gloves are fingerless.
