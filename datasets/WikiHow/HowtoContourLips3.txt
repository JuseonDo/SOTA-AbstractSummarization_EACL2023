, Use a liner 1-3 shades darker than the liner you previously used. This makes the center of your lips more prominent.
 Using the darker lip liner, shade the grooves of your lips so that they look deeper. Feel free to thicken these lines a little for a plumper look. If you have to, purse your lips like you're going to kiss someone on the cheek, this will define the shallow parts from the plump parts.
 Use a lipstick that matches the lighter liner you originally used. The shadows from the darker liner should still be visible.
