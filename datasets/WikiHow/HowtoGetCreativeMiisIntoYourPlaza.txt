 There is no possible way to do this without Internet. It allows you to use the channels it comes with, such as "Forecast Channel" or "News Channel".;
,,, When it is, go back to the Wii Menu and click on it.
 Some Miis should appear. You can take all those. It splits into categories, such as Top 50, Popular, Grab Bag, or Favorites.
 When you find one you like, click on it, and select Import Mii, click A, and give it a nickname.
 If not, turn your Wii off and back on. It will say, "A Mii sent by Nintendo has arrived."

, You can play as them in Wii Sports, Wii Play, and other games made by Nintendo for the Wii.
 But, you can also buy a Ethernet cable with a USB converter so it can go in the USB port in the back of you Wii Console.)
