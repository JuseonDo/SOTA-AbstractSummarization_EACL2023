 Sketch a circle connected to a smaller one. Sketch in a guide for the facial features.
 Put another smaller set inside for each ear.

 Make a small one for the neck and two large ones for the body.
 This will serve as a guide for the mane. A male lion's defining feature is its mane, as it makes it look bigger, so really emphasize that aspect!
