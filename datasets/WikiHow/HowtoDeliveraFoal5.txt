@summary
in normal unassisted births, a foal born live will break the sac on his own when he shakes his head.

@summary
get the foal breathing as quick as you can, clearing mucus away from his nose with a suction bulb.

@summary
once new momma and baby are delivered and the foal is breathing normally, leave them alone.

@summary
disinfect the navel stump with iodine.

@summary
the afterbirth should soon follow 15 to 45 minutes later after birth, sometimes taking around 2 hours to be completely shed.

@summary
bag up the afterbirth immediately, then spread it out on a table to let it dry and have a look at it to see if it's intact and a health coloration or not.

@summary
if all is well and both the mare and her foal are healthy and happy, enjoy watching the foal grow into a healthy new horse!

 If the membrane has not broken around his head, break it and make sure he's breathing.
 You may have to hold him upside down for a few seconds to get the fluid out. Tickle his nostril with a clean piece of straw if that doesn't work. Or, slap his ribcage if even that won't work. You can even try positioning him so that he's sitting on his chest and his head and chin is resting on the ground, allowing the fluid to run out. If any of those methods won't work, give artificial respiration to get him going.


Artificial respiration is done by cupping your hands firmly over his mouth and nose and breathing into his one nostril steadily and gently, letting his chest rise, then fall, then breathing in again. Keep going until he can breathe on his own.
 The mare will lie there for around 10 to 20 minutes before she gets back up and starts cleaning off her new baby.


A few minutes of rest is Nature's way of making sure the foal gets his full blood supply from the placenta before the mare gets up and tears the umbilical cord.
 With a small jar of iodine, immerse the cord completely without spilling any on the foal.



If it takes longer than a couple hours for the mare to expel the placenta, call your vet immediately.

NEVER try to remove the afterbirth from the mare, as this could lead to serious uterine infection.
 It should look like a pair of trousers that has one leg smaller than the other (with the ends of the legs closed), and only one tear at the "waist" where the foal came through.


If any part of the placenta is missing, it'll usually be the tip of one of the "trouser legs."
If the placenta weighs more than 15 lb, it is abnormal and may be diseased, something that you should get your vet to check out for you.
