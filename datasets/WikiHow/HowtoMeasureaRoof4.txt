@summary
if your home is one story, add 1000 sq ft. you will be close.

 Let's say this is roughly 2000 sq/ft.
 In the example of 2000 sq/ft, you may have like 3000 sq ft of roof, or 30 squares as most roofers call them (1 square = 100 sq. ft).
 In the case mentioned before, your home could be like 2600 sq ft, or 26 squares. Again you will be very close.
