 Try to match up the necklines and the arm holes to the best of your ability. Although these shirts are in different sizes, you can see approximately how they will fit on your body.
 Use a fabric pen to draw the arcs.
 Cut along your pen lines with a rotary cutter or fabric scissors. A rotary cutter can make a more even arc with a practiced hand.
, You can either pin it or eye it and use an iron to fold the hem in slightly.
 Sew the armhole hems with a 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) seam allowance.
 Try on the t-shirt when it is inside out. Look to see if there are any gaps between the bust and the armpit.
 There will be more fabric nearer to the armpit than towards the bust. Pin this excess fabric to create your dart on 1 side.
 Pin the dart. Look into the mirror to ensure the darts look even.
