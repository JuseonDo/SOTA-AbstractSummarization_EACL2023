 Remember that it is inevitable that everyone will get their heart broken for the first time. Everyone has to go through this at some point or other. Tell yourself this every day.
 Understand that they can have their opinions and they can do what they want, ultimately it is their life.
 You tend to remember only the good things about them and the relationship, and may want to remember them as someone perfect, especially if they mean a lot to you, which they probably do. Keep this list somewhere you can read it whenever you start to wonder what you could’ve done to change things/where it all went wrong.
 Change your hair, buy new clothes, exercise, eat healthily etc. Remember all the compliments people have told you (yes, including your ex). Know that someone else will soon appreciate these traits in you, like your ex once did.
 These things help take you to another world.
