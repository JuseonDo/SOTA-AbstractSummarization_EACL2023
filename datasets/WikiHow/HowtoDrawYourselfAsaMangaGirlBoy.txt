 Make sure the picture is good because you'll need it later.;
,, You will need a clean piece of paper, a sharpened pencil (not a mechanical one), a big eraser, and a felt tip pen.
 It should be standing up (not sideways) and be about the size of the head in your picture.
 The space between the eyes should be about two times the size of the eyes.
,,, Use close together lines not chunky blocks of color. Hair should have a little sway to it; try to make your hairstyle like that.
, Draw a large circle in between the two curved lines on both the eyes and draw two shines in them (just two circles: one large, one small).
 Then, after the ink dries, erase everything so it is all cleaned up and looks nice.
