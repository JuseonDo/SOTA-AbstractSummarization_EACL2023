,, Then put spring onions (2 stalks, each cut into 2 sections), tea leaves, and ginger slices at the bottom of the bowl., Pour the rest of all sauces on the pork, and put the left 1 stalk of spring onion (cut into 2-3 sections) on top of the pork; add water at last.

The sauces are supposed cover the pork skin.


If you use cling film, it is good to make some holes on it.
 For most microwaves, 4 minutes high wave, 25 minutes low wave, and again 3 minutes high wave will do the trick.

After 25 minutes low wave, you can pause and check the pork. If it's becoming tender, change to high wave for 3 minutes; if not, keep low wave till it becomes tender before changing to high wave.
