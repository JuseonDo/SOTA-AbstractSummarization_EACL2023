, Open Golden Chests until you find the Handgun. You'll probably have to enter several dungeons, as the Handgun is fairly rare.
 You can create an Obsidian Generator or just naturally find it.
 This sounds absurd, but make a house, place a bed in it, and Set your Spawn Point to the house. Hell has lots of strong enemies and lava; too much exposure (which is more than likely) can kill you. It becomes a pain to navigate down to the Underworld again and again after you die, so just live there temporarily!

, To do this, you'll need a Nightmare Pickaxe/Deathbringer Pickaxe.


Easy method: Defeat the Eater of Worlds.
Easier way: Go onto one of your worlds that contains the Crimson. Summon the Brain of Cthulhu with the Vertebrae. Every third Crimson Heart you break will also summon it. Defeat it, and get Crimtane ore by repeating this. Craft a Nightmare/Deathbringer Pickaxe.
 You'll need 60 Hellstone ore.
 Find a Hellforge in one of them.
 You should have 20 Hellstone bars.
 Combine the Handgun and 20 Hellstone bars at the Iron/Lead anvil, and you'll get the Phoenix Blaster!
