 Add in guidelines, one long vertical and a couple of short horizontals where his eyes and mouth will be.
 Inside that, draw a circle for Plankton's pupil. Sketch in his single eyebrow.
 Each antenna should have four notches that go a bit outside the lines of the antennae. Draw thin ovals for Plankton's arms and legs.
 There you have it--Sheldon J. Plankton himself!

, It should look like a seed, or an especially long egg. This will serve as Plankton's body.;
, These should point outwards, and almost look like long, curved fangs coming out of his head.
 On each side of the middle of the body, draw a tubular shape with a circle at the end. Under the body oval draw two "V" shapes.
 Draw a big circle in the upper part of the oval. This will be Plankton's eye. Under the circle draw a dropped "D" shape. This will be the mouth.
 Draw the eye with and iris, an eyebrow above the eye, cheeks, and Plankton's teeth/tongue inside the mouth.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. Finally, erase any remaining pencil marks and color your Plankton as shown.
