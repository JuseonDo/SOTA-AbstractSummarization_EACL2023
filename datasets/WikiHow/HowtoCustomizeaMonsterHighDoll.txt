, Are you going to dye the hair, use a homemade doll wig made out of yarn or a live doll wig?

If you are going to dye the hair, do the following:






Get the dye. You can get the dye from just about any drugstores.






Put a plastic bag around your doll's face to protect the head from dye.






Put a washcloth around the doll's body.






Follow the instructions on the back of the dye.






Dye the doll's hair!








If you are going to use a wig, do this:






Buy a wig that fits the type of doll that you have. Most stores have them.






Pick a wig that looks like the sketch you made.






Cut off all the doll's hair.
Use tiny scissors to trim the head completely bald!
