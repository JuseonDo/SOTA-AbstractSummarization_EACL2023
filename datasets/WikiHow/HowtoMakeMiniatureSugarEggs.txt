, Mix through. The consistency should be like wet sand., Pack the sugar in hard. Level off using the palette knife., Let sit for 24 hours and the miniature sugar eggs will harden., After 24 hours, tip the egg mould sheet over the work surface and gently tap out the moulded egg halves. The egg halves will drop onto the work surface., Spread a thin layer over each flat edge of the egg and simply slide into place., Use the coloured royal icing to make dots, wiggly lines, letters and any designs you'd like. You can also stick on clean decorations such as little ribbon roses or similar, or edible decorations such as marzipan or fondant animals or flowers. Just make sure whatever you add doesn't overwhelm the small eggs., Add to a cake, cupcake, chocolate dessert or dessert pie top. Arrange as a display with Easter or similar items for a table centerpiece. You could also eat them but they're so sweet that few people will really enjoy them as a snack on their own!
