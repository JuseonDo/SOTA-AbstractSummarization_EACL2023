, Add the baking powder and flour and continue mixing. Pour in the almonds and fold them in.
 With floured hands, roll up each dough piece in a snake-like shape that is about the same length of your cookie sheet. Putting flour on your hands makes it easier for you to roll and the dough doesn't stick on them.
 Carefully, flatten each roll evenly so that they are about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
 Remove from the oven and let them cool on a cooling rack.
