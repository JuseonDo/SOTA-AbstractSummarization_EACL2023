 Your friend needs the support. Build up your friend's confidence to deal effectively with the bully.
 Once again, don't do this alone.
 Report and block so that it doesn't happen to you too. Tell your friend to report and block at the same time, so you can both stay safe.
 Your parents will probably be glad that you helped someone overcome bullying.
