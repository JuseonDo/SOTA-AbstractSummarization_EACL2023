, Cut into circles about 4-6 inches (10 - 15 cm) in diameter and lightly flour them.
 Mince the onions and garlic, and add to the pan. Cook until the onions become translucent.
 Break it up with a spoon and cook, stirring until lightly browned. Drain off fat.
, Carefully mix into the meat mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste.
, Place 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Dampen the outer perimeter of the dough.
 Pinch a corner of the dough, and then fold that section onto itself. Pinch and pull out another 1/2-inch (1.2 cm) section and fold over, so it slightly overlaps the first piece. Repeat along the length of the folded side, until you create a braided or twisted seal.
 Bake 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
