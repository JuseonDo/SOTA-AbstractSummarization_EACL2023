 These capture applications will playback the video using the necessary player/DRM, such as Amazon's Unbox player or iTunes, and record the stream as it plays. (This is not a trivial process, and capturing full sized HD videos will require a fast multi-core processor and at least 4GB of RAM. See the support/forums section of the software package for more specific information.;
, Then browse to and select the files.
 To change the size and quality of the output file click the "Settings" button. You can (and should) customize the output settings for the specific playback purpose (TV, iPod/iPad, smart phone, etc.).
 Once the capture is completed the application will finish the encoding process producing a final output file that does not contain the DRM. This is the same process that will work for many different kinds of DRM video, including iTunes.
