 Costs of living are different in each country.;
, What degrees do you need, if any, Certifications, immunizations, etc. Also, if you will be able to practice your religion there.
 But keep in mind that many listings are still located in English newspapers within each country. You may also find the best jobs are not well advertised but posted at Foreign Language schools, but do not rely exclusively on the possibility of a "walk in" job -- line something up before you leave home.
 If you don't know anyone, find forums online and join in the discussions.
 You will need to comply with local self-employment laws. you can advertise your services on a website, in free Internet classifieds, local newspapers, and social networking sites. be sure to have your advertising professionally translated into the local language if you aren't confident of your own second language skills.
 At the very least, have an English Only dictionary, a picture dictionary, an MP3 recorder, and a quality grammar book. Having Internet access, a laptop, and access to free media helps even more.
