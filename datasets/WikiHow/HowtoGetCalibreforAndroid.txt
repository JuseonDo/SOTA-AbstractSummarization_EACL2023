 You'll need the Calibre Companion  app as well as an ebook reader app installed in order to sync and read your ebook library.
 There's a free version called CCDemo and the paid Calibre Companion app. The free version allows you to sync up to twenty books at a time, while the paid version has no restrictions.

Calibre Companion is not an official app, but it is developed by one of the calibre developers and is recommended by the calibre development team.
Calibre Companion and CCDemo are the only calibre apps that work with this method.
 Before shelling out for the paid version, use CCDemo to test your network.

The rest of the guide will refer to the app as Calibre Companion, but the process is the same for both the free and paid versions.

Moon+ Reader
FBReader
AlReader
Universal Book Reader
