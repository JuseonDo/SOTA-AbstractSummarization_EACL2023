, A new window will open. Find your ZEN player in the left-hand panel. It should automatically load your player and direct you to the "Media Library" folder.
 Access your music files either by clicking Music underneath Media Library in the left-hand panel, or double-clicking Music in the main window.
 You can copy the first track either by dragging and dropping it into a specified folder on your computer (in this example, the Desktop) or other medium.


Or you can right-click the file, scroll to and click "Copy",and then move to a blank area on your folder, right-click, scroll down to and click "Paste."

, Open Creative MediaSource. Locate the target folder on your hard drive or other media, and find the song you just added. Once you have found the file, right-click it and scroll down to "Edit Track Properties."

, Go back to ZEN Media Explorer. Locate the song on your player that you wish to re-load. Either delete it and replace the song, or re-copy it to the player, answering "Yes" to the prompt that you want to replace a file with the same name.
 Scroll to Music, then Albums. Press the context menu button and scroll down to "Switch View." Press down on the D-pad until you see the album. If everything worked, you should see the new album art. If not, try the next method.
