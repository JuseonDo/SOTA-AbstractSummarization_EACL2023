A centrifugal juicer is great at juicing hard fruit and vegetables. It is not so good at extracting high yields of juice from leafy greens.
If you plan to juice mostly leafy greens (spinach, parsley, wheat grass) a twin gear juicer or a masticating juicer is more suitable for this job.;
, If you're you short for time, look for a centrifugal juicer that does the job fast.


A twin gear juicer and a masticating juicer are slower, but they do a more efficient job at extracting high yields of juice.
 This type of juicer allows for juicing whole carrots, beets and apples.
 You can take your juicer along if you purchase a compact juicer. These are so light you can put them in your backpack.
 Are you juicing for the whole family? Skip the compact juicers and look for a powerful motor with a long warranty.
