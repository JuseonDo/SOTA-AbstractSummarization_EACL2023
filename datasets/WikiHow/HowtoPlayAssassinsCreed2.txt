 It makes your missions easier.
 If you do something high profile, then they will notice.



You can blend in with scholars, group of citizens on the street, and by sitting on benches between two people.
You can hide in haystacks, rooftop gardens, wells, moving peddler's cargos, bushes, etcetera.
Note that intelligent guards (captains, jagers, seekers, agiles) may search those hiding spots, except bushes, to find you.
 You can also throw money while being chased to attract citizens nearby, thus the slowing the guard down.
 You can use other ways to lure them away, like:


Hiring courtesans and have them flirting with guards.
Using thieves, recruits to harass them.
Hiring mercenaries.
Dropping a dead body nearby (be careful not to be seen carrying a body).
