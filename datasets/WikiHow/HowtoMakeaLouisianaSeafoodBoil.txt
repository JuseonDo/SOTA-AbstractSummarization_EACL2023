, Your shrimp will have a natural arch to it so cut along the middle of the inner arch up to the tip of the tail where the intestinal tract is. From the cut, a black line (the shrimp's vein) will become visible. Remove the vein with your hands or a fork and wash the shrimp under running water. Repeat this step for every shrimp you have.
 This cuts down on the fishy scent., Do not use them if they are. The smell and broken shell is an indicator that they are rotten. You want your mussels to be tightly closed., On a mussel, there is the beard-like attachment hanging off of it. You can either pull this off or cut it off. Once you have debearded the mussel, take a scouring pad or a stiff brush and scrub off any barnacles that are attached to the mussel. Repeat this for all of your mussels and wash them together under running water.
 This ensures that debris, like sand, is still clinging to the legs.,

Always store your crayfish on ice to preserve freshness, when you're not cooking with them.
 Repeat for the remaining sausages., Peal the green part off the corn to reveal the inside. Continue to pull the stringy material off of the corn cob and then rinse.
