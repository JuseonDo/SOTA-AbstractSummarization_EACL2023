 Remember that each of us has something -- a hobby, a skill, a family history, etc. that will interest others. Whether you choose your own speech or are assigned a topic, the steps are the same. Tell the audience what your topic is, make your speech, and summarize your speech.;
, Then research your topic. Be sure your facts are accurate, and always try to avoid plagiarizing.
 Don't worry if you get too much information, you can discard what you don't need or want to use. Having more information is better than not having enough information.
 Ask them to help you time how long it takes for you to make your speech if you have time limitations. Your teacher can help you with how long the speech is expected to be.
 On this card, write down the key points so that you can go back to them if you forget anything while you are speaking. Do not read an entire speech from what you wrote. Speaking extemporaneously with only the little cheat card for help adds credibility and sincerity to your presentation.
, Then tell them all the interesting things you've learned and they may not know. Make eye contact with the audience.
 For instance, if your speech is about catfish farms, you might end by repeating how many there are in the United States and why catfish farming is important.
