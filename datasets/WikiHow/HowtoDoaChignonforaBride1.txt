 Use styling products that will ensure total smoothness of your hair. Comb your hair before commencing.;
, Pull these two pieces together at the middle and tie with a clear elastic to form the miniature ponytail. Don't pull too tightly; there should be plenty of space in the side pieces.
 This is the only part of the hair that will stay messy because it serves as the filling inside the chignon, to help keep the chignon rounded.
 This should be a few inches or centimeters from the base of your hair.
 Pull it through the top ponytail carefully and neatly.
 Ensure that the teased part of the top ponytail is also neatly tucked under and is helping to hold out the chignon. Secure the chignon in place using bobby pins or clips.
 This look needs to be kept strong with spray, so be generous.
 If adding flowers or other decorative effects to your hair, do so after the chignon has been made. It is recommended that the chignon be the starring feature though, so don't overdo any decorations.
