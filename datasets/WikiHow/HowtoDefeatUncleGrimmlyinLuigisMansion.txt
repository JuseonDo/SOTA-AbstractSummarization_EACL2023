 After you use it, lightning will strike, causing a blackout. Go down the hall, and go to the door on the very bottom at the right. This will lead to the telephone room.;
, It shouldn't take long at all, and once it rings, Toad will answer and talk about a power generator in the Breaker Room. Once the second telephone rings, E. Gadd will answer. He will talk about a ghost named Uncle Grimmly who only comes out when it's dark, and how he likes mirrors. You may think that Uncle Grimmly is in the mirror room, but he's in the wardrobe room. Go to that room.
 In order to defeat Uncle Grimmly, you need to look away. After a while, Uncle Grimmly will tend to try to make a "scary" face. Once this happens, his heart is exposed.
, Open it to get a key to the breaker room.
