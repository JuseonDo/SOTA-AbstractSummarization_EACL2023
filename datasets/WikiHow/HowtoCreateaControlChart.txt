@summary
check to see that your data meets the following criteria:

@summary
data should usually be normally distributed revolving around a mean (average).

@summary
find the mean of each subgroup.

@summary
find the mean of all of the means from the previous step (x).

@summary
calculate the standard deviation (s) of the data points (see tips).

@summary
,

@summary
calculate the upper and lower control limits (ucl, lcl) using the following formula:

@summary
ucl = cl + 3*s

@summary
lcl = cl – 3*s

@summary
the formula represents 3 standard deviations above and 3 standard deviations below the mean respectively.

@summary
,

@summary
refer to the below chart with steps 7 through 10.

@summary
,

@summary
draw a line at each deviation.

@summary
graph the x-bar control chart, by graphing the subgroup means (x-axis) verses measurements (y-axis).

@summary
evaluate the graph to see if the process is out-of-control.state whether the system is in-control or out-of-control.

In the example below, a bottle company fills their bottles to 16 oz. (mean); they are evaluating if their process is “in-control”. The amount in ounces over 16 oz. is normally distributed around the mean.


Measurements need to be independent of one another.

In the example, the measurements are in subgroups. The data in the subgroups should be independent of the measurement number; each data point will have a subgroup and a measurement number.

;
,


To find the mean, add all measurements in the subgroup and divide by the number of measurements in the subgroup.

In the example, there are 20 subgroups and in each subgroup there are 4 measurements.



This will give you the overall mean of all the data points.
The overall mean will be the centerline in the graph (CL), which is 13.75 for our example.
,,,


In the above example, there is a line drawn at one, two, and three standard deviations (sigma’s) away from the mean.

Zone C is 1 sigma away from the mean (green).
Zone B is 2 sigma away from the mean (yellow).
Zone A is 3 sigma away from the mean (red).
 Your graph should look like something like this:, The graph is out-of-control if any of the following are true:

Any point falls beyond the red zone (above or below the 3-sigma line).
8 consecutive points fall on one side of the centerline.
2 of 3 consecutive points fall within zone A.
4 of 5 consecutive points fall within zone A and/or zone B.
15 consecutive points are within Zone C.
8 consecutive points not in zone C.
