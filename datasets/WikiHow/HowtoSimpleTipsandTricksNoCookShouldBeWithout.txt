 Cauliflower has a kind of bland taste that mixes well with potatoes and the other ingredients in them. Cauliflower is also the same texture and color of potatoes when mashed so it's a great way to add more veggies, while lowering calories from classic mashed potatoes;
, When you cook a simple meal, use fresh seasonings and herbs.
 Dried herbs like oregano are better with dishes that are complex.
 When creating soup and stew, try making it lower in fat content by using stocks that have the fat already removed from them. Soup is also lower in fat when it includes veggies and lean meat.
 Once the soup is done and ready to eat, let it chill in the refrigerator for a little while. Any excess fat will harden and rise to the top.
 The calorie savings is around 100 per tablespoon you remove.
, For the most nutritious vegetables, employ fast cooking methods or, better yet, consume raw veggies.
 Before you cook any ground meat, blot up any excess moisture. It is always wise to blot any moisture that is present on ground meat. If your meat is too moist, then it can affect how it cooks. Basically it just burns away. This can cause the meat to become steamed instead of seared as it should be.
 Always take good care of your wooden cutting board. If you don't keep your wooden cutting board moderately dry and in a cool place, you may find that it warps or cracks. A wooden cutting board will be ruined if it is placed into water.


To restore a damaged board, oil it on a regular basis, using a product specifically designed for wood cutting boards.
Allow your board to dry completely between uses.
 Place any unripened fruit that you buy in a plastic bag that is perforated. As some fruits become more ripe, they can produce ethylene gas.


If you put them in the bag with holds the air will go through the bag, and the gas will stay in, helping the fruits retain their wonderful taste.
 Once you've done this, you can cook the rest of the meat or add additional seasoning as you see fit.
