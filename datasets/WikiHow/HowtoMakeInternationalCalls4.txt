Calling cards are available at supermarkets, drugstores and in stores like Walmart and Target. You can examine the details on the back to see how many cents per minute you will pay to the country to which you are calling.
Choose the calling card price by the allotted prepaid limits. Try to choose how many minutes you will be speaking to the country to get a good bargain.
 This is usually a 1-800 number that you call into first before dialing your international number.
 These are the ID numbers associated with your purchased calling card.
 When prompted, dial your card ID number. It should tell you how many minutes remain on your account.
 Wait to hear the call start ringing on the other end. If it does not work, read the back of the calling card carefully for special instructions.
