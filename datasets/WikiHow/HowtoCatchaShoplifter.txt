Ask yourself if any of your sales floor is hidden from the employees' sight at any point during the day.
Ask yourself if you keep a large enough staff during the busiest hours or during the hectic holiday season.
Determine if your staff frequently finds hangers or loose price tags on the floor.
Analyze if your store is one with an industry-wide problem including the shoe industry, music stores, sporting goods stores and stores that sell cameras.;
,


Keep an eye out large open bags, particularly ones that are resting at the feet of a shopper.
Watch customers with large purses carefully.
Stay on the lookout for customers that bring a baby carriage into the store. Some shoplifters not only use baby carriages, but they also install false bottoms to hold more loot.
, If there is a discrepancy in the numbers, there may be an indication that shoplifting has taken place because many shoplifters will simply layer stolen clothing under their existing attire.
, This allows to have more people than employees so that at least one of them can stay unattended by your staff.
 The thief then steals from the store and departs before the employee comes back to the front of the store.



Hire a security staff to deter shoplifters and to be in charge of catching them.
Install closed circuit cameras to aid in the identification and prosecution of shoplifters with the police. Having the proof to provide to the authorities will help you catch and prosecute the offenders.
 Most businesses do not allow staff to approach suspected shoplifters. Instead they must report incidences to the proper authority.
 If you suspect a shoplifter has left your store, then they can be aware and more cognizant if that individual or group enters their store. The expectation would be that they would share the same warnings with you.
