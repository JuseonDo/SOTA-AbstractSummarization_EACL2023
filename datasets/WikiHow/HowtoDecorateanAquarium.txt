Some fish and water-dwelling animals are sensitive to chemicals or paint that could be on some ornaments. Others prefer specific bottom coverings, such as small stones for burrowing and hiding.






For example, fish that originate from shallow bodies of water prefer light covering such as plants, while fish from deep water do best with rocks, wood and sturdy decorations.





;
, Make sure that your ornaments are big enough for the species of fish that you have. Also, check your pieces for sharp corners and rough edges.
,


Larger items should go toward the sides and back of the tank, while shorter ones look best in the front.
Consider placing a focal point, such as a large rock, plant or ornament with a bubbler, in the center of the aquarium.
Some items might need washed prior to usage. Certain types of ornamentation will need assembled.

Strategically place items to hide aquarium heaters, tubing and lines for a more attractive look.
