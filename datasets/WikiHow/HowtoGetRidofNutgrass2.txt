 You will need to dig into the dirt quite a bit using this method, and gardening gloves should reduce the amount of dirt you get on your skin and under your nails.
 Dig down as far as you can go. Nut grass root systems can extend as deep down as 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimeters) below the surface.
 Doing this gently is vital to reduce the number of roots that break off, as well as the number of pieces those roots break into.
 If any roots remain, there is still some chance that the nut grass can return.
 Dispose of the weeds in your trash. Do not throw them into a pile or into a compost heap, since you may end up spreading them into another area of your lawn by doing so.
