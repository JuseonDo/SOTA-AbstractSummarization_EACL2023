@summary
import into adobe after effects.

@summary
select the solid layer and push "mm" on the keyboard.

@summary
move forwards a couple frames at a time and let the computer fill the frames between, but touch-ups are almost always necessary.

@summary
once the entire footage is rotoscoped (edited frame by frame), click the solid layer and push "ctrl + d" 4 times.

@summary
delete the footage from the composition.

@summary
create a new composition and adjust the size so it matches the first composition.

@summary
apply the "color balance" effect to the first comp layer.

@summary
enjoy the realistic effect this method makes!

 A great way to create one cheaply is to go to a store and buy a toy lightsaber. Take off the top of the toy and remove the plastic blade.;
, Buy rubber tubing that fits snugly around the dowel. Replace the top of the toy and insert the tubing. Insert the dowel into the tubing.
 Screw the handle, tube and dowel together.
,, Drag into the composition. Create a solid white layer over the footage. click the eye to make it see-through. Using the pen tool, click the corners of the lightsaber on the first frame. Connect to make a box. You should see a white mask over the lightsaber prop.
 Click the stopwatch next to "Mask Path" Go on tho the next frame and drag the corners of the mask so it fits the lightsaber (make sure the pointer and white solid layer is selected).
 If the lightsaber is blurred, make the mask over the entire blur.
 You cannot edit the mask after this. Go to each layer and push "MM" adjust the "Mask Feather" to 5 for the first layer, 10 for the second, 15 for the third, 25 for the fourth and 40 for the fifth layer.
 Create a solid black layer under the white solid layers.
 Drag the footage into the composition. Drag the first composition into the new composition on top of the footage. They should align. For first comp layer, under "mode" change the blending mode to "screen".
 Adjust the highlight and midtone colors until you get the appropriate lightsaber color. Make sure to check "Preserve Luminosity"

, Rotoscoping is the only way!
