 If you need to, put your shirt on first. You are making the shirt longer, because you will be folding the hem twice to conceal the raw edges and prevent fraying.


This method may work with other non-button-up shirts made from woven material, such as tunics and peasant blouses.
 Spread your shirt out on a flat surface in front of you, with the inside facing you. Draw a line along the bottom edge of the shirt. Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt to the line that you are drawing. This will ensure that the line is an even distance from the bottom edge of the shirt. Most button-up shirts have a curved hem, so your line should curve as well.If you want your shirt to have a flat bottom, simply draw a line straight across the bottom of the shirt. Align it with the shortest part of the shirt, usually at the side seams.
, You are folding the hem up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), so the first line that you drew should now be inside the hem, right along the crease., Make sure that you are using a heat setting that is suitable for the material you are working with.
 This will give you a clean, professional-looking hem. The raw edges should now be concealed inside the hem., An easy way to do this is to align the edge of the sewing machine's foot with the bottom edge of the shirt. Remove pins as you sew, and be sure to use a thread color that matches the fabric of your shirt.


Remember to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing. If your shirt is not a button-up shirt, start sewing at one of the side seams. This will conceal the beginning and ending of your sewing better.
 Your shirt is now ready to wear!
