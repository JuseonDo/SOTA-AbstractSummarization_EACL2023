 This will help your body fight off a cold that you may be getting or that you already have. The clove nutmeg has antiviral properties.
 This herb is antiseptic and aromatic.


Look for a spritzer bottle that contains lavender oil mixed with lavender hydrosol. Spray it on your face and hands when you are around people with colds, and use it on yourself when you have a cold to protect others from catching your virus.
 Herbs such as eucalyptus, black spruce, chamomile, peppermint and rosemary can be used in the diffuser or the humidifier to clear nasal passages, soothe headaches and make you feel better.
