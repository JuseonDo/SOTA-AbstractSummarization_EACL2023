@article
 This will take you to the Citibank site specifically for Sears Card holders.;
,, This will also allow you to make payments to this specific card. This information will include the Sears Card account number, Social Security number (or at least the last 4 digits to verify your identity), the card's security code, your email address, and your billing zip code.


,, This information can be found on the bottom of your personal checks.


Checking Account Number: The numbers located at the bottom near the middle of the checks. Your checking account number is the front number (usually a 10-digit number) in the series; the actual check number is the 4-digit number that follows this and is separated by a small symbol.
Routing Number: This is the number located on the bottom left hand side of your checks. This is usually a 9- digit number.
 Make sure these are both easy to remember, but also make sure the password is difficult enough to keep your account and all your information secure. The best way to do this is to choose a password that contains numbers, upper and lowercase letters, and symbols.
 This will heighten your safety and security for your online Sears Card account.
, Underneath where you type your password you will see a drop down menu. Click on the arrows and select "Make a Payment," then press the "Sign On" button.
 Choose the checking account you would like to use from the drop down menu. Key in the date in which you would like the payment to be processed then press "Continue."

, If all is correct, press "Make Payment." The payment should process on the selected date.
