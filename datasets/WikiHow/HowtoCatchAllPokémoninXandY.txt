 You need both games to catch all the Pokémon.;
, You need to have lots of them ready.
 First use moves to make its hit points really low but don't let it get to zero. The move False Swipe can be really useful because it will not go lower than 1 hit point.
 Try not to poison or burn it, though, because it might lose all its hit points before you catch it.


Once the hit points are low, throw poke balls at it until you capture it.
 Go through tall grass, short grass, flowers, and caves. Lots of Pokémon will pop out, but you will have to walk around a lot too. Find rare Pokémon. Don't rush through the areas.
 If you see a body of water surf around to find more Pokémon. Also go fishing with a fishing rod; this will bring out different Pokémon.
 Some will offer trades; always take the trades because they usually offer Pokémon that you can't find elsewhere in the game.
 If you can't find the evolved version, many will have to be evolved.
 Choose one to be your main game and use the other game to find the extra Pokémon not in your main game and trade them.
