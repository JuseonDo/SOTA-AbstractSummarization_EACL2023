 There are numerous varieties:

Brown boronia (Boronia megastigma) - heavenly scent and bell shaped flowers - you can't let its root zone dry out or it will die



 


Other varieties include Purple Jared, Lutea, Jack MacQuire's Red, Sunset Serenade, Harlequin, etc.






It is recommended for the best success that you select one that is native to your local area.;
, Boronias do best under dappled light. They also tend to grow best near the coast rather than in inland gardens.
 Most boronias need to grow where there will be plenty of moist soil that drains well. To help the plant stay moist, mulch the area really well.
, Provide shade, if needed, during very hot spells.
 Do a light prune after the boronia has flowered.
