, Some people find it easier to cut the peaches into edges first, then peel the skins off using a knife. Once you have the peaches cut into wedges, you can slice them up thinner., You can use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to do this. Make sure that you are only using ¼ cup (55 grams) of white sugar and ¼ cup (50 grams) of brown sugar; you'll using the rest later. Toss everything together until the peaches are evenly coated with sugar and spices.,, Put the flour into a large mixing bowl, then add ¼ cup (55 grams) of white sugar and ¼ cup (50 grams) of brown sugar. Add the baking powder and salt, and stir to combine., You can do this using a pastry blender, a food processor, two knives, or even your fingertips. You want the "grains" to be about the size of small peas., Do not over-stir the batter. You just want it to be evenly soaked so that it holds together., Using a pair of oven mitts, take the baking dish out of the oven, and set it down on a heat-safe surface. Drop the batter evenly across the peaches with a large spoon., Stir together 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of white sugar and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon in a small bowl until the cinnamon is evenly distributed throughout the sugar., Use a small teaspoon to do this. This way, you'll have better control over how much cinnamon-sugar you are sprinkling., It is ready when the top turns golden-brown. If it is still not done, bake it for another 15 minutes or so., You can serve it as it is or you can add some cream or vanilla ice cream.
