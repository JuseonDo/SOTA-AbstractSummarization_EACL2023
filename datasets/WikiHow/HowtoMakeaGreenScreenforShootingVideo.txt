@summary
decide how much you want to spend and what type of green screen you want; either hard or soft.

@summary
to create a hard green screen, simply paint a solid material (balsa wood or cardboard) green and still get the same outcome.

@summary
to create a soft screen, buy light, bright green material from a sewing or crafts shop.

@summary
when you hang the screen (if you choose the soft option), there are several ways that you can do this.

@summary
if you want your screen to be mobile, you will need two frames such as hat stands.

@summary
when traveling with your screen, ensure that you roll it up rather than folding it, otherwise you'll get creases which will upset the consistency of the colour.

, Or, you can paint a smooth wall.
 Make sure the material isn't light weighted or transparent as it will disrupt colour when the lights are on it.


There is no recommended size - just as long as it completely fills the screen

The first, you can tack it to a wall.
Second, attach a curtain rod to a wall and hang the screen from that. Remember, if you do this, you will need to make sure a strip drapes along the floor so that you can weigh it down with heavy objects.
 Prop the curtain rod up across the frames and hang the screen from that. Again, let a strip hang along the floor and weigh it down.



To roll it up evenly and tightly, roll it around a hard/heavy cylindrical object with a diameter or about 2-4".
 You'll also need to light the screen differently on your subjects. Your best bet would be to set up a 500-300w light at each vertical side pointing inwards and then two spaced evenly apart along the bottom pointing up (these should be 100-250w).
