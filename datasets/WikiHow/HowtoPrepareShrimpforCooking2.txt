@summary
prepare fresh shrimp using the same steps as for frozen shrimp by removing the shell and the veins.
@article
 The only difference is the smell of fresh shrimp.

If you smell something that smells like ammonia, this is shrimp to avoid.






Otherwise, prepare the fresh shrimp the same way as you would frozen shrimp; removing the shell/head, tail optional, and the vein.
