 If you are hesitant to replace your children's plastic dishware with glass for fear it'll become broken, purchase plastic labeled as BPA-free.;
, Cooking utensils made from plastic have the potential to melt, or break down slightly into your food when cooking.
 Examples of common storage containers you should replace are clear plastic wrap, plastic sandwich bags, and plastic leftover containers.
 When you slice into items on the cutting board, plastic remnants from the cutting board have the potential to enter and contaminate your food. Glass cutting boards are also a safe alternative to plastic, but can cause your knives to dull at a faster pace. Wood cutting boards are great as well but must be properly sterilized after use.
 Water filters can turn your tap water into healthier water that is free of pollutants and other chemicals, and can help you save the money you normally spend on bottled water.
 A variety of manufacturers also develop BPA-free plastic water bottles for on-the-go convenience.
 The plastic that resides in containers and wrappers may already have contaminated your food before you purchased it.


Bring your own reusable grocery bags if your supermarket does not contain BPA-free plastic bags or containers for produce items. Reusable grocery bags are a green alternative that can lower the risk of your food becoming contaminated by plastic bags.
 Although non-stick coating can make your cooking experience relatively easier, the chemicals present in non-stick coating have been found to cause adverse health effects. Well seasoned cast iron is a great replacement for non-stick skillets.
