 Make some oatmeal, then stir in one or two drops of yellow or green food coloring.
 Use raisins, corn kernels, or ripped pasta for chunks, but I don't advise putting these in if it is supposed to be cat barf.
 Only drop a few spoonfuls in ONE PLACE on the carpet. If you want it to smell icky, garlic sauce and a little old cheese work well.
