 You should balance carbohydrates, proteins, and fat.;
, Serving up cut vegetables with a side of ranch or peanut butter or cut fruit with yogurt are simple but nutritious options.
 Let them choose snacks at the grocery store. This is a great lesson as it teaches your child how to make healthy choices and how to be independent.
 Such snacks include fruits like bananas, apples, and grapes. You can also prepare snacks in advance like cut up carrots or celery sticks.
 Don't cut them out altogether though. Unlike healthy kid friendly snacks, don't make unhealthy snacks readily available, but rather take control of when and how much is served. Don't deprive your children of junk food as this will make unhealthy snacks more desirable. An unhealthy snack can be included in your selection at least once a week to teach your child about moderation.
 You can create a 3 week cycle so you know in advance what to shop for and serve. Where one day you can offer cheese with grapes, another you can serve crackers with peanut butter. Other suggestions include carrot sticks with hummus, snack mix with raisins, nuts, and cereal, cut banana with low-fat yogurt, and graham crackers with Nutella.
 Cut veggies into fun shapes, cut sandwiches with cookie cutters, serve up cut fruit on kabob skewers, or arrange snacks into a funny face. These tips will make eating healthy more fun.
 Not only is it an excuse to bond with your children, it is an opportunity to practice what you preach. You can show your children that snacking healthy is a way of life.
 Nutritionists often recommend eating 5 times day with a snack between breakfast and lunch and another snack between lunch and dinner. With this in mind, the portions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner should be smaller.
