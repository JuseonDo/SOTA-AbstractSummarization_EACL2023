 This will help you. Remember they are what the bifauxnen style emulates.;
, Look for men's slacks, pants, ties, suits, cuff links, watches, shirts and jewelry. Keep it classy and expensive looking. Even if you just spend 12.99 on one shirt, nobody should be able to tell by looking at your outfit. Be very careful that your clothes fit your body well. They shouldn't be too tight but the worst mistake would be to buy them too large. Baggy jeans and tees may sound like a good idea but lack the sophistication bifauxnen girls are trademarked for.
 The trick is to wear it in ways that does not enhance your femininity but instead confuses people even more about your gender!

, Take a long look at Annie Lennox in the 80's and you'll see why. Just do like the last step and make sure your make-up obscures the fact you're female, not enhances it.
).
 Don't be afraid that you look like you spent some time on your appearance- you don't have to look like you just rolled out of bed and out the door to be androgynous.
 It isn't classy and doesn't make you seem boyish-just annoying!

, Belching, bad table manners and bad hygiene are unacceptable. Would a bishounen boy have these bad habits? Most certainly not! A bifauxnen-like her male counterpart-won't tolerate ungentlemanly behavior.
