 Usually the best person to pick is the person with the most experience.;
, The moderator will go around the circle of people and tap people on the head based on the role in the game the moderator thinks they should play.


Tap on the head: Informant
Tap on the head: Mafia
If you didn't get tapped then you are an innocent person.

Games with 6-10 people playing should have 1 informant and 1 mafia member.
Games with 10-15 people playing should have 3 informants and 2 mafia members.
