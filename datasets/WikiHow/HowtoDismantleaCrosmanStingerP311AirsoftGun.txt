 If so, get the BB's out safely by shooting it at a target without the clip in or manually ejecting the BB.;
,, Be careful not to damage the catch in any way.



Now the three loose pieces should only be the slide, the lower frame, and the catch, which is loose.



Be careful with the thumb-side grip (for righties) as it keeps the spring loaded safety in place.
 Don't lose any of the pieces.
 This will cause the back of the gun (which counters the trigger spring) to pivot back around the base of the butt.
 Have fun, but don't do anything stupid. You should only take it apart if you want to grease it, or study the innards. Don't do anything you can't reverse, or you're left with a useless waste of money. Remember you should always put it back together when you are done, but you don't have to.
