 Starting from the bottom of the head, take an inch or two of hair and figure out its naturally inclined direction - this will usually be going straight out from the head.;
, Depending on your hair texture, you might have to go over it again.
 Smaller sections = tighter curls) and place the flat iron about a third of the way down.
 The faster and tighter you twist the iron, the tighter the curls are going to be. Repeat until satisfied, working bottom to top.
 This works mainly with the layered hairstyles that just don't look good when left untouched. Figure out what works for you face shape and length. This works best with straight hair. Basically, there is not a single 'rule' when it comes to styling your hair with edge. It all depends on you, but for basic layers this works well. Starting with the hair framing your face, take small sections of hair, and close the iron onto the hair about two thirds down, and with a swift motion, sweep and flip the iron so you have a flippy piece of hair framing your face. Do the same on both sides. After this, use the same technique, except varying how much hair you take and how far down you start the flip. This works well on the sides of the head, the back can simply be left or flipped slightly. The closer to the bottom the hair is flipped, the edgier.
