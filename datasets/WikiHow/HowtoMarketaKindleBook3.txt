 Advertise your book on your blog, social networks and forums, to concentrate a surge of traffic that may push your book into the charts.
,, These could include a portrait of yourself grinning over a Kindle, or artwork related to your cover. Post these online.
 This could be something simple like a blog post that people can comment on, or something more elaborate like a Skype chat.
 However, if you know that you're guaranteed readers, full price may be a better business decision.
 However, avoid back to back posts as that is poor etiquette and in some cases, it is not allowed.
 Post reviews on Amazon and write blog posts linking to your reviews. Be careful to include keywords about the books, as well as their titles and authors' names. This means that people searching for related authors may end up at your blog, where you can promote your book.
