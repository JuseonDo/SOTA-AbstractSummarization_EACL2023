 In the pan below, add 5cm/2 inches of boiling water.


Quartered potatoes can be steamed but will usually need to be parboiled first, to prevent them from falling apart. Since this is a lot of effort, it's of questionable value to quarter the potatoes unless it's for a very specific dish.
 Boil the water for 20-40 minutes, allowing the steam to penetrate the potatoes.


Keep an eye on the water and top it up if necessary.
 Push a bamboo or metal skewer through the potatoes; if it goes right through, the potatoes are cooked.
,, Place this into the oven in the rack underneath the potato rack.
, This method will cook the potatoes in about one hour.


Occasionally check the water amount. Top up if needed.
 The potatoes are ready when a skewer passes through them easily.
