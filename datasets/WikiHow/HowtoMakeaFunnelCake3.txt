 Boil 1 cup of water, 6 tbsp. of butter, 1 tbsp. of granulated sugar, 1 tbsp. of brown sugar, and 1/8 tsp. of salt together in a saucepan., Stir the ingredients until they are thoroughly incorporated. The dough should form a ball.
 This will slightly thicken the ingredients.
 Add all four eggs to the ingredients, one at a time, waiting for one egg to be completely incorporated before adding the next egg to the mixture. When you're finished, the mixture should be nice and smooth.
 This will give the funnel cake the perfect thickness.
 Wait at least one minute for the oil to heat up.
 You can swirl the dough, criss cross it, or just create a free-form pattern. Make the funnel cake pattern about ten inches wide. You can repeat this process with the excess batter later.
 Cook the first side for 3-4 minutes until it's brown and then use a spatula to flip it over to the other side. Cook the other side until it's brown too -- this should take at least another minute.
 Use a spatula to move the dough onto a plate covered with a paper towel and wait at least one minute for the excess oil to drain onto the paper towel.
 Add as much sugar as you'd like.
 Enjoy this tasty extra sweet funnel cake while it's hot.
