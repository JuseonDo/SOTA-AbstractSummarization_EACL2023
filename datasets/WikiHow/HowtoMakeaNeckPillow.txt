, Most fabrics will work for this project, but softer textiles will be more comfortable on your neck. Flannel or soft knits work well; recycle an old shirt for a "green" option.

 Pin them together. Cut out the pattern.
 Stitch around the pillow, leaving one of the short ends open.
 Turn the pillow right side out.
