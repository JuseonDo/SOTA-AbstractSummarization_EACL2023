A box with a list of settings will appear. Enable or Disable JavaScript is the last option. Select "Enable".
 Once you have checked that JavaScript is enabled in your browser, open the JavaScript Console, which is part of the Chrome Developer Tools.
 Select More tools --> Developer Tools, and it will open the console in the browser that you are currently using. Make sure the Console tab is selected.
 If there is anything in the Console, type clear() and it will clear the Console. Type alert("Hello World");  and press enter. An alert box should pop up in the browser with the message you typed. You can put any words you want in between the quotes.


If you want to add an alert to an html file you can add it by using a script tag.
