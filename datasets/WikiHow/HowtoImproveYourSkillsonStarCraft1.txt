@summary
always pick a race that suits you best.build a lot of scv's/drones/probes and spread a few across the map so in case you are attacked you can build a new base

Terran is the most mechanically demanding race, and they are best for slowly pushing and strong defense and walling-off. Terrans are generally the most inflexible in their build, and they have medium unit cost.






Protoss is generally regarded as the easiest to learn, with a balance of mechanics and strategy. Their units are generally more powerful but also more expensive. They have a medium level of army mobility and map control.






Zerg is the most strategically heavy race, and therefore is more difficult for newcomers. They have a highly flexible economic structure with a need for high map control and many expansions. Their units are generally weaker but less expensive.
