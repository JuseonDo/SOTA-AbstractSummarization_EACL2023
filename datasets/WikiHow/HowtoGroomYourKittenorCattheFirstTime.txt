, Make sure that the brush is a thin and strong brush. The bristles should be flexible but strong, and they should be fine in width.
 If the brush has your scent on it, your cat will calm down. An added benefit of doing this is that you can check that it is not too hard for use.
 If the cat does not try to bite the comb, proceed to the next step, if it does attack the comb, leave it be and try again the next day. Repeat until your kitten or cat accepts the brush.
 Do not brush hard, it could hurt your kitten or cat. Run the brush down its back, and try to brush down its legs. It is easier to do this when your cat is laying down. Brush its legs, but not its paws.
