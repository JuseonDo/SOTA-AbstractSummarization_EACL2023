 After drying your lavender post picking, whip up a little muslin bag. Fill this bag with the lavender and seal either by stitching or with a new, clean ribbon.;
,,,, Shake occasionally to shift the sugar and flavour around.
 The sugar will be ready for use after about one month; taste to see if it is strong enough for your liking. Pour some of the sugar into a separate container for serving with tea or into a cooking storage container (for example, use when making lavender and lemon cookies).
 You can continue to refill the sugar jar as many times as desired, to maintain a constant supply of lavender sugar.
