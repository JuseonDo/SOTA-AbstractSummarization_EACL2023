, Also disconnect the large hose from the top of the radiator.
, Run water through the large hose which was disconnected from the top of the radiator and leads to the engine. Watch the water coming out of the large hose which was disconnected from the bottom of the radiator until it turns clear. Do the same to the radiator by running water through the top and watching it pour out the bottom.
, Add the liquid glass and mix thoroughly.
 Top off the coolant system with hose water. Cap the radiator.
 Wait until the water level drops in the radiator and top it off again with hose water.
 When liquid glass heats up it is activated. When it cools down by contacting air it will harden as when it seeps out of the leaky gasket.
 Wait about 15 minutes and drain the coolant system without burning yourself.
 Install the new thermostat with gasket. Ensure the coolant system is put together properly.
