@summary
warm up the muscles that are going to be stretched.

@summary
lay down on a solid surface such as the floor or a treatment table.

@summary
have your partner take the limb through the full passive range of motion, mobilizing all joints that the targeted muscles cross.

@summary
have your partner take you into a passive stretch, preferably targeting specific muscle groups.

@summary
without moving from the stretched position, isometrically contract the muscle being stretched with about 20% to 50% of your strength for 8 to 15 seconds.

@summary
after 8 to 15 seconds of isometric contraction, relax the muscles and have your partner take the limb slowly through its range of motion a few times.

@summary
repeat the stretch/contract/relax sequence as desired.

 This can be done with brief exercise or massage to the area and is very important. Stretching cold muscles can cause cramps and increase the chances of injury.;
, Your partner will be taking you into the stretches and resisting your strength, so they need to be in a solid stance.
 Keep the limb completely relaxed. This helps warm up the joints and shows your partner how far the limb can move prior to applying the stretch.
 Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
 Your partner should support you so that nothing moves and no other muscles are contracting but those being stretched. For example, if you're stretching the hamstrings of one leg, your partner should have your calf on his/her shoulder. Your knee should not bend, your back should not lift up or turn, and your opposite leg should not move.
 This allows the muscles to relax and recover for the next repetition.
 There should be a noticeable increase in range of motion with each repetition.
