 Rules and regulations differ from state to state, so make sure that you are aware of the ones applicable to you. For instance, there are some states which may not even require a license anymore, depending on the circumstances.;
, Make sure that everything is filled out completely, honestly, and to the best of your ability. When you are done, return the completed documents to the department of child services in your state through mail as well.
 A caseworker will be assigned by the department of child services to help you. The caseworker will run a background check on you, and will make sure that you are fit to become a certified daycare provider. For instance, some states may require you to attend a child CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training, but even if your state does not, it is still a very important and useful skill to have. Aside from this, there are other trainings that your state might require you to take, so make sure to accomplish this first.
 Although taking these courses are not required, they are still highly encouraged, as they provide a good amount of information on the topics that you should be aware of as a daycare provider. There are helpful classes for topics such as activities, meals, rules, and sanitation.
 The time it takes to get licensed differs from state to state, so it would be best to ask your local child services department for the typical processing time in your locality.
