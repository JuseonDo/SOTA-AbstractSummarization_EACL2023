Be sure that the leaves are not too thick. You want to be able to get some light through the leaf.
 Late morning or early evening. That is called the 'Golden Hour' and has the best light for those types of photos.
 You want it to complement your leaf.


Also, make sure that they aren't 'busy'. If there is too much going on in the photo, the leaf won't be seen. It will blend in or be over-powered by the background.
With Autumn leaves, perfection isn't perfect. An imperfection can make the shot much more interesting.
 You will want to be sure that your white balance is correct. It will help greatly with the seasonal colors.
