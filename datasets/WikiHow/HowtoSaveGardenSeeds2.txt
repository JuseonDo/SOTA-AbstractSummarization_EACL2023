 Vegetables that are overripe will be easy to pull off the plant, and the seeds inside will be easy to access. Take the seeds from the vegetables or fruits by scooping them out of the center.;
, This will prevent rot and mold. Let them sit on a dry, warm surface until they are no longer moist to the touch. Or, place them in a ventilated, dry container or box to remove moisture.
