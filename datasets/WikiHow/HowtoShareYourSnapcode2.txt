 To add someone by their snapcode, you simply need to point your camera at their code box and scan it with your phone.
 This is the ghost icon at the top of the camera interface when you first open Snapchat.


For best results, lay your friend's phone on a flat, stable surface when scanning the code.
 This should be in the middle of your friend's phone screen. Doing so will cause your Snapchat app to begin scanning your friend's snapcode., Do this on your phone, not your friend's.
 This will take two to three seconds, depending on your data or wifi connection. You have successfully added a friend by snapcode!
