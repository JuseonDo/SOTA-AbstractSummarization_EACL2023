 This can be done by selecting the Forge from the main menu of the Halo: Complete Multiplayer Experience disc and selecting the Heretic map from the ones available. Gathering the Mythic skulls is infinitely easier when you are in a Forge session rather than Custom game, although this skull can be reached in a custom game with help from a grav lift or grenade jump.;
, Make sure that if you are not host, that the player who is has enabled all players to be able to enter editor mode.
 The Heretic skull is located fairly high on the map, at roughly the same height as the sword.
 There is a Needler next to a fusion coil in the area to help distinguish this side from the back of the map. Because the map is symmetrical, setting a point to guide yourself by helps immensely. However, the map is also fairly small, so shouldn't pose too much of a problem.
 The skull is located to the right of the Energy Sword platform.
 The are located directly above the two lower spawn rooms below, at about the same height as the sword platform. There will be two ledges at the base of the vents; the Heretic skull is resting on the second ledge.
 Pick it up by pressing the Right Bumper when prompted and be careful not to fall off before you claim it. Congratulations, you just found the Heretic Skull!

, It is represented by a skull with the Mark of Shame on its' forehead, a Covenant symbol.
