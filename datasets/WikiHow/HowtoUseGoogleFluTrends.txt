 It's at: http://www.google.org/flutrends/. You will see a large map appear, like the one here:;
, Hover your mouse pointer over different countries to see the level of flu activity estimated according to what people are searching for. You can see that the intensity of flu is shown by a change in colors. The color scale denoting the levels of flu activity is as follows:


Dark red = intense flu activity
Red = high flu activity
Orange = moderate flu activity
Light orange verging on green = low flu activity
Green = minimal flu activity.
 Find the drop-down box in the left hand margin of the page that says "Select Country/Region". Choose your country and wait for the statistics to appear. You should be able to see a graph that will show you the national trends plotted according to the months in the current year. You can also check out previous years by clicking on the "Past Years" tab above the graph.
 These are located under the world map. As well as a link to downloadable flu activity data, other features include:
