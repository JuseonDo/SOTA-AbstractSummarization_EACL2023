 You'll need a file manager that will allow you to open ZIP files. You'll be using this app to extract the map files and then copy them to your Minecraft PE worlds folder.


One of the most popular file managers for this task is ASTRO File Manager, available for free from the Google Play Store. You can also use a file manager like ES File Explorer, also available for free.
 Make sure that the map file is for Minecraft PE, and not the computer version. Also make sure that you're downloading a map that matches your version of Minecraft PE, as it isn't as easy as it is on PC to change the version you are playing.


You can see the version of Minecraft you are using on the Minecraft PE main menu.
 Your File Manager will display all of the folders on your Android device. You can find the Downloads folder in the base directory.
 Tapping the ZIP file will display the contents of the ZIP. You should see a folder with the name of the map you downloaded.
 This will open a menu of actions you can take with the folder.
 This will copy the folder, allowing you to paste it elsewhere.
 You'll find this on your base directory, in the same location that you found the Downloads folder.
 This will contain a folder for each of your saved games.
 This will paste the new map folder into the minecraftWorlds folder.
 Your new map will be listed in your saved games. It usually appears at the bottom, but could show up anywhere in the list.
