 Heat it for 10-15 mins.;
,, Bend them slowly or they will break. One ice-cream stick can make a half of the bracelet so two ice-cream sticks equals to a whole bracelet if you use a mould that is big. If the mould is small then possibly an ice-cream stick can make a bracelet.
 Place them in a cool, dry place or under a fan or AC or in a cool air room or cupboard. This aids in the quick drying of the ice-cream sticks. If you want, just leave them out under the sun or anywhere dry and cool not wet.
 Check whether its hard and not still soft. if it is hard, then move on!

, It looks like a bangle if you are using 2 ice-cream sticks and it would look like a bangle similar to the one using with 2 sticks except with a bit space in the bracelet if you are using a stick.
