 Make sure the noodles are totally covered. You want the noodles to become pliable and clear before taking them out of the water. Wait for 15 minutes. Let them soak while you prepare the rest of the meal.;
, Place it in the freezer for about 15 minutes to make cutting the meat easier. Slice thinly across the grain and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Rinse and wash the cutting board with hot, soapy water.
 Dice half of the onion, and grate approximately 1 cup of carrots. Set these aside while you finish prepping.
 Use this later as a garnish as well as a flavoring.
 Put 3 tbsp of peanut oil in the wok and add the sliced chicken.
 Add the veggies and continue stirring to make sure everything is being cooked evenly. As with all stir-fry, be careful that you don’t over-cook the veggies!

, Make sure you don’t cut too much, making the pieces too small. Only make a few cuts, as necessary. Drain all the water.
, Start with about a cup of broth for good measurement. Don’t add too much broth, or else the noodles won’t be able to absorb it all and the meal will be soupy and the noodles will be gelatinous.
 Do this for 5 minutes.
 Get your peanuts, soy sauce, and lemon out and ready to garnish the dish.
 The peanuts are not necessary although they do add a nice crunch to the meal. Add the soy sauce and lemon, also to your personal taste. Serve and enjoy!
