@summary
if a teacher asks you to bring a book for when you are doing the test, bring a bookmark with notes on it.
@article
 (Some bookmarks have, say.. multiplication 1- 12 on them.)


Make sure to hide the bookmark all the way in the book. If you're done you can throw it away if not needed to get rid of evidence or erase the marks.
