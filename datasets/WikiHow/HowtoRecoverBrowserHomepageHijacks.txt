Go to your browser's settings and set the home pages and search engines as per your requirement and delete all the unwanted things you see there.;
,, But all of them will not go so easily, only some of them you can remove it and some can't.,

You may remember that after installation of which software the problem has started. It may have contained malware or some other viruses so uninstall it.(By using control panel or ccleaner) .


Go to program files and you can see the unwanted files still there delete all of them but it will not happen with some files it says that the file is still running even if you have closed all software. so open the task manager and you can see that files you want to delete there now end them,then you can delete those file but be quick otherwise they will restart immediately, like this delete all files one by one.


Scan your whole system to delete any virus traces of the files.
