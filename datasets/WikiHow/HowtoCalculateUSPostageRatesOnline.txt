Postage prices change periodically, so it's a good idea to double-check postage rates, even if you've mailed a similar-size-and-weight package before.
, Input the destination zip code you're sending to in the "To ZIP Code" field.
, Several sizes are available, with dimensions and corresponding prices listed on the USPS website.


Shipping by flat rate almost always saves you money if you're sending something heavy. But if you're sending something relatively light, it might be worth your while to calculate non-flat-rate postage.
 Although a postal scale would give you the most accurate measurement, you can at least estimate postage using a kitchen scale or even a bathroom scale, if the package is heavy enough to trigger the latter. Input the weight, in pounds and ounces, into the appropriate field at the bottom of the web page.
 If you selected "Large Package" you'll have to input the package's general shape (rectangular/square or non-rectangular) and dimensions, then click "Continue" again.
 You can also print the appropriate postage online and arrange for a postal carrier to pick your package up.
;
, If the package won't fit in any of the flat-rate mailers, select either "Large Envelope," "Package" or "Large Package" from the remaining options.


Click "Continue." If you selected "Large Package" you'll be prompted to enter the package's dimensions and weight, then click "Continue" again.
Select from the variety of pricing options you're presented with.
, In the pull-down menu below the appropriate option, select your preferred mailing service--for example, Priority Mail, First Class or Standard.
 Directly below this, enter the quantity of each type of mail to be sent, then click "Calculate" to calculate your postage cost.
