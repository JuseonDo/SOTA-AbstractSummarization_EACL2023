 Using your fingers, massage your skin in a circular motion, working the jelly into the stain. Continue doing this until the stain begins to come loose from your skin.


The benefit of using petroleum jelly and your fingers is that there’s a decreased chance of irritating your skin with abrasive rubbing!
The drawback is that as the stain comes loose, things get messy. Be careful not to get the dye on anything as it starts coming off of your skin.
 The dye will transfer easily to your fingers, and from your fingers to anything you touch. Using disposable cotton balls will keep the mess in check, but be careful not to irritate your skin when rubbing it.
 You’ll be able to see when the dye starts coming off the skin and mixing with the jelly, but it may be difficult to see if the whole stain is off. If there’s still some dye on your skin when you wipe off the jelly, you have two options:


Reapply another layer and repeat the process as many times as is necessary
Move on to the next step

, Follow the same procedure as the first step, but make the layer thicker than the previous one. This time, though, allow the jelly to sit on your skin for several hours.


Just go about your day at home as though it isn’t there. Do chores, cook dinner, read a book — whatever you want.
 Rub gently in a circular motion as you remove the jelly. Again, wash your face with warm water and a clean washcloth to remove the jelly.
