 This means that if anything goes seriously wrong, you can get it sorted fast. They can also recommend you on better ways to look after your vagina.;
, Although this sort of underwear often isn't very flattering, it allows your skin to 'breathe', keeping you fresher, and getting rid of bacteria.
 This unbalances the pH system and can cause the vagina to become acidic, leaving it unable to clean itself, and open to more bacteria and infections.
 If you find yourself with a new sexual partner, try to discuss each others sexual health beforehand, to make sure you won't pass any infections between each other. If possible, make sure you are both tested for STIs, especially if you don't want to use condoms.
 If more than one person will be using them, it is best to put a condom on all sex toys beforehand.
 Too much sugary and fatty foods can make your vaginal fluids bitter and smell unpleasant - it can help to eat more fruit such as pineapple and strawberries. Other healthy foods to help your vagina maintain its pH are garlic, and natural or Greek yogurt.
, Remember to change your sanitary towel/tampon every four hours, especially if you have a heavy flow, to help you feel comfortable.
 If you shave, be very careful, it may be best to keep a small mirror on hand to check how you're doing.
