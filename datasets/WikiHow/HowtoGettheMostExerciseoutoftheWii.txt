play until you think you have really had enough, or if you're up for a challenge, time yourself for two hours a day while you actually work out, and you will get stronger and, more than likely, lighter.

 The Wii was meant to be played standing up, but you can sometimes get around that and just play sitting. Don't.;
, For example, instead of just doing the minimum when playing Tennis in Wii Sports, play like you're actually swinging the Wii Remote.
 If you are playing a First Person Shooter like Call of Duty 3, run in place whenever you are moving your character. Lean to the side whenever you are going behind cover.
