 Use a suitable kettle, not an electric kettle, or, use a saucepan. (this recipe serves one person).;
, Dutch-processed cocoa is usually used in store-bought cocoa mix because it's usually preferred. You can buy it at your regular store if you prefer it, but you may need to look on the ingredient list to see whether or not it's processed with alkali, which is Dutch-processed. It may or may not be listed on the front.
, Over time the cocoa starts to sink to the bottom of the mug, so re-stir or stir well for better flavor.
 Look at the "tips" near the end of this page for suggestions on a creamier cup of hot cocoa.
 Try adding some marshmallows or some whipped cream (you can drizzle chocolate syrup on the whipped cream or add sprinkles for garnish). Also consider adding a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract or peppermints to add additional flavor.
