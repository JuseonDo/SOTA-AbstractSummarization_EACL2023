 Cut the chocolate into thin slices or small pieces and then add the heated fresh cream to it and whisk it well. You can use a double boiler method to melt the chocolate too. Save some amount of chocolate for covering the cake to give it a perfect finish.;
, Add this melted chocolate to broken biscuit pieces. Mix both well (the biscuits must be broken into very small pieces or medium pieces but it must not be powdered].
 Add this mixture into the shaped vessel and refrigerate it for an hour or two until it takes shape and forms like a cake.
 Then take the chocolate which had been saved for applying over the cake and apply it over the cake in order to make it look neat and beautiful.
