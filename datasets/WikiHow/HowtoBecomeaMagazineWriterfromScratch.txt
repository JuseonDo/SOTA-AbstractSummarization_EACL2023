 If you don't have these traits naturally, take a short course or even a degree and develop them.;
, Get old copies of magazines of all different styles from secondhand stores and read through the different writing styles. Make notes on style techniques, quirks and interesting angles.

,, You can gather this information from the masthead or in some instances, through researching online.
 Most editors are going to want to see clips or sample pieces. Since you are starting from scratch, you will need to create up to three brilliant articles that you don't intend ever having published. These will serve simply as a reference of what you are capable of.
 Using the information you've gathered from mastheads, mail or email editors with your details. Be sure to address them directly by name to show that you are familiar with their publication. Politely ask them for "Submission Guidelines" and include the sample work you concocted earlier. Make sure you spell well and use perfect grammar.

 The pieces you publish will begin your clip book that will help you acquire paid assignments in the future. For new writers, published clips are like gold, so don't ever be bitter about working for free (in the beginning).
