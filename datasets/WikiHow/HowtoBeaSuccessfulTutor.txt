@summary
introduce yourself to both the parent and student.

@summary
find out what kind of learner the child is (visual, auditory, kinesthetic or a combination of these) and teach according to how they learn (e.g: visual learners like diagrams and charts, auditory learners benefit from discussion and word games, and kinesthetic ones need movement and hands on experiences to remember ideas and concepts).

@summary
start by checking what level the child is at with their writing by giving them a few activities (e.g: for english - a description of the last dream they had, a list of pro/cons about having school uniforms, or an essay structure for an analysis of three major themes in a novel).

@summary
when the child brings you a school assignment, go through the criteria sheet with a highlighter.

@summary
don't do the assignment for them!,

@summary
make sure that the parent and student are both aware that the grades they receive at school might not always indicate how much they have progressed.

@summary
you'll often find yourself putting in the extra hours for students.

 Make sure you are confident and welcoming, making both people feel comfortable with your services. It is important to communicate expectations and goals at the very beginning of your job, so that everyone's voice is being heard. Allow the child and parent to have a discussion with you about the areas in which the child experiences struggles or successes. For example, they may have a fantastic vocabulary, but have difficulty with sentence structure.;
,,, This way, both you and your student know exactly what the teacher is looking for.
 I know this sounds pretty obvious, but some students can often become dependent on their tutor or parent to do their work for them out of fear of making mistakes. Make sure you are gradually doing less and less work for the child. Tutoring/teaching is all about allowing the student to become a life-long learner who can sustain their own independent learning practice.
 If the student started working with you when they were receiving mainly low grades, it is unfair to expect instantly high grades after only a few tutoring sessions. This being said, always make sure your student receives praise for the progress they are making, and allow them to reflect on their own learning practice.
 That comes with the profession. So, if you want to get paid for everything you do, you should probably find yourself an office job in a big soul-destroying company. Teaching/tutoring is about providing help wherever and whenever it is needed; even if you don't always get some sort of financial reward. It's a good idea to share a professional email with your student for editing and feedback purposes. This could even be the parent's email address.
