 Warm it over low heat. When lukewarm, transfer it to a bowl.;
, Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and stir well to combine. Set aside for a quarter of an hour. This will be sufficient time for the yeast to dissolve.
 Add the salt and baking powder and stir through.
 Mix to form a dough.
 When it is smooth and well formed, shape it into a ball. Cover and place aside in a warm place. Allow to rise for an hour.
 Prepare a baking sheet by lining with parchment paper or a silicone sheet. (You could grease it instead, if preferred.)

, Then divide it into nine even pieces and roll each piece into a ball.
 Using a rolling pin, roll the ball out flat. Repeat for all the other balls.
 Place straight into the center of the oven, as many as sensibly fit. (Do the baking in rounds.)

, The naans are ready when they are slightly browned. Wrap baked naans in a fresh tea towel while baking the remaining ones.
 Naan goes well with dhal, curries and seasoned vegetable dishes.
