 Fill a small saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a heat-safe bowl on top. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the surface of the water., This will not only blend them together, but also help them melt faster.

If you want a more firm lip balm, use more beeswax and less coconut oil.
If you want a softer lip balm, use less beeswax and more coconut oil.
 Pierce each capsule with a pin or needle, then squeeze the oil into the beeswax mixture.If you can't find any vitamin E oil capsules, you can use the kind that comes in a bottle. You will need ¼ teaspoon of vitamin E oil total.
 The honey will make the lip balm extra-moisturizing, while the cinnamon will make it plumping., If you can't find any empty lip balm containers, you can buy small, empty jars meant for storing beads or excess paint from the arts and crafts store. You can also use a clean contact lens case.

Work quickly; the mixture will start to harden in 5 to 10 minutes.
 It will take about 5 to 10 minutes for the lip balm to start to harden. It may take 15 to 20 minutes for it to finish hardening. If it is taking too long for the lip balm to harden, stick it into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes.
