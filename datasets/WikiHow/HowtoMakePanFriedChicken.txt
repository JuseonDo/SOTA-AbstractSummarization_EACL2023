 In addition to that, get out some Pam Cooking Spray.






;
, Be sure that the stove is on medium-high. If you are using a gas stove, spray the Pam with the flames off to avoid possible flareups.
 You should wash your hands before and after handling the chicken. You could also season one or both sides of the chicken.
 Be sure not to splatter any oil that's in the pan.










You should continue to nudge the chicken so it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. You may want to lift up the breast every once in a while to spray the pan again.
 You should cook this side the same as the first.










For this, you can push down to cook the side faster. This method isn't suggested for cooking the rest of the breast.
 Make sure you put the heat down to medium.









By doing this, you will cook the inside of the breast without burning the outside.










If the middle is white or grayish, proceed to the next step.
If the middle is still the slightest shade of pink, continue cooking the chicken as mentioned in the above step.
