 Think these questions: "What books do they not have and what books do I have? How much are library cards? How do they organize their books? What special things do they do?";
, A garage should do. If not, rent a small space from a person.
 Maybe the kids' section on the left, etc.
 Have a small table for kids with homework, and a small space for crafts. Have calm colors like pink, purple, and blue. No yellows, reds, or oranges.
 Enough said.
 Like the dewy dudes way.
