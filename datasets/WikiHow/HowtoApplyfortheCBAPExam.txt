 You want to understand the qualification for sitting for the certification. This handbook provides a thorough explanation on the experiences needed to qualify, the educational requirements... etc;
, This is the most challenging task as it requires that you look back 10 years and recall information about each of the projects you've worked on. You will need to remember the project name, description, hours worked on each projects, hours spend on business analysis tasks on each projects... etc

, A great technique for doing so is to first (1) understand the deliverables produced in each task and (2) matching them against those you've produced. This will allow you to determine if your past experience is inline with what the BABOK® defines as business analysis experience.
 This is the number of courses that you spent working on all project activities regardless of whether they were business analysis tasks or not.
 In order to be eligible to sit for the CBAP, you will need a total of 7500 hours of business analysis experience. Meaning in any given project, if you've worked 1000 hours total, and only 25% of this time was allocated to business analysis activities, then you can only use 250 hours to apply toward your eligibility.
 Sum up all the hours from each projects to determine if your past experience provides you with the 7500 hours needed to qualify for the CBAP®.
 The business analysis tasks you want to allocate time to are those that align with the BABOK®.
 Another qualifying factor to sit for the CBAP is the number of hours spend on knowledge areas. IIBA requires that you have experience in 4 out of the 6 knowledge area and that you spend at least 900 hours performing the tasks of those knowledge areas.
, Wait about three weeks to receive a response on whether you have been approved or not.
