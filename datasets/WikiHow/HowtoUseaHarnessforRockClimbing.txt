@summary

 At the front of the harness will be where there is a loop connecting the waist to the legs.  This is called the belay loop.;
,  Make sure you also stepped through the waist belt.
,  Newer harnesses automatically double back but many older versions need to be manually double backed.  Make sure this is done properly or else your harness may come undone while climbing.
  If it stays on, you're good to go.
  Leg loops should be left slightly loose so that you can still move your legs.  A good rule is to be able to fit two fingers together between the leg strap and your leg.
