@summary
prepare the corn for canning.

@summary
slice the corn from the cob using a sharp knife starting from one end of the cob and slicing down.

@summary
add the corn to 5 cups (1.2 l) boiling water for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

@summary
clean 9 glass pint (500ml) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water.

@summary
pour the corn with cooking liquid into the clean jars leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top of the jars.

@summary
wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, stir gently with a clean, wooden spoon to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids.

@summary
place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling.

@summary
process jars in the pressure canner for 55 minutes, adjusting the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below).start timing when the necessary pressure is reached.

@summary
turn off heat and allow pressure to return to 0 psi (0 kpa), then remove the weights or open the vent and wait for 2 minutes.

@summary
remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.

@summary
label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

 Select ripe, fresh corn with bright green husks and plump kernels.Peel and remove husk and silk from the ears of corn. Wash and scrub the ears of corn with a vegetable brush under cool running water.
 Catch the kernels in a large bowl or on a baking sheet.


Avoid slicing into the cob, cutting only about 3/4 of the way through the kernels.
Set the bottom end of the cob on a small, overturned bowl to make slicing and collecting the kernels easier.
 Avoid cooking the corn for too long to avoid mushy kernels.
 Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.
 Add one tsp. (5 mL) of canning salt to each jar (optional). , Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.
 Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.
 Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4,001 to 6,000 feet (1,000 to 2,000 m) (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).
For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m).
 Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.
 Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 hours.
