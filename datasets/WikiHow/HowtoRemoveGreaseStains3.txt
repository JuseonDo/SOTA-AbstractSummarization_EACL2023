The method being described is good for carpeting, wool, acetate, silk, and rayon., Cornmeal, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, talcum powder, and salt all are super-absorbers.Let it set until the process seems to have halted. With a stiff bristled brush, brush the stain out of the fabric.
 You know, the kind that these fabrics can tolerate -- the kind at your dry cleaners. Spot lifters work, too.









Work outward from the center using light strokes. A damp pad or cloth will be best.
 If you don't have a dry spotter, one can be made with a bit of coconut oil and dry-cleaning solvent.Dampen a pad with dry spotter and place it on top of the stain. Remove the pad as soon as it is saturated.
 Let dry. Voila! Stain gone. Finito!
