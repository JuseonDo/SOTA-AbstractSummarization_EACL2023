when you get the halter on without any trouble, reward him with a treat.

it will probably take two weeks to a month or so for this to work, depending on how head shy your horse is.
@article
 The horse can sense your frustration and/or fear and will respond to it.;
, While your horse's head is in the food, slowly pull the halter on to the horse's face. If it doesn't work the first time, try again patiently.
 This helps him to sense that there is nothing to be afraid of.
, He will associate the treat with behaving when putting on the halter.
 If he has been abused, it will probably take a little longer, so be prepared to persevere and show your horse that you can be trusted.
