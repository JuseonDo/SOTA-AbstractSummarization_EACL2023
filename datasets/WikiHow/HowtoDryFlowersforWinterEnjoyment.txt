 You will want to pick perfect specimens as they will stand up to the drying process the best. Use a sharp pair of scissors and cut a long stem.;
, Once you have cut the flowers you want to dry bundle them together with a rubber band. Hang them upside down in a place away from sunlight with a good circulation of dry air. They should be dry in three weeks. Herbs can be dried this way as well.
 It works very well however it is a little more time consuming and requires a little more work. Silica sand is very fine sand and you can find it in craft stores. A much less expensive choice is builder’s sand that you can buy at hardware stores, however it usually comes in large quantities and to dry a few flowers may not be the best choice.
 Add your flowers, strong flowers can just be laid flat on the sand, flat blooms like sunflowers should have their stems cut short and laid face up.
 Continue to do this until the flowers are completely covered. It generally takes about four weeks for the flowers to dry.
 It works best to use a small artists brush for this process.
