 Use the Interstate (I-4), if you need to, since I-4 has exits for each of the four theme parks.


Another common street that can get you there, or that most users know to use is W Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway which will lead you to an intersection with World Drive that will lead you to all four parks (in FL).
Users of the California parks should follow signs for the Disneyland park from I-5 in Anaheim, CA.
Those traveling to the parks in other continents outside of the US, should follow the directions according to the cities or hotel employees directions or that of their locals.;
,,,,, They'll try to get you into the spot as smoothly as possible. Once you see the first guy, look around for the second attendant, until you see the last attendant ask you to stop pulling forward.,, The sign will tell you which part of the parking lot you are parked in. Each theme park's lots are themed into something different. One theme park lots are themed into Disney characters(Magic Kingdom), another is into things having to do with movies(Disney Studios), the third has something yet to do with the world(Epcot).


Write this information down on your slip of paper for your own information. With over 10,000 cars in any given day, this paper will be an invaluable piece of information when your feet are tired and/or there's no one else nearby to help you find your particular car.






Try to memorize and/or write down your license plate to the car you've driven if you have rented the car. Also, write down the make, model and color of the car, which can also be helpful in some times.
 You'll see a stream full of people walking in the same direction.
