first you have to know what are the ingredients that build a strong password, one that is very difficult to guess: a mix of small and capital letters; some numbers and one or two special characters.

let's practice: let's say you are a red sox fan, so you can strip the vowels and mix small and capitals: rdsx.

good!,

obviously you would use grdsx77&o for google, and so on...

@article
 When you have the right mix, you are done with the first part.;
, Now you add a 2 digit number that means something to you and a special character. Let's say it became RdSx77&.
 Now let's deal with the problem of having one different password for each service. You can add, let's say, the first 2 letters of the service you are using, the first in the beginning of the password, and the second in the end. If you want to log in Yahoo, you would use the y in the beginning and the a in the end, so the final password would be yRdSx77&a, which is very hard to guess.
