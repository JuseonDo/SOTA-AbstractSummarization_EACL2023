@summary
get out the things you'll need.cut 3 centimeter (1.2 in) lengths from the pipe and make a mark 2/3 from one of the sides (1cm)

@summary
,put the screw in from the side farthest from the mark to a little behind where the mark is, and hammer on it from both sides till you can't get it out by and (you have too unscrew it, but later)

@summary
,hammer the sides diagonally and fold them to make a point form (it doesn't matter if it's perfect, you'll get it into better shape later)

@summary
,

@summary
cut the sides on the bottom of the point and fold them over the sides.

@summary
assemble the arrow.

@summary
glue on your arrowheads and paint the shafts if you're going to.

@summary
cut the feathers/bike tire in more or less this shape (10-12cm across and 2 cm in the highest point), and make a mark along the arrows circumference 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the back of the arrow.

@summary
with your pencil sharpener, sharpen the end of the arrow (the will-be nock) until it is about half the diameter as the rest of the shaft.

,,,, If you want to, use the grinder to polish, sharpen, and point the arrowheads

, You'll need normal, wood shafts (they don' have to be any wood in particular.
 After you've glued on the points, cut the arrow to the right length. It can be done holding the arrow to you're anchor point and placing it on your extended arm – as if in shooting position - and adding the index fingers length) (by hammering and cutting in various ways you can't get different arrowhead forms – the middle one is a fishing arrow, and the right one is a poorly made hunting arrow)

, The backs of your fletches will touch this point. Make three marks in equal distance (this distance will be the same as the diameter of the shaft – in my case, 8mm) one from the other and glue the fletches as straight as you can. If you can, make one of the fletches (the guide one) parallel with the arrowhead.
 Heat your knife (it will turn black and you probably won't want to use it again for eating) and cut (with heat – if you saw the nock it will break quite quickly) about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) into the shaft (lengthwise). This cut has to be perpendicular to the guide fletch, and preferably to the point. Then heat the nail and at the end of the nock (where the string will be when it's nocked) pass it through widthwise, parallel to the cut you just made. You can also tie a bit of string bellow the nock to make it last longer.
