 If you're not allowed to stand on your board in the house try in the grass. While holding onto something get used to how the board feels and everything.
, Skating with your left foot in front is called regular. Skating with your right foot in front is called goofy. Try standing both feet together and stepping forward. Which ever foot you step forward with is most likely your lead foot. Try riding with this foot forward; however, feel free to switch until you are comfortable., Some driveways are slanted slightly, leading to grass. This is a great way to practice., Leaning to a side can turn the board, but you can also apply slight pressure against the tail, or the back concave part of the board. The board's front wheels will lift off, this is called a manual. Don't stay in that position to long. Once the wheels are off, immediately turn your legs to the left or right to turn.,,,
