 Line the ingredients in the order that you want to serve them with their own spoons, and provide small disposable spoons for the guests who want to try the more exotic ingredients first. There is no specific method to this. Purists like arranging the ingredients according to color, but it doesn't matter. It all ends up mixed anyway.

, It's best to put the sweeter ingredients in the middle, but there's really no science to it. Try to put as much variety as you can until the glass is half full (or half empty). Add sugar if you like.
 You might have to pack it in with your clean hands.
, Sprinkle with a handful of the pounded rice or Rice Krispies.
 You will need it to avoid spillage.
 Dainty hands will not work. This is a messy dish that you have to work for. Enjoy the sound of crunching ice. Eat and then mix some more. You can even mix while you chew!
