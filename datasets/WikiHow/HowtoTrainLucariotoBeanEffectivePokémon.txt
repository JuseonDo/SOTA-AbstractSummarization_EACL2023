 It may take a while, but Rare Candies might help.;
, Put the Exp. share on it. This will help a lot while training.
 Lucario learns Aura Sphere at Level 37 in Gen 4 and Level 42 in Gen 5 and is its main move.
 Dark Pulse, Dragon Pulse, Close Combat are all excellent moves that Lucario can make use of.
