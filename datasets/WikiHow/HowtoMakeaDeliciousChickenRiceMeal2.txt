 You'll be using this in about 10 minutes; for now, leave it alone to boil.
 When they're done (it should take 7-8 minutes, depending on the size), set them aside on a separate plate. You'll need them in a bit.


The chicken doesn't have to be entirely cooked through; it'll cook a bit more when it's simmering alongside the rice. You just want to give it a hand to speed up the process as a whole.
 Add a bit more olive oil if need be and turn on medium-high. Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring regularly, until the onions turn translucent.
 They should glisten in the coating of the olive oil when everything is thoroughly combined. Sprinkle with a pinch of saffron if desired and give 'er a stir once more.
 Add a bit more salt and pepper (if you'd like, of course), and then pour in the boiling water. Turn the heat down to medium-low and cover to simmer.
 When this time is up, you're ready! Garnish as desired and serve.


If dinner as a whole isn't ready, keep the skillet over a very low flame to stay warm. It should be okay for another 20-30 minutes.
For leftovers, keep them in a resealable container in the fridge. They'll keep for a couple of days.
