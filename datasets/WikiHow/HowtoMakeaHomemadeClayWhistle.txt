,, Make sure you don't into the neck. Make the hole big and hollow! The clay has to be pretty thin to make it nice and hollow. If you want your whistle to be lower, make the cavity bigger, if you want it to be higher, make the cavity smaller!

, Keep pinching until it's closed, make sure there aren't any cracks. It has to be very smooth. Use the slip to smooth out cracks and to help close the back.
 On the flat side, pierce a hole right below the neck, but it must go into the cavity though. If you mess up and don't hit the cavity, press diagonally into the cavity. Clear the opening of the whole and make sure there isn't any excess clay in the cavity and the opening.
 Be sure to clear off the tool so there isn't any clay in the blow hole. Test out the whistle-if it works proceed, if it doesn't now it won't when it is done. So if it doesn't work adjust the neck a little bit, squeeze around, and make 100% sure there is no extra clay in any of the holes or the cavity. Make the neck a little bit bigger if necessary. Play around with it and try it out after every change. If you get a good sound do not try to perfect it! Stick with it or you could mess it up big time.
, Just a typical paint is of, glaze if you have it, but whatever you use, paint on several layers. Decorate it any way you want! Animals, foods, or just a cool design is cool!

, Show it off!
