, Cook the bacon with 1/4 cup of butter on the skillet until it's just a bit under crispy. When it's done, remove it from the skillet, drain it while keeping 4 tablespoon (59.1Â ml). of the bacon grease, and set it aside.
 Place 4 tbsp. of flour and the 4 tbsp. of grease in the skillet and stir the ingredients together for at least a minute, until they are thoroughly combined. Make sure not to burn the flour; if it has started to burn a little early, it's time to add the milk.
 Add 2 1/2 cups of milk to the mixture and continue to stir the ingredients together.
 This will add extra delicious flavor to the country bacon gravy. Stir the ingredients to combine.
 Then, let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes, until the sauce thickens.
 Stir it in to the mixture a little bit. Let the mixture simmer until it reaches the consistency you want.
 Add salt and pepper to the gravy to taste.
 Serve this creamy country bacon gravy over crispy biscuits.
