the boss fight is fluffy's fjord.

 The Thunder eggs are now green. The levels will be hardest here.
 It's powerful, and it's power is to freeze enemies. It can create stones Ty can step in water, also.
 You have to take down the burning logs with your new Frostyrang, to see if the boomerang works.
 To defeat this one, hit Fluffy five times with your Flamerang (the fire one), then the rest, hit with the Frostyrang (the cold one).
