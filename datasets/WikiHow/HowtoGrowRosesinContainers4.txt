 The chips or stones should be larger than any holes in the bottom of the pot to prevent them from falling through. This layer provides your roses with additional drainage.
 Loosely pack the soil into the pot. Do not pack too tightly, as your rose needs room to breathe.
 Roses need a lot of nutrients, and bonemeal can provide the fertile conditions your roses need to produce many blooms.
 If working with a bare-root rose, spread the roots out comfortably. Rose roots need ample room to spread out horizontally.
 Gently press the soil around the stems. The surface of the soil should match the place where the roots and rose plant meet.


The container should be filled so that the soil almost comes to the top. If the rose is too deep in the container, pull it out of the soil and add more to the bottom of the pot.
 Even though root rot does pose a threat to roses, these flowers also need plenty of moist soil to survive.
 Choose a wooden or metal stake proportional to the predicted size of the plant when it matures. Plant the stake deep into the pot, allowing it to touch the bottom.
 Old nylons, green garden tape, and polyfoam coated wire all work well.
