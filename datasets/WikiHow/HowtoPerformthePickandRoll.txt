 For the pick and roll to work properly, the offense must be spreading the floor and the lane must be open. Since the center is usually occupying the lane, he is the best person to set the pick. Approach the defender quickly, get right up against him, set yourself and brace yourself for the impact.;
, Drive hard and fast laterally and brush up against your teammate so that there is no way the defender can go over the pick. His only choice is to go under the pick (leaving you open) or switch (giving the big man an open lane).
, Pivot towards the basket leaving the switched defender in the dust. Both players need to be quick and remain more or less parallel with at least ten feet of space between them.
 Since the guard has a mismatch in size, a bounce pass will work best.
 It should be easy since there is no one guarding him.
 This play is not only a crowd-pleaser, but is also very intimidating.
