 Obtain the species when they're in bloom. That way, you'll know up front what you like the shape or colour of.;
, This will help to avoid random pollination.
 Always keep note of which brush has been applied to which plant - mixta to rajaÂ and raja to mixta. It might help to stick a label on each brush, or colored dots, etc., to avoid accidental mix-ups.
, Carefully pinch off the seed heads and remove the seeds. Store the seeds in a paper bag kept a cool dark place.
