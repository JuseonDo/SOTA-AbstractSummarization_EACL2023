 Most satin and grosgrain ribbons sold at craft stores are synthetic. Burlap and cotton ribbons canâ€™t be heat-sealed.
 Throw the ribbon in the water if it catches fire. Open a window.
, Your fingers should be as far away as possible, while allowing the ribbon to be stiff on its side.
 In most cases it does not need to be inside the edge of the flame to burn the edge. Move quickly and steadily across the edge.
 Swipe your finger along the edge after 30 seconds. It should feel hard where it has sealed.Repeat the process again, moving the ribbon closer to the flame if the edge does not feel different.
