 Here are some things to think about: Is it too small for you or too big? If it's too small, that's okay, because you are going to separate the two halves. Make sure it has a pattern that you like.;
, Make sure your are comfortable with the size.
 Now, hem the edge that you just cut, so that it will not fray. You can hem it about a centimeter from the edge, or you can hem it above that if you are proud of your stomach.
 Hem it. You may hem it according to your preferences, such as if you want it low rise, you can do that.
 Now go hit the beach!
