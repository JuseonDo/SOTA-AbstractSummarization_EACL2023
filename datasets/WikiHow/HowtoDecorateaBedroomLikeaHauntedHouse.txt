 Add some paint of red and some marks of spirits and ghosts. To go even further, write a message in blood like " THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED ENEMIES OF THE HEIR BEWARE!". However, do not use that, it is from a book ( Harry Potter). Create your own, and write it down. Include some footprints in shiny ink!;
, Remove a part of it, and leave it somewhere on the floor. Add fake flesh and some blood. To be extra creative, how about adding some, say, tooth marks. Put a part of it on objects, too, so they look haunted. If anybody asks, say that it is just the blood of ________ (insert name that sounds creepy) mixed with _______ (another creepy name's) physical remains. Make sure it all gives a realistic look. Add some animal bones or "muscles" to be creative.
 Put things about stealing souls and killing. You do not have to do them, you just have to leave a list on a wall in creepy black.
 Scare people. For example, old leather sofas and black dark rugs.Own some scary lights, and artificial blue lights: Put fake or real blood on them. Write names and when they died and where they are living as ghosts now! Make very scary lights, as well.
 Make them white and shiny, but reckless.Add some bits of mold and flesh, and some tooth marks. Make it look like a wolf has been attacking your house.
 You might want to add some brilliant yet scary pictures. Make them look creepy, especially ghost like. Put them in frames and write "My Family" in old fashioned blood. This will make them creeped out. very Much in most cases!

, Write "Current Visitors" on the top.
,, These will appear to be mystery glows.
