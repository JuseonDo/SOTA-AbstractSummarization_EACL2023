 You can need some items for display. There are some posters or stickers which cannot be removed from your home. Tag these "Not for sale" items with a big red sticker.;
,, Place a throw pillow on the couch or a blanket on the back of the couch, books on a shelf or display dishes on a kitchen table. Creating a look of a 'boutique' style atmosphere is much more appealing and people will buy more, especially with yard sale prices.
 Set clear rules for those contributing if there is to be a clearance time at the end of the sale of when that will occur and for how much.


Items not to participate in end of sale clearance should be removed prior or marked clearly that the item is not to participate in clearance.
 The 'must haves' are plenty of plastic bags and plenty of change including coins. Often people will give a twenty dollar bill for a twenty five cent item.


Once the customer has change in their pocket they are much more likely to spend that change than when they only have big bills.
 It may be reconciled at the end of the sale with the cash on hand. This makes for good accounting. Always keep a calculator handy for quick math so not to keep the customer waiting.
 An Email Sign Up Sheet or notebook left out for future sale notifications will bring more customers back the next time you have a sale.
 Baked goods and crafts are wonderful eye pleasers and usually go over well anywhere. If you don't bake or do crafts recruit others who do. You may work out a percentage deal on all their sales for extra income.
 This helps to cut down on theft as well as help the customers., This will keep them from leaving earlier than planned when nature calls expectantly.
 This can keep a customer shopping longer.
 Place large signs at the end of your street and neighborhood entry with balloons emphasizing the word "INDOOR" yard sale. People will come out of curiosity over the word "INDOOR".
