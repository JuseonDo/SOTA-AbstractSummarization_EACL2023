 There may be additional cracks that require your attention.;
, Bridge kits have suction cups at each end of the bridge that latch onto the window and are the best option for hairline cracks on vertical car windows. These kits are available at various auto supply, hardware, or retail stores.
 A metal probe works best for the cleaning process.
 Gently tap the metal probe so that the inner plastic layer of the glass is not damaged. This prevents further widening or spreading of the crack.
, Secure the suction cups in place. Add resin into the crack using the injector or use the pressure and vacuum controls of the injector to suck air out of the crack while forcing the resin in. When the crack has been filled with resin, remove the bridge from the window.
 Windshield repair kit resin does not air-dry; it requires UV light from the sun or an artificial UV lamp to adequately dry.
 Use a cellophane patch, and cover the area that you just applied resurfacing resin to. Expose to direct sunlight or UV lamp, and allow the area to dry. After it is dry, remove the cellophane patch and gently scrape off the excess resurfacing resin with a razor blade to make it level with the surrounding glass to complete the car window hairline crack repair.
