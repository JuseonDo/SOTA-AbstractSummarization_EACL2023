 Take your stick (it should be a long one) and prod (not too hard!) them from behind the spider you are trying to capture. It should move into the canister and you've got yourself a trapdoor spider. Trapdoor spiders will usually hold their doors closed with their fangs. If you can't gently pry the door open, the spider is just behind the door. A quick stab with a small trowel will usually result in a spider still holding its door (or half a spider).
,,, This will cause the web to pull away from the dirt sides.
 The web will eventually pull all of the way out with the spider contained in the small bulb formed at the end of its web.
