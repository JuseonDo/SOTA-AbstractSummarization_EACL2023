@summary
buy a fresh new can of clear polyester casting resin.

@summary
check the viscosity of the resin fluid.set up in an open air area with plenty of ventilation and away from open flames.

@summary
use safety googles, gloves, respirator and coveralls when casting with resins and chemicals.protect all exposed working surfaces with plastic or drop cloth from spills.

@summary
replace or clean airbrush nozzles immediately after use.

@summary
mix small amounts of resin and catalyst at a time.

@summary
read and understand the instructions before mixing and using resin.use less catalyst than the recommended ratio on the chart because the foliage and petal tips could easily burn or get damaged.

@summary
spray as lightly and gentle as you could.

@summary
coat one thin coat at a time to reduce heat shock and faster curing time.wait at least one hour between coats.allow proper ventilation and space between each leaf and flower.use a hair dryer in a low setting to help resin cure faster and dry excess resin.wait at least 48 hours to move and handle your flowers to avoid leaving prints or deforming your flowers.

 A container that has previously been opened may be difficult to open if the cap/lid is sealed tight with resin exposed to air.

Find out the date the can was bottled because resin has a short shelf life; even in sealed, airtight containers, it can become too viscous to effectively coat foliage and flowers.;
, It is important to find resin fluid that can be sprayed or air brushed through the nozzle or sprayer bottle directly to the foliage and flowers.

If the resin is too viscous to be sprayed onto the flower you can carefully sprinkle and pour small drops at a time (This will be further explained below).
,

Avoid breathing resin fumes. Resin has an extremely potent smell and just a small amount poured can fill a house with the smell for hours.
, Resin can cure and set quickly jamming and plugging your sprayer permanently if you don't disassemble and clean right away., The container bottle should have an information chart with the proper resin/catalyst ratio depending of the size and thickness of the cast., Pay close attention to safety tips and warnings.

Use caution while mixing and pouring solutions. When resin makes contact with the catalyst there is a chemical reaction which creates significant heat.
, The thinner and closer the petals and leaves are to each other will be more difficult to cast.

Some leaves and flowers are more difficult to cast because they are more delicate and could stick and clog-up to other leaves and petals.
Excessive heat and heavy resin layers could cause flowers to to curl, discolor and wrinkle.


It is difficult to spray with resin, you can dip thicker and less dense foliage and hang them dry with good results.
