 Meditation helps calm you down.
 This is the voice that's saying all those negative things; throw it away and listen to yourself for once! Not your body!

, Don't let them get to you.
 If you're a guy and you want to dress in girl clothing, go for it! And vice versa, you shouldn't care.

, It can help you keep calm.
 Let it out.
