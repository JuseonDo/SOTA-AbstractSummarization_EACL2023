Unplugging before the thunderstorm is ideal, but it may be the case that you are not near your computer when the storm is coming. Fear not, there are other preventative measures.;
, This is not to be confused with a power strip. A surge protector will look like a bulky power strip. When your home receives a power spike, the surge protector takes this spike and pushes it away from the outlets and your computer.


Remember that even the best surge protectors will not protect against a direct lightning strike.For ultimate protection, if you happen to be home, unplug the surge protector in the case of a threatening storm.
 Look for the following features:


If you regularly connect your computer to the internet, ensure the surge protector has a internet cable surge protector.
Look for a surge protector that offers insurance to cover the loss of properly attached equipment.
 Whereas surge protectors protect surges of power, these UPS devices protect against outages. Outages and dips in power, even if minor, can cause hard or soft damage (like data loss) to certain equipment - for example, external hard drives or advanced telecommunication equipment.


A UPS will be particularly beneficial if you have a home office or continually run operations on your electronics.
Most UPS devices will also protect your devices from power surges.
 Do it well before days with a threat of lightning make it a risky thing to be doing.
, Even if your computer appears to be working you should still give it a check over in case a strike has left it in a dangerous state that might result in electric shock or fire.


If any of your telephones or other electronics show signs of damage, it's wise to assume that your computer took a hit too.



Use your sense of smell. If your computer smells acrid, there may be invisible damage.
 You may be able to recover your data.
