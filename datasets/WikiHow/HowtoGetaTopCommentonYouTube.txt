check the comments.

@summary
if the likes outnumber the dislikes a lot, take it to your advantage and comment in something relative.

@summary
talk about a background scene in the video that few (if any) people noticed.
@article
 The video has to be popular enough that it has at least a few hundred thousand views, but not popular enough that your comment can be shunted down in only a few minutes.;
,, Any joke mentioned in the comments won't do; you must have an original sense of humor.
 For example, if the video has a hundred thousand likes but only a few hundred dislikes, and the video is a funny one about, say, monkeys, type in "476 people are monkeys" or "Some primates disliked this".
 For example, type in "Did anyone see that old monkey get slapped in the face in the bottom right corner at 3:12?"
