 Think cute cropped-tops and shorts. Make sure that your clothes are always tasteful, though.;
, For example, a flowy maxi skirt with a soft top and a belt.
 Greens, purples, and almost EVERY shade of blue!

, If it doesn't work with your shape, Ariel still wears gowns that cinch in at the waist for a flattering figure.
 Shell jewelry is fantastic. Also, sailor knots on a top or a rope belt can suggest the ocean as well.
 This can be achieved with long, layered hair washed and towel-dried. Apply a wave-enhancing creme and let dry. Hair should be worn full and down, as if you had gotten back from the beach.
 Take good care of your toenails and feet, just as Ariel would- they're too precious to mistreat!

, Wear concealer, top eyeliner, mascara, white eyeliner on your waterline and natural red lip color at most. In the nighttime, feel free to experiment with different looks and colors!
