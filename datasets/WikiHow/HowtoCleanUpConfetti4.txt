@summary
get a roll of scotch tape and cut yourself a 6 to 8 inch (15.2 to 20.3Â cm) piece.

@summary
place two or more fingers inside the loop and use the sticky side face down to pick up the confetti.
@article
 Join the sticky side of one end of the piece to the non-sticky side of the other end, making a smooth loop.
 Rotate the tape frequently so you always have a sticky portion to work with. When the tape won pick up anymore, throw it the trash and get a new one.
