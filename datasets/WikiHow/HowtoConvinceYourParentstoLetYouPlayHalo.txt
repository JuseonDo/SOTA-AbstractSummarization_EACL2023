 The game is like a puzzle, and the player must learn how the parts of the puzzle work together to find a solution.;
, Let them watch you play it, and when they see that there really isn't that much gore in it, and there is in fact literally no bad language, they might just let you play it.
 Body structure - you could gain knowledge about this from the fact that Master Chief is biologically enhanced.
 Getting angry will never convince anyone of anything. If your parents start to shout, just stay calm - don't storm off.
 Rushing out a stream of words won't get you anywhere, you need to think it through, decide why you think you should be allowed to play your game, and present your argument nicely.
 Don't lose ground. Think up a retort to every possible response of theirs before hand. That may seem like too much effort, but this is Halo we're talking about!

, Oh and by the way, it won't. If you don't do homework, and lose grades in school, they'll have every right to take it away.
 If you can get one of your parents interested in it, who knows, one day they may play it with you!

, They may or may not let you play it, that's your parents choice.
