playing word games is a good way to help the child to memorize the vocabulary.

@summary

 The very first thing in teaching a child how to learn something is lowering yourself down to the child's age. In short, your understanding mentality should be of that age of the child. Children's brains are fairly different to adult brains - not just in size but also in processing. So when teaching a child, take it slow. It is tempting to just jump right in and try to teach them big phrases and ask them to recite them back to you. This is called mimicking. All the child is really doing just repeating what you have said without knowing what it means.;
, A good thing to do is buy little toy animals or show pictures of animals to help teach the child what they are called.
 The younger the child is, the more likely they'll forget what you taught them yesterday. So, this stage of the child's learning is all about repetition. You do not have to do a lot of it. Once the child can repeat the object's name or can retrieve the item you might have ask them to bring, then you are good to go on to the next stage.
 One fun game is to hide the toy animals or pick random objects around the room you are teach them in, and ask them to bring it to you. But it is best to switch it up once in a while, kids are quick to pick up on patterns.
 At this point you can either do both teaching them how to read (can do this also in beginning) and speak or just speak. Start out with small phrases then go up to step by step.
 It will be best if the child is taught to talk to you in the language only versus just using the language when needed. This way the child will not forget it, even if they only talk to you.
, One way children learn language is by being social with people who also know the language. This way, it helps promote good conversation skills.
 Don't frustrate your child by doing this early on, though.
