 Apparently, it's not black magic, and no harm will fall upon the person it is cast upon. The aim is to keep the victim away from you, and they won't be cursed or harmed in any way.;
, Write the person's full name on the paper, (middle name if you can,) with black ink then cross it, with a pentagram.
, I bind thee for you to let me be protected from your harm, I now seal this charm" three times.
