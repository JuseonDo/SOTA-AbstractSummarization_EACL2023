If you are using a flat sheet, you only need to measure the depth of the mattress.;
, It should measure the width of the mattress, plus 2 x the depth, plus an additional 16 inches (20.32 cm) for seam allowances and tuck-in (8 inches on each side), and the length of the mattress, plus 2 x the depth, plus 16 inches (20.32 cm). Width + (2 x depth) + 16" and Length + (2 x depth)+ 16"








, Along one outer edge, measure over the depth of the mattress plus 8 inches (20.32 cm) from the corner of the fabric. Mark this spot.









Measure up the depth of the mattress plus 8 inches from the marked spot. Put a dot at the spot.
Draw a line connecting that dot to the mark on the edge of the sheet. Draw another line connecting the dot to the edge of the fabric on the other side. This gives you a square on the corner of the fabric.
 Repeat on the other 3 corners of the fabric or sheet.










The right sides of the homemade fitted sheet should face in.
,, You can skip this step if you are using a flat sheet.
,









Leave 1-inch (2.54 cm) wide gaps about 8 inches (20.32 cm) away from the sewn-together corners on each side of the sheet. This allows you to thread the elastic through to make the sheet fitted.
, Pin 1 end of the elastic to the gap on 1 side.









Attach a safety pin to the end of the elastic to help you push it through the hemmed edge of the sheet.
Pull the elastic so that the sheet corner gathers around it.
Pin the other end of the elastic to the sheet on the other end.
