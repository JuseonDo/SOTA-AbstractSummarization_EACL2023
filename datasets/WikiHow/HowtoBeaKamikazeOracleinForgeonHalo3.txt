 The Forge can be accessed between the 'Custom Games' and 'Theater' options on the Halo 3 main screen. Any map will suffice, but preferably one with some kind of walled structure.;
, Sometimes the host of the Forge session can block others from using editor mode, so if this has happened, make sure he lets you use it.
 If there aren't any, create a few by entering the Forge object menus and placing them on the map.
, Try to throw it so that the grenade 'skims' the wall as it goes up so it is basically right above you.
 This may take a few tries, so be patient. Crouching may increase your chances of success since you have a larger area for the grenade to stick on.
 You must be quick on pressing UP on your D-Pad to enter editor mode before the grenade explodes on you. Once in editor mode however, the grenade will not kill you until you exit editor mode again. You may function as normal in other respects however.
 Finding one which is unaware of your presence or of what you are doing is even better, as they will not know what hit them.
 You will explode instantly from the plasma grenade which you stuck to yourself and hopefully kill the person you were next to (or at least give them a fright if you weren't close enough). It will count as suicide, but you will get the kill point if you manage to kill the person you were next to as well.
 It may get boring if everyone continues to do it, but it will keep Forge sessions exciting for a while.
