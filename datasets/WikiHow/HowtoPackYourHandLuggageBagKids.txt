 It should be lightweight, comfortable to hold, and the right size (some airlines have rules to say a bag can't be over a certain size).;
, The average is about 5kg, but airlines have a smaller limit, and some have no limit.
 The longer it will be, the more amusements you will want.
 You might want to consider:

, Don't pack more than about 4 books, as they are heavy, and sometimes a bit difficult to pack.
 Some websites will send you free magazines and comics (The British Heart Foundation send out their 'Healthy Heart' Magazine to members of the UK monthly, and it is quite a thick magazine), but it is better to buy them, as you will be able to get the types that you like. Try to pick ones which you will be able to read more than once.
 If you have a certain doll, toy or teddy that you know you will need, pack it! If you have a teddy you can't sleep without, pack it!

, Remember any chargers, ear phones and insert able games - for example, a DSi is useless without games!

,, You don't want to have to go all through your bag to find your passport, do you?

,, Generally, all fluids have to go together in a small, clear plastic bag, to be removed when you go through security. If you really need fluids, give them to whoever is in charge of the clear plastic bag.
 Make sure that you do not overstuff the bag and that you can close it with ease at all points of time.. If your bag doesn't zip due to lots of items, take an item that you don't really need out of the bag.
 If it exceeds the weight allowance, take something out!
