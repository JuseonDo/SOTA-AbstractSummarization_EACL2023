 This will keep it safe from harsh substances or weather and protect it from scratches.;
,,, Look for the Nintendo seal on all chargers, styluses, etc that you buy.
 A power surge could damage the electronics.
 Don't use any liquid spray on it, for obvious reasons. Clean the screen well, so it doesn't get greasy or dirty and so you can view your game properly.
 If it doesn't fit, don't get angry and try to stuff it in, this will just damage the game and the game slot. Try turning the cartridge around; you might be inserting it in the wrong way.
 If you do, it will scratch your DS's screen much faster and worse than a stylus. Just go to a Gamestop or another game store and get a new stylus, or buy a pack online.
