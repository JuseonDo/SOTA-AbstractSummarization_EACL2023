 You could find these at nearly any store. If you really want to get into it, try get a shade close to "Colombia Blue"., The design isn't very different from Dawn's anime appearance, except that the skirt has large pleats., They are the same shade as her tank-top. She also wears white sneakers with one pink horizontal stripe on each shoe. You can easily find blue socks at a regular store. For the sneakers, you can buy plain white sneakers and paint a pink horizontal stripe with shoe paint., It is white, with a pink half moon shape, rotated 90 degrees. You could make or buy a white hat and sew the design on or paint it on.,
