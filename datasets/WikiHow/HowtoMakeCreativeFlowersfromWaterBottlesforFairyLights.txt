@summary
start off by gathering your bottles.

@summary
now that the bottles are ready, start cutting!,

@summary
bend each slit piece backwards so that they take on a petal like shape.

@summary
using a paint kit or any color substitutes (nail polish does it just right as well), paint each petal to your liking, both above and below.drill a hole in the corks of the "flowers", just slightly larger than the diameter of the fairy bulbs so that they fit perfectly into the corks without sliding out.

@summary
finally, secure your flowers unto the fairy bulbs and put the switch on!

 You would want to make sure you have just enough to accommodate the number of fairy bulbs you will be decorating with flowers. Be sure that all the bottles have their caps on because they play an important part in this making. Using clear water bottles would produce an even better outcome after the colors are added, however, bottles of other colors can be used.


Cut the bottles just a few inches above the cap or any measurement suitable, depending on the size of flower you desire.
Take into consideration the size of the fairy bulbs as well. You wouldn't want the two to be out of proportion. Now you have what looks like a champagne glass with no base.
Carefully, make slits from the top of the "champagne glass" to the cap of the bottle. Five to six slits should be enough.
 Make sure they remain bent backward. At this point your newly formed petals have square, sharp edges. Very neatly, cut the edges round so as to create an actual petal shape and to eliminate sharp edges., Your flowers can each have a different color or each petal can differ in color. Leave them to dry after painting.,, The colors of the lights against the colors of the petals would have you not regretting one minute spent making those flowers.
