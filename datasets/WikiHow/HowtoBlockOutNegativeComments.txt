 Think of what may happen, and plan what to say. Rehearse it in front of the mirror until you've got it down completely.;
, If somebody says "You're ugly!" or makes fun of your looks, you could say "You're not so pretty yourself, you know." And don't giggle or cry after you say that. Get some water after that if you need to.
 If you're known to be lazy and annoying (for example), prove yourself. Offer to do extra work for your teacher, or be seen running around the school instead of seating on a bench, talking. If you have a bad personality towards others, that may be why you're made fun of. If you get a good group of friends they'll help you.
 Wear deodorant and shower frequently. You don't want to smell bad, as that's another reason people may make fun of you. Brush your teeth and tongue, and brush your hair all the time.
 If somebody tells you to stop, and that would normally upset you, apologize and promise not to do it again. To keep from breaking down, clench your fists and stand firm.
 Say, "Thank you!" to them, smirk and walk away.
 The next day, stay away from them!

, Don't smirk as if you're going to say "Newbie!" when a new person says "Hello!" to you. Say "Hi!" back, because they'll get their friends and pick on you if you don't be nice to them!

, Don't turn dark red and yell "I'm not stupid, you are!" Calmly say "I disagree." and turn away.
