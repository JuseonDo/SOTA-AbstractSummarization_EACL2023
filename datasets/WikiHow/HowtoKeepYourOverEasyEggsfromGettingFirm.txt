 Eggs over-easy take no more than 5 minutes, and waiting too long can result in firm yolks.;
, Turn the heat to medium-low. You want to avoid a skillet that is too hot because it will cook the eggs unevenly.
 (14 g) of unsalted butter into the cast-iron skillet after it is heated. If you are using a non-stick skillet, place the 1 tbsp. (14 g) of unsalted butter into the skillet while it heats up.


You can also use 1 tbsp. (13.5 g) of olive oil or a mixture of olive oil and butter, depending upon the flavor you prefer for your eggs.
 Swirl the butter so that it covers the bottom of your skillet.
 You are less likely to get shells in your fried egg if you crack it on a flat surface. Open the eggshell gently over your buttered skillet.


If you often find egg shells in your cracked eggs, crack the egg into a bowl first and remove the shells. You can pour the egg from the bowl into your skillet.






If the egg sizzles when it hits the surface of the pan, it is too hot. Turn the heat down to avoid overcooking.
If you are cooking 2 eggs, try to place them close together so that you can flip them together.
 This will help to trap the heat in and cook all parts of the egg.


There are 3 parts of the egg that you need to cook in this process: the yolk, the inner white around the yolk and the outer white. The outer white cooks the fastest, but the inner white takes a while to set.
 It should take 1 to 1.5 minutes for the inner white of the egg to set. Leave the egg until the inner white turns milky and is no longer clear.


If you are cooking 2 eggs, it is likely to take at least 1.5 minutes for the inner white to set on the first side and 35 seconds for the eggs to cook on the other side when flipped.
 Ensure the turner is completely underneath. Flip it quickly but gently, so that you don't break the yolk.
 Turn off the heat on your stove. The remaining heat will cook the egg.
 Flip the egg again and remove the skillet from heat.
 Season with salt and pepper.
