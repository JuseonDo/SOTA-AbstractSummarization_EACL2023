 (If you are in the city, travel to the big bulky ship floating above the water, (hijack a car and keep flying around till you find it) and click the triangle button., this should show you a short cut scene (which you can skip by clicking the triangle button again) and you will find yourself in the desert, walk toward the huge wall, its impossible to miss, if you don't find it within a few seconds of walking in the desert in a straight path you're going the wrong way, after you find it follow it to a big door, wait a while and it should open slowly, go through the doorway and you will find yourself in an open area filled with vehicles, another, smaller door, should be straight on front of you, once again wait a while and it should open.)

,, They will first jump back or fall, but once they get back on their feet they will immediately shoot at you. Right after shooting them run till you are at a reasonable distance from the person you fired at, distance will vary depending on experience.
 Once you have gotten two people to shoot at you, run fast as you can while constantly jumping.
, Use light wings (L2+X) and "fly" as high as you can, then watch the show, or if you have already gotten unlimited light jak then you could stay on the ground and hold light shield (L2+O).
