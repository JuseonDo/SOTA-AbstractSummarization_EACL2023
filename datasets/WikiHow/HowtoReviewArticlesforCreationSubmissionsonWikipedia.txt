, This gadget will make it easy for you to review Articles for Creation submissions.
, This will take you to a category with submissions that are waiting for review.
, Look for if the subject is appropriate for an encyclopedia, if there's enough info for someone to know what the subject is about, if the subject is notable enough to have an article, and if the submission is well-sourced with secondary sources independent of the subject. You'll want to read the notability and verifiability pages to understand exactly what Wikipedia is looking for in an article.


,


If you decide to accept the submission, click on "Accept," choose what you want to assess the article as (although this is optional, it's recommended that you do so. Read the assessment page for what you can assess an article as), move the article to another title if necessary, and click on "Accept and publish to mainspace."
If you decide to decline the submission, click on "Decline," choose the reason that you are declining the article, leave a comment if you want to, and click on "Decline."
