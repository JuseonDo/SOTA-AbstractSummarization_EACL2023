@summary
make sure you know how to speak in present tense otherwise it'll be very difficult.

@summary
learn that there are 2 different ways of speaking past tense - passé composé and imparfait.

@summary
passé composé is relatively easy.

@summary
first, write down the conjugations of the verb avoir: j'ai, tu as, il a, nous avons, vous avez and ils ont.

@summary
for all the other verb groups this is the same with the exception of the endings.

@summary
for imparfait, it is even easier.

@summary
this is the same for all groups.

, The first is for something that has been completed, like "ate" or "jumped". The second is more of a continual action, such as "was going" or "was eating".
 You need to learn the avoir (to have) and the etre (to be) verbs really well. Take the verb manger (to eat) for example. This has an -er ending so is part of the first group.
 Then add mangé on the end of those:



j'ai mangé







tu as mangé







il a mangé







nous avons mangé







vous avez mangé







ils ont mangé







, Most words with ir will conjugate to i or s, oir to u, and re to u.
 Put the whole verb down, e.g. je parle (parler), take off the -er and then add ais:



je parlais







tu parlais







il parlait







nous parlions







vous parliez







ils parlaient
