 You can teleport there if you are far away or you can run there. You can also (but this is not recommended,) commit suicide fighting something higher than you and automatically go to Lumbridge (this does not work in the Duel Arena).
 Put all the items in your inventory inside. You can also deposit your armour so you can run faster.
 You'll need a handy pair of shears. These can be bought at the General Store for a very cheap price. Get about 27 of them.
 This way, you can continue your task of making money.
 By now, you should have about 1.2k of wool.
 Wool sells for over 100gp on most occasions.
