 Try to use a sturdy sheet of paper, such as cardstock or even an index card. If you absolutely can't get any, use regular printer paper., The line should go from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. This will be your cutting line. Leave the other square blank.
 You will end up with two triangles. Discard one of those triangles. You will only need one.
 Place the square on a piece of duct tape, then trim off any excess tape. Flip the paper over, and repeat this step for the other side.
 Cut a 3½-inch (8.89 centimeters) long strip of duct tape, and set it down in front of you, sticky-side-up. Carefully place the paper triangle on top of it, with the tip of the triangle touching the top edge of the tape. You will have some tape sticking out from under the triangle.Make sure that you are putting the triangle right in the middle of the tape.
 Make sure that the bottom edge of the triangle is in the crease of the tape. Be careful not to fold the paper., Make sure that one of the corners of the square is aligned with the top point of the triangle. You should see a diamond shape with two flaps of tape sticking out to either side of it.
 Take the left flap of tape, and fold it down onto the square. Then, take the right flap, and fold it down onto the square as well., Flip the bookmark over. You'll have a diamond shape with a pocket at top. You can now slide this pocket over the page you want to mark.
