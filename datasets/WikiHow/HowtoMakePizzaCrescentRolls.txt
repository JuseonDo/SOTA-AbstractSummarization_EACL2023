 You can make them smaller than the size they come in, or mush them together to make bigger ones., You can choose to add as much or as little as you like., Again, add as little or as much cheese as you wish., Starting at the biggest end of the triangle of dough, roll it up. This might get messy depending on how much sauce and cheese you used, but they'll still taste delicious no matter how they look., Make sure they aren't touching., This should be for about 9-11 minutes.,,
