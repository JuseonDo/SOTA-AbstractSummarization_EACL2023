 This browser's icon resembles a red "O".
 It's in the top-left corner of the page.
 This option is near the bottom of the drop-down menu.
 It's below the "Settings" heading near the top-right side of the page.
 This option is below the "Languages" heading about halfway down the page.
 This button is in the bottom-left corner of the window.
 This box will have a language's name (e.g., "Afrikaans") written in it.
 The languages in the drop-down menu here are listed alphabetically, so you'll likely need to scroll down.
 Doing so will add the selected language to your Opera browser's "Languages" menu.
 Doing so will make it your preferred language for any pages that support the language.
 It's the blue button in the bottom-right corner of the window. Once you restart your Opera browser, you'll see your selected language on any pages that support it.
