@article
 A few games of chess, maybe some timers.
 A coffee shop could work. Ask the owner for permission first, though! Most of the time they will appreciate the extra business.
 You can do this online (in local forums, or start a meetup.com group even). You can also post flyers.
 Check with everyone who's interested to make sure it's a good time for them.
 Set some ground rules and start playing chess!

,, Ask a teacher, councilor, principal, anyone who works at your school.;
, Everyone has friends, regardless whether you're popular or not. So why not ask them to join the club with you? Or, if no one wants to you should do Step number 3:

,, Preferably with an artsy friend. Ask if you can announce it on the announcements or advertise it in the newspaper. Make sure you have permission, though!

, Well, you have to have a place to do it, right? So ask maybe a teacher who doesn't teach a "required subject." (i.e. band, art, drama, P.E., music, etc.
 Never do it on a weekend!!
