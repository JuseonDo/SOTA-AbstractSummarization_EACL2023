 Lighter hair is very flattering as we age, try to keep it a color range that complements and does not wash out your skin tone. Ask a friend to help you choose the right shade if you need help deciding.;
, Get rid of all of the millions of face products and get the basics like a gentle cleanser (which in itself will improve skin and eliminate or greatly lessen all of the need for all of the face makeup) and a really good moisturizer and sunscreen.



Put a spot of concealer or foundation on really distracting troublesome spots or a bit of foundation, a bit of eye pencil to define and darken and enhance eyes, mascara (one coat black) and go over it with either a lash comb or learn how to apply to get rid of clumps (yes, it is possible; roll and keep the wand moving and don't place the head parallel to lash hairs).
If you're really pallid, put one dot of a cream blush the color of your cheeks when they're blushing on ring finger of each hand. Dab onto cheeks and lightly blend slightly down and out back towards the ears. A very light dusting of translucent or yellow based powder applied with a brush over places you applied makeup like foundation or concealer will help set the stuff all day and you are done.
A good clear or slightly tinted lip balm (color should be a shade darker than your natural lip) instead of lipstick is all that is needed. DON'T FORGET A GREAT RED, ONE THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR SKIN TONE, FOR THAT SPECIAL NIGHT OUT!

, Put it on while your face is damp in the morning and you won't need more moisturizers and will eliminate the zit problem which many adult women complain about, not realizing that the amount of stuff on the face is the root of the cause.
 Just stick to pure water and carry one with you and drink from it all day.

, Have fun, enjoy life, live it to the fullest!!
