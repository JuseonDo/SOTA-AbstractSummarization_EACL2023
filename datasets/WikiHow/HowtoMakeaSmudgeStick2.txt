 Remove any spotted or brown leaves. Arrange the leaves into bundles of the same lengths., Hold the bundle in one hand and wind the string up the bundle. Once you reach the top, wind the string down the bundle creating a crisscross design. This helps hold all the leaves in place. Wrap the leaves as tightly as possible. Tie another knot at the bottom of the bundle., You can hang them on a drying line, or lay them flat to dry. If you lay them down flat, it is better to put them on a screen to help airflow. It is also good to flip them over every day or so. Depending on how humid it is, it can take up to a few weeks
