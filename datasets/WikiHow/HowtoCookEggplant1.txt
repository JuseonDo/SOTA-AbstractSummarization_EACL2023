, Allow them to rest for about 15 minutes, until they've released their moisture. Pat the slices with paper towels, turn them over, and repeat on the other side.
 Mix the ingredients together in a shallow bowl. Double the ingredients for a larger amount of eggplant, and add more or fewer spices to taste.
 Add more eggs if you're frying a large amount of eggplant.



Use about 1/4” (.6cm) of oil, or enough to float the eggplant pieces in a skillet.






Peanut oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil are good choices for deep frying. Do not use olive oil, as it cannot be heated to a high temperature.



Tap the eggplant slices on the side of the flour bowl to remove excess flour.






Make sure each piece is thoroughly coated in flour.






For an extra-thick batter, coat each piece in egg and flour, then coat them a second time in egg and flour.



Don't overfill the pan. Fry one layer of eggplant slices at a time, and repeat with an additional batch if necessary.
 Flip them and let the other side brown.

Fried eggplant gets soggy if it sits too long. It should be eaten right away, while it's still hot.






Try serving fried eggplant with marinara sauce or tzatziki.
