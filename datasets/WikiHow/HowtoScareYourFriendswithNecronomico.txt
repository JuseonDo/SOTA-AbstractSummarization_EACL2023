@summary
try to slip into the conversation that you've seen something really disturbing recently.

@summary
explain to him that there are a few rules to obey (if the victim asks why, just tell him about a friend of a friend that didn't ask to leave and got rashes all over his body and has been having nightmares ever since.. you'll know what to do..).

@summary
take him somewhere you have complete control over the environment, like your house.

@summary
turn off cell phones, and every electronic device you can, except for your computer.

@summary
when you get there, the trick is quite simple.

@summary
start with some general and simple questions, just to get him to see that it really works.

@summary
move on to some more creepy questions, like

@summary
"what is your name?",

@summary
once you see that the victim is really believing in it, tell him/her to do stuff, like:

@summary
"take your shoes off"

@summary
"draw a pentagram on your forehead"

@summary
,

@summary
if you get him to really believe in it, you can finish this off however you want.

@summary
at the end, don't forget to tell him that it was just prank.

@article
 You have to look worried about what you've seen and it has to look legit. After a while, agree to show him, but only if he "promise he won't tell anyone about it".;
, The rules are:


The room has to be exactly as the book pleases
You have to always call him master always
You cannot leave, until he gives you permission to do so

, When you get there, set up te room with as many creepy things as you can, turn off the light and light up a candle, spread skulls and other "demonic" stuff.. Be creative.
 Then Head on to www.necronomi.co . Remember to turn on the sound.
 All you have to do is press the ";" (semicolon) key to toggle between "answer mode" or "question mode". In answer mode, you'll type your answer secretly. In question mode you can type normally and finish the question started. As an example:


Press ; once (toggle answer mode on)
Type "no, light a candle" -  The input box will show "Please master, tel"
Press ; once again (toggle the answer mode off)
Type "l me if the room is to your liking."

, For example:


"Master, what's my phone number?"
"What's the color of my friends shirt?"
"What's the name of my brother?"

,
"How did you die?"
"Can you see us?"
"Are you here in the room?"

,, It depends on how big of a scare you want to give him. Try to think out of the box and ask yourself: "what would be (victim's name)'s greatest fear?". Some ideas are:


Q: "Do I have a chance of hooking up with (crush's name)?" A: "No, s/he is gay."
Q: "How old am I going to die?" A:"22"
Q: "What is my friends father's name?" A:"Ernest(?!)"
