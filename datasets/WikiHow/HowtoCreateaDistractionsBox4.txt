 If you are feeling any of the following things you should head for your box!


Anxiety
Low mood
Self harm urges
Anger
Stress
Any other emotion that is restricting you from enjoying your day

, Take these out of your box and use them. For example if a film, bar of chocolate and candle catch your eye, put on your film, light your candle and enjoy your chocolate. Or, if you prefer the look of your bubble bath, a good book and a cup of herbal tea, head for the bath with your comforts in tow!

, You have beaten what was getting you down!
