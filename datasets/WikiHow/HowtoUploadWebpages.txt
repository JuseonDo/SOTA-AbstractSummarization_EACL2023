 You can use a free site if you don't mind limitations and having the free host include its name in your site's domain name. If you want a more professional site in which you have much more control, then find an appropriate host to meet your needs. Hosts range from free, to cheap, to very expensive.


Assess the purpose of your site, the requirements you need, and the cost involved, and then choose a host to fulfill that purpose.;
, You can secure an available name from your host. If you paid for a domain name then it will be unique. If you are using a free host then their brand name will likely be included in the domain name.
 Most hosts include software as part of the service you get for using them. There are also many free FTP programs and also some commercial FTP software, if your host does not provide one or if you want something more advanced.
