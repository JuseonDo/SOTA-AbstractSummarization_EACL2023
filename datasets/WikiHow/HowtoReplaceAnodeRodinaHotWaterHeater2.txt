,, If any large pieces of rust come out, you need to replace the tank. If only discolored then runs a little clearer, drain out a few gallons so there is enough drained to not leak when removing the rod., You probably will need an impact wrench with a 1-1/16" socket to break it loose. Use short burst to break it loose, then finish turning it out by hand., This way you don't have to bother with draining the entire tank, removing the plumbing, and tilting the tank., You can then feed it back in and flex it as needed., Tighten it up snug, but don't over tighten it., Then before turning on the power or gas, check for leaks around the rod. If it leaks, tighten it some more until it stops. If it doesn't leak then go ahead and turn a hot water faucet on to let any air escape. After it quits surging, then turn the power or gas back on.
