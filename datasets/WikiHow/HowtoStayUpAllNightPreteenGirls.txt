, Get a large purse or bag that will hold your things. Include a small handheld device, like an iPod or phone, lots of icy cold water, earbuds, salty snacks, candy and a gaming console like a D.S.
 While you wait, you can read, draw, play, listen to music with headphones or watch TV with a low volume.


When you're sure your parents are asleep, you can be a little louder, but don't be too loud you can wake your parents up! At about midnight, your parents are probably fast asleep, so you can text or call friends who might be awake near midnight.
 This is a great way to get your heart pumping, but don't be too loud, dancing and stomping could awaken your parents!

, This is another way to wake yourself up.
 At about 2:00, you might start to get hungry. Salty snacks like goldfish or pretzels are suggested.
 You could also find some fun new youtubers! Having a laugh is a great way to stay awake.
 (This is basically morning.) If your parents ask why you are up early, say that you woke up because of a frightening dream, or you woke up and just couldn't fall back asleep. Have a healthy breakfast, and enjoy some morning cartoons. At five or six o'clock, you might be able to watch the sunrise!

, Sleep for however long you need to, because no sleep over a long period of time can give you hallucinations.
