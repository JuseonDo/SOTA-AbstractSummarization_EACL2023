 The purpose of keeping your tax records is to support (verify) that items you have claimed as income or that you have deducted from your income, are legitimate and allowable by law. You must keep all your tax records at least until the period of limitations for a particular tax return runs out. (The period of limitations is the specified time in which the IRS allows you to amend your tax return, to claim a credit or refund or the period of time that the IRS can assess additional tax).;
, If your tax return is audited within the statute of limitations, which is usually 3 years, you will need all your receipts, cancelled checks or any other documents that will verify that your deductions were legitimate and allowable by law.
, This includes any records that relate to bad debts, losses or worthless securities.
 A net operating loss for your business can be carried back up to 3 years, but it can also be carried forward 20 years. If audited, you will have to provide proof of a NOL for the amount of time you carry it forward, in addition to the three-year statute of limitations on your original tax return file date in which you used the carry forward option.
