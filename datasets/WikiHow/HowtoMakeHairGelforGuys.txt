After stirring for some time, you will notice that the seeds are going to float at the top, and the water will thicken as desired.
This is the perfect time to pour the liquid, as the water is in the perfect consistency. This is not too thick, but slightly watery. This is the best form, as it is easy to stir. And don’t worry; it will thicken as it cools.



Drain the remaining into another container, and repeat the draining part just as before. The end part is always the thickest, so prepare for the best one.
Keep draining this for at least 4-5 times and you will get the thickest product.
 And this is the exact consistency that you want for the gel.



Vitamin E for preservative, antioxidant that improves circulation of the scalp and it is great for hair repair.
Basil essential oil nourishes the hair and scalp, strengthens hair and promotes circulation.
Rosemary essential oil – antioxidant helps prevent hair loss and helps in increases circulation and hair growth.
Ylang Ylang stimulates hair growth.
Lavender essential oil is for hair growth and circulation.



The stuff will become very thick, and it will bounce back on taking a bit with the stick. It is fun to test… so go for it!

, It will easily last for 4 – 5 weeks, as the oil will help to preserve it. The finished product is really gooey and wonderful to USE.You will get lot of gel with just a quarter cup of flax seeds.
