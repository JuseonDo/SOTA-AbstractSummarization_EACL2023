start by coloring lightly with a base color, then add lighter and darker colors to show highlight and shadows (this will make the object look three-dimensional).

,, Color in opposite directions to hide your pencil lines; however, don't smear the pencil to hide the lines because it looks very unprofessional, as does coloring flat and not mixing colors.. Using complementary colors (colors opposite on the color wheel) will dull down a color if it is too bright.


Color with the side of the pencil if your filling in a big area, the tip if you're coloring a small area.
It helps to sketch it first.
