With his left arm, he will shoot a fireball like King Dodongo.
With his right arm, he will shoot beams like Gohma.
With his left/right shoulder spikes he will shoot seeds like Manhandla.
When flying, he will breathe fire and his tail will turn blue like Argorok.
He also will roll, essentially trying to bulldoze you, similar to what King Dodongo does.;
, Every time you hit him, he will stop doing whatever attack you prevented. By using bombs, you can make him stop with the fireballs by shooting them onto his left arm before he fires them, just like King Dodongo. (Except, fire the bombs at his left arm, not his mouth.)

 Every time you hit him he will stop doing whatever attack you prevented. By using arrows, you can make him stop shooting beams by dodging the beams and then firing an arrow at his right arm when the eye on it turns blue, just like Gohma. (Except, fire the arrow at his right arm, not his eye.)

 Every time you hit him, he will stop doing whatever attack you prevented. By using the boomerang twice, you can make him stop shooting seeds by waiting until he rears back to shoot the seeds to run away and then firing the boomerang at him while he shoots the seeds.

 Every time you hit Ganon, he will stop doing whatever attack you prevented. By using arrows several times, you can make him stop rolling by dodging the roll and hitting the diamond on his forehead when it lights up.
 Just remember: Bombs. Arrows (to arm). Boomerang. Hookshot. Arrows (to diamond).
