@summary
trim away some or all the sweatshirt banding, depending on if you want your cardigan's sleeves, neck or bottom to taper.

@summary
measure your sweatshirt horizontally across its center.

expedite this process with a speedy, but less exact, method.
@article
 Removing the banding now keeps it intact for later projects.


Place a straight edge against the bottom of the sweatshirt to make sure both of its layers are even.
 Divide that measurement by half to find your sweater's horizontal center.


Place a straight edge vertically next to this point, and use fabric chalk to mark a straight, centered vertical line down the center of the sweatshirt.






Cut down the entire chalk line to create your cardigan.


Fold the back of the sweatshirt onto itself lengthwise, so that the shoulders and arms meet exactly. Since you've hidden the back of sweatshirt with the fold, only the front is visible.






Cut along the fold through only the top layer, which is the front of the sweatshirt.
