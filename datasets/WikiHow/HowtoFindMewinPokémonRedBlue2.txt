 This glitch requires you to battle the trainer hidden in the grass and Youngster (both in Cerulean).
 You can find it on Routes 24 & 25 in Pokémon Blue/Red and on Route 5 (you may need a Pokémon who can put it to sleep).
,, Press start at the same moment.
 The trainer will see you but you'll find yourself at the Cerulean Pokémon Center anyway.
 Make sure you don't get into any random battles before him and to leave a gap between him and you (so he'll be able to walk).
 You'll be outside the Pokémon Center again.
 At some point the Menu will pop up. Exit it and you should find yourself in a battle with Mew!
