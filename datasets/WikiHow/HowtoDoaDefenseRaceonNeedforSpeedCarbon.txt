 And you own Downtown now. First, the main attacking crew is Scorpios, and when you see this, You will be automatically at a race that you finish already. You and your crew member will race together. A turner is good at turns. A muscle is good at speed. An exotic is good at both. So however, You'll be at any race.;
, There is also scouts.
 Shortcuts are much faster than going on the main track. Like your racing on Main Street in Downtown and you find a shortcut that is sanded due to construction, You will get a very big jump and down into a tunnel and go back on the track.
