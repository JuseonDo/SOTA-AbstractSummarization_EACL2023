You can vary the amount of water, but that will effect how strong your water glows. More water will dilute the glow, and less water may make it shine more intensely.;
, Once the highlighter is open you can remove the felt ink tube from inside.


The gloves will protect your hands from getting stained with ink.
Not all highlighters work. Even if you test them under a blacklight and the ink appears to glow when you write, they may not work once diluted in the water. Your best bet is to use a standard yellow highlighter.
 It will only take a few minutes for the ink to begin mixing with the water. If allowed to soak for several hours, the water should glow very bright.


Use gloved hands to twist and squeeze ink out of the tube when you are finished.
When the ink tube is whitish, it means most or all of the ink is now in the water.
 The water will only glow in the presence of a UV light. Blacklights and blacklight bulbs can be found at party stores, lighting stores, or online.
