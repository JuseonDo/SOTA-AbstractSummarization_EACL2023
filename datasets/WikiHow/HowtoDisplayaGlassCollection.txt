 Look for one with shelves spaced for the height of your items. Shell collectors and insect collectors actually have special boxes with glass lids made that can slide out of their cabinets like drawers.
 A set of glass shelves attached to a window frame would bring the natural light through your glass collection and could be admired from both inside and outside your home., These are generally made of widely spaced wire mesh or rods, so you would need to place a shelf (preferably clear glass) over the wires to allow the items to sit level while still allowing maximum light through., This is not recommended for heavier pieces, however, as they require more solid support and nobody wants large glass vases and figurines suddenly cracking through their shelves and shattering on the floor., For instance, windowsills are excellent for smaller items and other horizontal areas (book shelves, top of the piano, coffee tables, end tables) work for the remaining larger items.
