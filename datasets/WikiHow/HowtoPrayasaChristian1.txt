 He spoke about the branch and the vine, describing the type of relationship you are meant to have with Him; a close, dependent connection. He promised that you could have whatever you asked in prayer if you were abiding in Him. This is where all effective prayer starts; close intimate fellowship with Jesus.



Strand 2: Believing

As a Christian, you are called to rise above the natural circumstances of life, and live by the promises of God. Just as Peter stepped out of the boat and walked on the water when Jesus called him (story in Matt. 14:25-33), you are to walk by faith and not by sight. As you allow the word of God to become your standard for living, you will find the courage you need to step beyond the natural, and do exploits for God.



Strand 3: Confronting

Only Christians have the authority to resist the spiritual forces of darkness. The Bible says, “The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8). Confronting is standing against the enemies of God for the purpose of setting the captives free.
