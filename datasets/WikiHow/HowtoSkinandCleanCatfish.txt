 Locate a length of rope, a pair of pliers (regular, not needlenose), a fillet knife, and some kind of large knife, such as a butcher's knife.;
, Not only is it humane to ensure this, but this will help prevent injury. If in doubt, cut the tail off to bleed the fish.
 Next, gut the fish, being careful not to puncture any of the organs. Then remove all the fins at the base (use the pliers to hold the fins while you cut).
 Cut the skin down the center of the back.
 This may take a while to perfect but practice will help you to improve.
 Cut the tail off if it has not already been removed, and cut the head off using the large knife.
 Cut along the backbone, until you reach the ribs, and then cut from the top of the fish down, beside the spine, and let the edge follow the ribs.
 When both sides of the fish are filleted, the sky is the limit on the number of recipes and dishes you can make, or create.
