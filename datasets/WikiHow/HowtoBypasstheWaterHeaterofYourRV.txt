, This is usually behind a cabinet door, or behind a small piece of paneling screwed to the wall.
 You should be able to see the water lines running to and from the water heater.
 There should be either one or three valves.
 Depending on whether you have a one valve system or a three valve system, here is what to do next:


One Valve System: Turn the valve to the vertical position. This valve should be on the lower line connected to the water heater.
Three Valve System: Turn the top and bottom valves to the closed position (usually perpendicular to the line). Then turn the middle valve to the open position (usually parallel to the line).
