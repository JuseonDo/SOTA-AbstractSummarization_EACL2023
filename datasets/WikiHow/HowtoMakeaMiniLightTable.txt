 If you have glass or Plexiglas, it is a good idea to make the same size. This article used an 8 X 10 (20 - 25cm) a picture frame with a glass insert, easily obtainable from a dollar store.;
, Cut the closing flaps off the box.
 It will need to be large enough for your light source to get in.
 Suitable materials include Mylar, aluminum foil, whatever you have that reflects well. If you eat potato chips, the inside of those bags are reflective (just be sure to give it a good wash first, to remove the salt). Start lining the box with the reflective material. Be sure to use reflective or transparent tape when sticking it into place.
 Turn on the light and it's ready to use.


To avoid accidentally knocking the glass off, tape or glue it in place.
 Find something that is transparent or translucent on the glass and see how the subject appears in your images.
