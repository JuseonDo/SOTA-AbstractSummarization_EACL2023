For example, cutting 500 calories for 4 days is 2,000 calories.



For example, 600 calories from a class over 3 days is 1,800 calories.
 If it adds up to more than 3,500 calories, you should have lost 1 lb.


Losing 1 lb. in 4 days is very fast weight loss.
If you continue this way, you can lose 2 lbs. by weekâ€™s end.
Losing 2 lbs. per week adds up to 8 lbs. per month, a healthy a noticeable weight loss goal.
 Although actual weight can fluctuate throughout the day, if you are losing inches on arms, legs, stomach or chest measurements, you are making good progress toward healthy and substantial weight loss.


After you try on clothing or measure yourself with a fabric measuring tape, you can weigh yourself. Try to weigh yourself only once each week, at approximately the same time during the day.
Keep in mind that while you burn fat, you may also be gaining muscle.
Muscle building may keep the scale from dropping for a few days; however, muscle tissue burns more calories than fatty tissue, and you will see greater weight loss in the long-term.
