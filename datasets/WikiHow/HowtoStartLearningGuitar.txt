 Learning guitar isn't easy and if you're not committed you'll give up halfway and will have wasted your money and time.;
, This is a good investment. A good guitar can last you for decades but if you only buy a cheap or "beginner" guitar, you'll end up having to buy another one later as these are not good quality and won't sound good for very long.
 If you can't find someone you like then find out who of your friends can play guitar and will be willing to teach you.
 A good book has illustrations of chords which you can then use to practice your chords with.
 If they teach you incorrect techniques, it will be very difficult to get rid of these bad habits.
 It's better to be very good at either rhythm or lead than to be mediocre at both.
,, Most professional guitarists you hear on the radio had to work at their playing for years and years before even being slightly good.
 If you can't tune it by ear, get an electronic tuning device (ask for it at your local music store).
