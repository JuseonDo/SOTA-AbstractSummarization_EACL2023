 This way, the odor won't spread to the furniture and carpets in your home.;
, Immediately after the dog has been sprayed, wash it outside using a garden hose and the following homemade solution:


1/4 cup of baking soda, 2 teaspoons of a dish washing product, and two pints of hydrogen peroxide. Mix these in a bucket that you can dispose of after use.
Change into old clothes that you don't mind getting rid of, and wear a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands.
Use a sponge or washcloth to scrub in the solution. Be sure to keep the solution out of your dog's eyes and nose, as it can cause irritation.
 You may need to repeat this process a few times to eliminate the odor completely.


Be sure to thoroughly rinse your dog with lukewarm water to completely remove the solution, and dry your dog when you are finished.
Wash your dog with a cream rinse after about one week. This will help restore the moisture to your dog's coat.
 The longer you wait, the more difficult it will be to fully remove the smell.
 Use a sponge or towel to thoroughly scrub the mixture into your furniture.


You can also clean outdoor furniture with bleach. Combine one part bleach with nine parts water.
 Use a hose to spray down the furniture and let it dry. You may need to repeat this process a few times before the odor goes away completely.
 Vacuum the area thoroughly.
 Use a sponge or towel to rub in the baking soda. This will absorb some odor and help cover up the smell.


Leave your windows open to air out furniture and carpets, and consider spraying your house with an indoor air freshener or odor eliminator.
 There are plenty of cleaning sprays and solutions designed specifically for eliminating skunk odor from furniture, clothes and pets.


These products are not always necessary, but if you have already tried a do-it-yourself cleaning method that didn't work, you can either wait for the odor to go away on its own or invest in a commercial cleaning product to speed up the process.
