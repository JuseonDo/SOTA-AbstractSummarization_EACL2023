@summary
include certain basic or nominal features, such as a minimum width of 48 inches (1200 mm), tread of 10.5 inches (275 mm), and a height of the riser or step of approximately 7-to-8 inches (175-to-200 mm) in your design.

@summary
measure the height of the stair from the bottom of the decking -- or top of the floor joist -- to the ground and then divide by the 7-to-8 inches (175-to- 200 mm).

@summary
lay out the steps on the stringer, using 2 x 12-inch (50 x 304 mm) treated wood, with a framing square.

@summary
cut the riser and steps out with a circular saw, but stop just short of cutting through.

@summary
install the stringers by attaching them at the top of the deck outside the framing using metal floor joist hangers.
@article
 The stair stringers should not be more than 16 inches (400 mm) apart. Set the foot on either a 6 x 6-inch (150 x 150 mm) treated wood timber or roofing paper (if set upon concrete) to prevent rot.


Ideally, the stair tread should be built from a composite wood material designed for exterior decking for its durability.;
, This will give you the number of steps you will need to make.

Adjust the height until the height and steps balance out (since you can't have a half or quarter of a step). Take the number of steps and multiply that by 10.5 inches (266.7 mm). That gives you the length of stair stringer necessary. Take that length and project it out from the deck. Now you have the location for the footing of the stair.
 Set the riser for the height determined by your math and the step by 10 inches (250 mm).
 Use a hand saw to finish the cut.
 Establish the riser boards using 1-inch (25 mm) thick treated wood screws beginning at the bottom riser.


Stringers and risers put into place begin with installation of the treads using composite wood designed for decks (best used for durability and strength). This decking, made from specially prepared compressed wood particles comes in what is referred to as 5/4 thickness. This is 1.25 inches (32 mm) thick and comes in variable widths. Secure all with 3" (75 mm) deck screws.
