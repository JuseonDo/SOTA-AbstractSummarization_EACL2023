 If you find a way to recite the squares that is memorable to you then it will make memorizing the squares much easier.
 Pay attention to the numbers. Try singing along without looking at the numbers. Recite them from memory instead.
 Think about the song in your head, but write the numbers on paper. You will be surprised to see how easy it is to get the song stuck in your head, and as a result, the answers.
