 Usually, you must convert a compound fraction to a simple fraction before you can add, subtract, multiply or divide it.
 Write a new fraction with the total as the numerator and the same number as the denominator.


For example, 2 1/3 becomes 7/3: 2 times 3, plus 1.
 Write down the whole number you get by dividing and make the remainder the numerator of the fraction. The denominator is the same.


For example, for the fraction 7/3, divide 7 by 3 to get 2 with the remainder of one; the compound fraction is 2 1/3. You can only do this if the numerator is larger than the denominator.
