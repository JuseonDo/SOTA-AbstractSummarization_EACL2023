Before learning how to turn a horse, you should know how to ride a horse to begin with. You should be able to mount and sit on a horse comfortably.
When riding English, the horse you are riding will be a head-reining horse. This means the horse will respond to the bit in his mouth more the the reins on his neck. Learn how to move the reins at his head. To do this, you pull the reins gently to the right or left. The horse should turn his head if at a standstill. Some horses will even start walking if you turn them at a halt.
