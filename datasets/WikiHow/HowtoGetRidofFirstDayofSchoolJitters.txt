 Being prepared will make you feel more comfortable at school.;
, You can usually get your schedule, meet your teachers, get your locker combination, and tour the school.
 For your first hour write a one on the map where it is. Do that until you have all of your hours marked. Also, mark your locker, the cafeteria, gym, bathrooms, office, and the computer lab is. This way you'll know your way around everywhere.
 Do not take advantage of this. Try to be on time.
 Professional athletes use this technique all the time. By no means does this imply that if you imagine it, it will happen. But it's a start!

, When you go to school, it will be easier to bond with everyone again.
 Be sure to secure it properly.
 They will usually have updates about important things.
 If you are looking to improve your grades, go over and see what you did wrong. Was it carelessness? Try reworking some problems.
 Find a quiet room, with no distractions. Sit down and just be. Stop any incoming thoughts from entering your awareness. Meditation is something where you just be yourself and feel peace. If you do this for ten minutes everyday, you may just find yourself not as stressed. You can Google more about Meditation. It really helps!

, Look up a facial mask. Paint your toe nails and finger nails a bright happy color or, even better, lots of happy colors! Read fashion magazines and listen to music. Invite a few friends over.
 This may seem a little lame at first. Pretend that you are another student. Make sure to look into your eyes, and try not to mumble.
 Try to get ready before you have to go to school.
 Hopefully you will have some classes with them too.
