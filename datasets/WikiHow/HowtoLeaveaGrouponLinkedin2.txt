 A group conversation is a thread of messages that arrives in the inboxes of multiple recipients. All recipients can also send messages to the conversation. It’s easy to remove yourself from the conversation if you don’t wish to participate.


Leaving a group conversation will not remove you from any LinkedIn groups. If you want to remove yourself from a group, you’ll need to do so from the LinkedIn website.

When leaving a group conversation, a notification will be sent to the remaining recipients.
 You will see a list of all messages in your inbox, including group conversations.

If you’d prefer to remain a part of the conversation but no longer want to receive notifications of new messages, you can “mute” the conversation.To do this, tap the Notifications switch to the “off” position.
