@summary
start by drawing a round circle.

@summary
draw another two circles, one directly beneath the first one and another roughly 10–12 centimeter (3.9–4.7 in) away, toward the other side of the page, about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) higher than the 2nd circle.

@summary
draw four curved legs coming from the lower circles.

@summary
draw a line at the highest circle (the head).

@summary
draw two curved lines coming from the line making the pony's back, one seeming further behind from the other.

@summary
draw in a curved line coming from the flank, creating the tail structure.

@summary
search for images online as to which pony you want to draw.

@summary
erase the structural lines, and the helping lines you started out with.
@article
 The circle should be about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) in diameter, or width. Draw it near the top of the page. This will become the face.;
, These circles should measure about 3.5 to 4 centimeter (1.4 to 1.6 in) in diameter. Link the circles in a curved line. Don't worry your pony looks unrealistic compared to a real pony, it's suppose to!

, Curve the legs towards the direction of the highest circle's side of the page. The front legs should be roughly 13 centimeter (5.1 in) long, and the back legs about 15 centimeter (5.9 in) long, making the hooves appear level.
 The line will be the iconic horn. Draw an ear approximately 2 centimeter (0.8 in) away from the horn, keeping it on the head (the horn should be around 4-6cm, depending on the princess, and the ear around 2cm).
 Draw two more lines coming from the first lines, curving them upwards. These lines will make up the skeleton of the wings.
 Make this line as long or short as you want.
 You should be fine filling in the details from there. You can add your own details if you like.
 Now you can color your pony however you like! Done!
