 Most houseboat rentals provide a well-equipment kitchen that includes pots, pans, dishes, glassware, flatware, cooking utensils, dish soap, sponges and dish towels. Sheets, pillows, blankets and bath towels may also be supplied.;
, This may include food storage bags, paper products, trash bags, laundry detergent, sleeping bags, flashlights, a lighter, a first aid kit, a camera, binoculars and various types of insect repellent.
 If more than one family is sharing the cooking, have each family buy the groceries for the meals they are preparing. You might designate one person to buy all the shared beverages, breakfast items and snacks, and then divide the cost and collect the money.



Bring clothes that are suitable for the climate. If you plan on wearing a swimsuit most of the day, don't over pack. Pack a sweatshirt if you expect evenings and early mornings to be cool. PJs should be suitable for nighttime temperatures.
Think about toiletries you'll need during the houseboat trip.
 This includes swimsuits, beach towels, sun hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, flotation devices and water toys.
 Bring board games, DVDs, CDs and other amusements.
 Make sure you have the necessary fishing license.
 You might consider renting this type of watercraft if you don't own one. It expands the water recreation possibilities, makes it easier to explore shallow areas and narrow canyons, or even stop by the marina for supplies.
