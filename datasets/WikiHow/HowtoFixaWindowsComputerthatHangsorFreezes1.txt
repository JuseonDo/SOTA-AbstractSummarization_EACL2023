 It is most likely that one or more external devices connected to the PC are causing the problem. Disconnect all these devices and start up again.;
, Recent hardware/software changes you have made on your PC might also be affecting it. You can resolve the issue by restoring your PC (using System Restore) to a previous working configuration.
