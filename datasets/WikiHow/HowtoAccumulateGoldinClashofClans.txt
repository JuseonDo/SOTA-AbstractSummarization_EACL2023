  It is helpful to have (a) high level Gold Mine(s) to increase your Gold production rate. Try to build multiple Gold Mines to maximize your Gold production amount.;
,  Once you've upgraded them to level 5, you can boost the Gold production rate.


This can be done by tapping on the Gold Mine(s) and clicking Boost.  Note that you have to use Gems to boost resource buildings.



If you are in a clan with 10 members, you can attack in clan wars.
Attacking other players' bases can get you some gold as well as other resources.
Attack the goblins in single player battles to get more gold.
 The Gold Storage is the priority, then the Mines.
