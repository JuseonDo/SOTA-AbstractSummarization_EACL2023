 White glue is best for indoor projects that have a low to moderate amount of wear. White glue is also preferred for smaller craft projects rather than furniture.


If your wood project will be used regularly or is large, move on to the next method, using yellow carpenter’s glue.;
, Children’s glues are usually watered down for safety.
 Be sure to apply it to one side of the entire edge that will be glued.
 Placing it near the edge of your table will make it easier to clamp.
 Cover these scrap pieces in contact paper or tape to keep them from sticking to your wood.
 Screw clamps are best with larger projects.
 Resist the temptation to wipe it up with a wet cloth, since it can dilute the glue. Instead wipe it with a dry cloth or sand it off later.
