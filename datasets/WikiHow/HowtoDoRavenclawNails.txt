 This includes any clear varnishes too as this will affect the way the new nail varnish is applied to the nail.;
, Any shapes are suitable for Ravenclaw nails but you could consider square or rounded nails. Use a nail file, buffer and nail scissors.
 This allows the nail varnish to stay on longer and will prevent discolouration from occurring. It will also help to nourish the nails too.
 The house colours of Ravenclaw are blue and bronze. You could also use silver to add a contrast. Try to vary the shades of blue you use such as light baby blue to navy.
 These are useful if you can to do detailed nail art on your nails. Again, choose the colours based on the house colours of Ravenclaw

, You can vary them if you want to.
 The shade can be your choice, but don't go too dark or light.
, They must be dry for the next step or they will smudge and you will have to start over.
 For a neater result, apply tape in the centre of the nail, but leave space at the bottom for the area you wish to paint. This will give a straighter line at the tip.



You could leave the nails now with this simple design or you could paint on some horizontal or diagonal strips going across the nail.
, This will maintain the design and will prevent the nails from chipping.
