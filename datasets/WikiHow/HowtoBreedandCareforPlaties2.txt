, Wait several weeks between small batches of fish until your tank is fully stocked.
, This reduces aggression in males and stress in females.
 Be careful, though- females may already be pregnant when you purchase them.
 Open the bag and pour a little of the new tank water into the bag and wait another 15 mins. Carefully submerge the bag, then gently and slowly pour the fish out of the bag in to the tank. The pet store's water might rarely carry a disease, but if that is the case the fish will already have the disease; There is no need to be paranoid about pet store water, if in doubt you can perform a large water change as soon as 24 hours after the new fish have settled.
