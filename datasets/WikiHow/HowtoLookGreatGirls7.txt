 Highlight your best features, but don't wear anything revealing. Remember that black makes you look slimmer, and horizontal stripes make you appear to be wider.
 If you have something that fits well, looks good on you, and that you like, then that's good enough.
 If you outgrow something, or don't like it, then sell it! You can get money to buy something that you like, fits and looks nice!

, No teddy bear skirts if you're 13, for example, and no see-through clothes if you're 10.
, If your clothes are clashing, it's distracting and doesn't look good.
 Purses, jewelry, scarves, whatever you want, as long as it matches!

,, Anything too tight or baggy isn't particularly form-flattering.
 No jeans to a funeral, and no fancy dresses to school. Your shoes should match the "theme" of your outfit as well. For example, no snow boots with skirts.
 Nothing with stains or holes, or anything old and dirty!

, If you look terrible in yellow, don't buy a bright yellow shirt. Ask someone for their honest opinion on how the piece of clothing looks on you before you buy it.
