, If you can, put some glow-in-the-dark paint on the teeth for more scares.
 When you see them getting close to some bushes or an area with little overhead light, run ahead and hide in the dark. Be careful that they don't see you!


If you painted your teeth, quickly charge up your glowing teeth with a small flashlight. Make sure you turn your back to the street so your friends can't see you.
 Step on some sticks to make noise. As your friends come past you, dive out of the bushes, growling and baring your teeth. Land on all fours.
 Weave and turn in the streets to prevent them from following you, but this is only recommended if you're familiar with the neighborhood.
 That way, you can just play it off and act like there wasn't anything happening.
