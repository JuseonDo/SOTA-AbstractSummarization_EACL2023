, Make the “bottom” of the triangle slightly curved in, as this will be the tail fin. Extend the tips of the triangle a little so that the tail is fancier, and from each tip draw a line back to the body. Make them close to parallel with the sides of the triangle.

Draw the top and bottom fins. They are just slight extensions of the body; the bottom fin starts at about the halfway point on the body. The top fin starts right above the eye.
,, Blue tangs have very distinct colors and patterns. Your tang will look great in color (use a real picture or the example colored sketch as a reference).
