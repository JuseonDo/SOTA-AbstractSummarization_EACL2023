 You'll probably see a small screw next to the main control. That's the calibration screw.
 Twisting it counterclockwise is likely to alter the temperature range so that the fridge doesn't get as cold, but the only way to make sure is to find out which direction turns the compressor on, then twist it in the opposite direction slightly past its original position.
 Make incremental adjustments to the calibration screw until you get a good temperature for wine.
