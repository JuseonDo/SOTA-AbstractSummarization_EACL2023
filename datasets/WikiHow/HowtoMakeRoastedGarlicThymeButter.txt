;
, Use enough oil to completely cover the garlic cloves but not so much that the cloves are totally submerged.
 Simmer for approximately 30 to 40 minutes or until the garlic is soft and golden brown.
 Use a slotted spoon to do this.
 Mix well. A fork also works well for mashing soft garlic.
 Return to a sealed container (or you can use it as garlic infused olive oil).
 Process until smooth and creamy. You may want to use the “pulse” speed option to achieve the ideal consistency.
, Avoid over processing as you will want to see small chunks of garlic and thyme in the finished product.
 Add more salt if necessary.
 You only want to keep the butter in the refrigerator until it firms slightly.
,
Push the sides of the mixture together and form a roll.
Wrap the butter roll inside wax paper or aluminum foil. Tuck the ends underneath and return it to the refrigerator to firm.
 Turn the butter out onto a small butter plate. Serve with the meal, providing butter knives so that diners can help themselves.
