@summary
take a look at all of the details (and your wallet).

@summary
after you've decided on which system you want/can afford, take a look into sites like amazon or ebay if you can't afford retail price.

@summary
if you can afford retail price: check your local stores like best buy, target, walmart, and gamestop.

@summary
see if you can find a bundle pack that usually includes the system, a game, and a carrying case.

 Go to Nintendo's website and they will have a chart comparing all of the systems (click on "features" then "compare systems"). The amount you can spend on a gaming system will really effect which console you can buy.;
, If you would like to buy local, go to your local GameStop and they may have a refurbished system. Beware: If you do buy a used system from one of these sites, it may not be in perfect condition. It might have scratches or other damage. Make sure to read the description before you buy.
 Or even buy online if you want to.
 This will save you money and maybe even effort trying to find a case and your first game for the system so that when you get it you will have something to play.
