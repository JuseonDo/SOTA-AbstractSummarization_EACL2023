@article
 Make a grid on a sheet of paper with one row for each brand of vodka and four columns.


Label each row with the code for each brand of vodka.
Label the columns ‘aroma,’ ‘smoothness,’ ‘crispness,’ and ‘overall taste.’

, For example, you might state that a score of “1” indicates poor aroma, smoothness, crispness or taste; a score of “2” indicates fair rating of the category, and so on. A score of “5” indicates a superior rating in any of the categories.
