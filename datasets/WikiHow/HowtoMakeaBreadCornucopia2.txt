 The base of this horn is made of papier-mâché., Wrap the papier-mâché on top of the foil horn shape. Remember to leave the top open, about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters).

Alternatively, you can make a rough shape by using newspapers and tape and cover that with the papier-mâché.
 However, be sure to take the base shape out before allowing it to dry completely. The papier-mâché must dry both inside and out before proceeding., (Burlap is a rough spun brownish fabric). In theory, you can use other fabrics as well, but burlap looks best. Attach it with hot glue., Start at the bottom and glue it with the hot glue, going up. Attach several layers, weaving it as you go. Make it stick out at certain places, to give it a more natural look., It's now ready to be filled with anything you like.
