 Measure your doorway ahead of time. You’ll want the wire to be able to reach all the way to the top of the door frame.
 This will be your noise-making device that will notify you when someone enters.
 Make sure that it is on the inside of the door or the intruder can easily take it off. You can use tape to securely attach the alarm – a keychain alarm is pretty light. , Make sure it’s around the part that you pull to make a sound, not the keychain part. , You’ll want to knot the other end of the fishing wire around this hook. That way, when the door opens, the fishing wire will pull on the alarm pin. Make sure that the fishing wire is relatively taught.


If you just want to know if someone entered your room, just place fishing wire in the front of your door without any sound making device. If the wire is disturbed you’ll know someone came in.
 This is another way to see if anyone entered your room. It isn't exactly a tripwire, but it will notify you if anyone has been snooping around. Try to stick the piece of tape up high so that the intruder won't notice that it was there.
