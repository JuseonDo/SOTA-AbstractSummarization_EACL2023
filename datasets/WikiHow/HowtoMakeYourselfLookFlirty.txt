 Don't put too much on though; you don't want to look like you're trying too hard. It's best to just put on a light amount of make-up. BUT if you you don't wear makeup, that's okay too. Sometimes less is more.;
, Apply light pink blush for dark skin, maroon for pale skin, and if you're tanned or Asian a mild rose pink will do the trick.
 No matter what skin color, you are bright red lipstick will look amazing. Or if red isn't your color, a light pale pink will look great too!

, If you have pimples/zits, use a good-quality acne treatment product like Pro-Active. If you have moles/beauty marks, use some foundation that is the color of your skin tone and cover the blemish up. If you have rashes, skin conditions, or breakouts, try talking to your doctor to see if he/she can help get rid of the blemish.
 It makes your eyes stand out. If you want the wide awake eye look, add some eyeshadow a little darker, or a little lighter, and light mascara.


Don't wear too much eyeliner. It looks messy and like you're trying too hard to get attention.
 Put on your favorite color; usually your favorite color looks good on you. Anything that will make you feel confident. men think confidence is sexy.
,, Don't do it to much though. It's like the oldest trick in the book.
, It will complement your eye-shadow for the creases on your eyes where you would normally put some eyeliner. It makes you look more fresh and pretty.
