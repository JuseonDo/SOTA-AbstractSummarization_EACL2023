 Keep on the look-out for brands that stay for a while and are reasonably priced. The eye shadows that are priced higher are usually fantastic and last for a while, so if you can afford it, go for it. However, don't knock cheaper brands; they can be just as good!;
, Use silvers, dark and light grays, peachy colors, shimmery shadows, and any shade of brown.
 Try a few light purples, browns, and grays to see which shade looks best on you.
 Dark blues, purples, and greens will usually do it for you. The darker the brown, the lighter you will want to go. Pink looks great with dark brown eyes and a dark liner. If you want a sexy and dramatic look, go for some dark silver.
,, Blue is an eyeshadow color that really pops. Blues are all about being noticed; not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. Blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop. Just remember, when you use blue eyeshadow, keep the rest of your look simple. Otherwise you will look like you walked straight from the 80s.
 Silver/gray can create a dramatic look when used in a smokey eye. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with all eye colors except gray.
 Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown, hazel, light brown eyes, and green eyes, depending on the shade of eye shadow. Be careful to not overdo brown, especially if you have brown eyes and hair.
 Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of the best colors for spring, mellow green looks wonderful with brown, blue, and green eyes. It can be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the Wicked Witch of the West! Be careful and sparing in adding it.
 It looks awesome with brown, hazel, or green eyes, and can also make for an awesome smokey eye.
