@summary
begin or load a previous park.

@summary
go to/ make a lake, and build an island in the middle of it.

@summary
build a gentle ride, a thrill ride, and a roller coaster.

@summary
since many people will be upset because they are trapped on the island, your rating will go down, and people still on the mainland will leave.

@summary
when you get bored, gradually remove the path until they are all stuck on one square.

@summary
start again, and have fun!

 If you want to skip building your reputation and getting visitors, "Diamond Heights" is a good premade park to begin with.;
, Put food, drink, bathrooms, and information kiosks around the island. Then build a path, and add benches and trash cans. Do not connect it to the "mainland". The smaller the island, the better.
 Connect their entrances to the mainland, but have them exit onto the island.
 To prevent that from happening, cut off the path to the park exit. Then, if you want to, reroute the park entrance so that anyone coming into the park will get to a small area with a few different rides. All the queues are accessible to any newcomers, and the exits lead to the island.
 You can watch them go crazy, or drown them. Put water in the square and watch them all go down at once.
