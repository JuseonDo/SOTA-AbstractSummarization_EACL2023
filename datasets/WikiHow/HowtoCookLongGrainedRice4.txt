 Drain the rice in a colander or cook uncovered at low heat for a few minutes to evaporate the water., Add a little more water (just to produce more steam) and cook covered for a few more minutes.
 Run cold water on the outside of the pot (be ready for steam clouds) to stop the rice cooking. Remove the good rice from the center.
 Use less water (a 1.5:1 or 1.75:1 ratio of water:rice) and/or reduce the cooking time.
 Boil the rice uncovered for half the necessary cooking time, then remove it from the heat entirely and cover with a tightly fitting lid. The steam should finish cooking the rice in 10–15 minutes with no risk of burning.
