 Three is the minimum number of people who should participate in a séance.;
, This will be the person who will lead the séance and should be someone who has experience or psychic abilities.
 Are you seeking connection with an ancestor, or just wanting to see who's out there?

, Place three candles, or a number divisible by three, in the center, and place an offering of food in the center, as well.
 Light the candles, dim the lights, light some incense.
, Be guided by the light of this world and visit upon us." If you are wishing to contact a relative or friend, you may chant something like this: "Beloved (name), we bring you gifts from life into death. Be guided by the light of this world and visit upon us."

, Repeat the chant if necessary until you get a response.
 It's best to start by asking simple yes or no questions. Give the spirit suggestions for communication such as one rap for yes, two raps for no.
, While it can be startling to actually make a connection, it is important to maintain control of the situation.
 Join hands until the spirit leaves, then either replace the offerings, dim the lights and prepare for a fight, or blow out the candles and end the session for the night.
