the lower body is the next part to work on and that contains three main parts.

@summary
the next part of the lower body is the heel plant which is how you land after the toe tap or step.

@summary
the last part of the lower body is where all the power in the swing comes from, which is the pivot.

@summary
as you put the arms and legs together that creates the swing.

 This is called your stance. Also be sure that you can reach the outside pitches from where you are standing in the box. To check that, you can extend the bat out in front of you across the plate to make sure that the barrel reaches the other side of the plate.;
,, Your door knocking knuckles should also be lined up with each other. In your stance, the hands should be above your back shoulder a couple inches to where it feels comfortable and the bat can be parallel to the ground.
 The first is the step or the toe tap. That is the first movement made with the front foot. As a pitcher is getting ready to release the ball the step should happen so that you are not moving as you are swinging. The toe tap or step allows you to change the weight from the front foot to the back foot so that you have more power.
 It is to make sure that you are balanced before you make your swing.
 The movement of the pivot is when the heel has planted and the hips rotate forward giving you power as the back foot pivots, which is also called “squishing the bug.” The front leg should then be locked creating resistance from the twist of the hips transferring the weight to the bent back leg.
 One thing to make sure of as you throw your hands through the zone is to lead with your front elbow and aim for the middle of the ball. Throwing your hands through the zone is a term that means extending them fully to get all of your power behind the ball. If you drop your hands hitting the bottom side, it will pop the ball up. If you get too on top of the ball, you will hit a little grounder that may not be very hard. You have to extend your arms through the zone and use your legs for power to hit solid line drives. To check your arms in mid swing, they should be parallel with your belly button and fully extended.
 It is very important to finish your swings to give off the full amount of power that you have. So after you have made contact, your wrists should roll over and create the follow through.
