It is a good second job or job to get through college.
If you are single or a caregiver or single parent, you can adjust your schedule to meet your needs.;
,
No medical or health insurance.
No school district perks.
Some people treat you like a non entity.
 Learn their names and treat them with genuine respect

,, This is where all those classes in sociology and psychology come into play.
 Treat them and their parents with the respect and reverence they deserve. We didn't get a manual when we were born, and neither did they.
 Call for security, and/or send a trusted student to the office for assistance.
 Remember safety and dignity paramount.
 If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist. Too often, schools will sacrifice good substitute teachers to save face in the event of an incident.If negative remarks are made to your character, do defend yourself, place all information in your file, keep a copy in your personal file at home.
 Direct the student to the nurse, the counselor, their parent or other trusted adult. Do not discuss sensitive issues with students!

, And as a substitute teacher you will not be made privy to that information.
, Schedules are constantly changing.
,, Save for the summer and for winter and spring vacations.
