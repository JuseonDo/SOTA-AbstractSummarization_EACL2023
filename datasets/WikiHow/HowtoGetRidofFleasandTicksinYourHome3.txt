 Follow the pesticide manufacturer's instructions to treat your home, focusing on your carpets, soft furniture, and areas your pet frequents.


Use a pesticide with chemicals that kill adult fleas and ticks as well as their eggs.
Be sure to ready the safety instructions before you treat your house. Your children and pets should not be inside your house when it is sprayed.
If you have a serious infestation, you might want to hire a fumigator to treat your house for you. In this case your entire family won't be able to go into the house for a couple of days, since the strong chemicals used are toxic.
 As the pesticide takes action in your home, it will kill adult fleas and ticks, and continue killing them as more hatch. It may take several weeks before the fleas and ticks are completely gone.
