 Most of the dirt pileup on chrome won't need more than soap and water to dispel. Here are some of the most common cleaning solutions used on chrome:


Baby oil.
Ethanol or rubbing oil.
Cola.
Lemon and baking soda.
You can also use a chrome-friendly cleaning spray. Commonplace household cleaners like Vim Bathroom cleaning spray are well-suited to cleaning chrome., Generally speaking, chrome does not require a lot to get the grime off. Due to chrome's fragility, you should only use heavier cleaning solutions if the lighter ones don't work to clean the surface.
 As you would with soap and water, dab the edge of your towel into the cleaning solution. If you're using a spray bottle, spray directly into the towel, and apply from there. This method will allow you the most control over how much cleaner is used.


Paper towels also work in lieu of a cloth hand towel, although you'll probably have to go through quite a few in order to clean any large chrome surface.
 In spite of the soap, some grime may take a bit of pressure to wipe away properly. You may exert some force without needing to worry about the chrome being damaged.
 Following that, take a fresh towel and dry the surface completely, working in a circular motion.


If you don't dry it, it may result in residual water marks in the chrome finish.
