 Try to use fresh, ripe bananas if you can. If you like your smoothies extra thick, use frozen bananas instead. Cutting the bananas up first will help make your smoothie smoother.
 Don't add the chopped nuts yet. You will be adding those last.
 For a healthier option, use honey instead.
 The ice cubes will help thicken your smoothie. If you are using frozen bananas, you do not need to add the ice cubes.
 Keep blending until there are no more lumps or chunks of banana or ice. From time to time, you may need to use a spatula to push the smoothie down the walls of the blender. This will help things mix together more evenly.
 Keep stirring until the nuts are distributed evenly throughout the smoothie.
 If you'd like, you can garnish it with a sprinkle of chopped up nuts.
