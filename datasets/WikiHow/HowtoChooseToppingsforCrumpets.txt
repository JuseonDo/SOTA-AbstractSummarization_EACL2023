 Check that they are in date and that they are soft. Harder crumpets will stay hard when you toast them, although whether or not this bothers you is a question of personal taste.
 The most simple way to have a crumpet is to toast it and eat it without a topping. Few people enjoy this state, however, and add some butter, which is also very simple. If you don't enjoy butter, try soy or bran rice margarine.
 Savoury toppings are delicious on crumpets. Here is a selection of ideas (and butter/margarine is optional in each case):


Vegemite, Marmite, Our Mate or any other yeast extract spread
Peanut butter, macadamia nut butter, cashew nut butter, almond butter
Slice of tomato topped with salt and pepper
Melted cheese with slices of tomato, salt and pepper
Cheese and gherkin slices

, Owing to the fact that crumpets are fairly bland, sweet toppings work really well also. Here are some suggestions (again, butter/margarine optional):


Jams and jellies
Banana slices or mashed banana (cinnamon or nutmeg sprinkled on is delicious)
Nutella or similar sweet nutty or chocolate spread
Marmalade or lemon curd
Golden syrup, honey and maple syrup

,;
, Also grab tomato, cheese and salt and pepper to taste.
 Place them upside-down to make them crunchy on the bottom

,, Add salt and pepper.
 Cook until the cheese has just melted.
 Serve and enjoy!
