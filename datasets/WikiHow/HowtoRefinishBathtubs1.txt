 What's the worst part of this? The demolition. Cost: $1,000 or more.
 DIY is great for many things, but it is virtually impossible to do a decent bathtub refinishing job by yourself. Porcelain, fiberglass, and cast-iron tubs can all be refinished.
 But they are always cheaper than full replacement, and unlike refinishing, you never worry about the finish wearing away.
 Nearly impossible to achieve a smooth finish, and DIY finishes will begin to peel and chip soon after.
