 This is more successful if you hit the narrow end instead of the wide end of the egg, since the knife is more likely to go all the way through. Make sure to use a butter knife rather than a sharp knife, as you could cut yourself otherwise.
 Use a light stroke this time. The knife should cut through the shell, separating the top part entirely from the egg.
 The knife method is more similar to cutting the shell, as opposed to using a spoon to crack it. Make sure to keep the egg steady as you lift the shell off.
