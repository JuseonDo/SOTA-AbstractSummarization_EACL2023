 People will think it is really awkward for you to say Spring without it relating to something out of the topic or question.;
, Spring in Spanish is " primavera ". As the first syllable (pri) is short. The second syllable is just plain short aÂ : (ma). The third syllable is the one that carries the stress ( VEH )with a long e like in English "bed" No problem whether you say it with a "b" or a "v".The "b" is by far the most used sound.The last syllable ( ra ) is pronounced with a soft "r" like in " rat " only without the "t".
 Spend some time trying to go over the word to help remember it.
, You now know how to say Spring in Spanish.
