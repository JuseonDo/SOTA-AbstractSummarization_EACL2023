These classes are specialized, just as a contractor's license is. For example, you are required to take different tests if you want to be a residential remodeling contractor than if you want to be a large commercial contractor or a plumbing contractor.

You may also do a telephone registration at 1-800-733-926, or you may fill out the examination test form and send it into the address listed on the form in your packet.
If you take an exam on site in either the Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff or Yuma testing center, you will required to bring 2 forms of identification. You will also have to follow strict test-taking protocol.
 The bond protects the company and clients in case of bankruptcy or malpractice. The application lists how large the bond must be for your type of contracting and whether you would like to provide a cash bond, a certificate of deposit or a surety bond.
 The Contractor's Recovery Fund application fee is $450, or you can provide a larger bond. Go to azroc.gov/Recovery/answers.html for more information about the Recovery Fund.
 You may obtain a number in either Phoenix or Tucson at the Arizona Department of Revenue offices. Phone numbers and addresses are listed in the application packet.
 You will need to attach the insurance information to the application packet. This may be both business insurance and worker's compensation insurance.
 This will include the type of contractor's license you are seeking, the business organization, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation, the experience record and all business information, employees and financial details.
, Make sure you sign and date all necessary areas of the application. Incomplete applications will be returned to you, and they may require more processing fees.
