start with a piece of wood that's relatively square and is already as long as the chain that you wish to carve.

@summary
cut a notch into the length of the wood on each corner of the wood so that the wood's profile becomes a cross instead of a square.

 Basswood is recommended and you can get this fairly easily at lots of woodworking supply stores.


You could also use a 2x2 from the lumberyard, but pine wood splits easier than basswood and this will be frustrating until you get more advanced at wood carving art.
You will also need a sharp wood carving knife or a jack knife.;
,, The example shown in this tutorial has a variety of shapes. While you can use any shape that you wish, it is suggested that for your first attempt at whittling a wood chain that it is best to select one shape only to ensure consistency and ease of getting used to the whittling. For example, choose all rectangles or all ovals.
 Carefully hollow out the insides of the links, freeing the links of the chain as you go.
 For the tutorial example, the octagon links have an octagonal profile, the diamond shaped links have diamond shaped profiles, the square links have a square profile, while the round links have a round profile. For your first attempt, it is suggested to keep to using just the round profile.
 You could use the chain as a decoration, a piece of jewelry or perhaps as a baby or pet toy.
