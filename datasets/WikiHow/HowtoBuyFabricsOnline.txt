 Credible means that the store has no hang-ups in letting you touch samples sent by mail before you pay, and they have a good returns policy.;
, Don't buy very expensive yardages without seeing samples or buying physically. If you think that a certain piece of fabric is just what you want, request a sample first or purchase only a small amount before purchasing a larger amount.
 If they only accept cash or checks or money orders, look elsewhere.
 There should be guarantees of this stated clearly on the site.
 The shipping should be clearly stated. If there are packaging costs, these should also be stated to allow you to take into account whether or not you wish to pay this.
 Ensure that you can actually reach the store by telephoning before ordering. In fact, for some, this is the preferable manner by which to give credit card details.
