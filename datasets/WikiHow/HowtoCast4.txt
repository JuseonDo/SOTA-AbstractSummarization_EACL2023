 While in the other forms of casting, you’re casting a bait or lure, in fly fishing, you cast the line in a manner similar to cracking a whip with a weighted tip.
 You should hold the rod straight in front of you as you do this, reel down, with your thumb resting along the top of the rod handle.
, Keep your upper arm at your side, but raise it to a 30-degree angle. Stop raising the rod when your thumb points straight up; your forearm should also point straight up at this point.


You should do this quickly enough so the line’s weight and movement bend the rod.
To make the line move faster, pull downward on it above the reel with your other hand as you lift the rod tip.
 At first, you may want to look behind you to watch the line straighten out,but you can eventually feel a slight tug as the line straightens.
 This will make the rod move faster, giving your forward stroke more power.


You can make the line move faster still by pulling downward on it with your other hand.
 Your thumbnail should be even with your eye at this point; the snap should be sharp enough that you can feel the rod tip whip forward.
 Unlike the other forms of casting, you can add distance to how far your line travels with repeated back and forward strokes.



If you find using a fly rod too difficult, you can also cast flies using ultralight spinning gear and water-weighted bobbers. Use the casting techniques described in “How to Cast with Spinning Gear.”
