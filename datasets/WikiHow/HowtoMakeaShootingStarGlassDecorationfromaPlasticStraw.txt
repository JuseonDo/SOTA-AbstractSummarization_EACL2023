 Choose straw colors that reflect the occasion.
 Select a straw length of about 10cm (4"). You might need to cut it to size. Press along the length of the straw to fold in place a single line, as shown in the image.
 First, check this diagram and use it as a reference for each cut.

Cut the middle, thick piece first. Use the diagram and image to guide your cutting.





Cut the lower blue line from the diagram, as shown in the image.






Finish up by cutting the jagged edges at one end.
 See the image for guidance.
 Again, use the images for guidance.


This should be how the "petals" end up appearing:







,

Once curled, this is how the curl will appear:







, In order for the star straw to be able to sit on the glass rim, there needs to be a small slit to slide the straw onto the glass. Make a small snip to create this grip at the end of the straw.
 Using the small pearl bead or similar bead, fit into place in the center of the hole in the straw, to form the star's center.

It should fit snugly, as shown in this image. If it's loose at all, you might need to use non-toxic glue to keep it in place, to prevent it from dropping into the drink. Alternatively, use a small pompom that will squeeze easily into shape in the hole.






If you'd like a lively star, consider decorating it with a marker to include a smile.
 It's now completed.
 Fill with your drink and enjoy!
