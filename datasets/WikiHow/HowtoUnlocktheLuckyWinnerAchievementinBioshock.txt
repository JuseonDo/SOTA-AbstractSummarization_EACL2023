 Fort Frolic is the only level where slot machines are found, so make use of your time there to unlock the achievement.;
, There are two slot machines to your left directly after exiting the bathysphere dock, although there are numerous others on the level, including those found in Sir Prize: Games Of Chance, Pharaoh's Fortune Casino and along the various corridors in Fort Frolic.
 This will allow for one spin of the dial where you will either receive nothing, three cherry symbols worth $25, two dollar signs and one clown face symbol worth $50 or three dollar signs worth $250. You will need to get the three dollar symbols to unlock the achievement.
 It may take some time to get this and it may take a large amount of money, so be prepared.
 It is represented by a dollar sign.
