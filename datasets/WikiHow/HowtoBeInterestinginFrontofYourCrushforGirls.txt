 You are a unique individual and already blessed with positive differences from others. Capitalize on your strengths. Never try to "fit in" or change who you are as a person to have any sort of relationship, whether strictly platonic or in fact, romantic. If you feel the need, invest in a new shirt or bracelet for a confidence boost to add to that edge. However, remember that you shouldn't have to change who you are inside to get him/her to like you. Be true to yourself and what is in your heart, as that should be the ultimate attractive quality.
 Obviously good personal hygiene is a must, but spritz on a great cologne or enhance your eyes with a great new shadow color. Fun additions like these not only help with intensifying your look but also enhance your confidence level.
 Soft and sleek, curly or smooth make hair look not only clean and healthy but add to the your overall physical presentation. Maybe you could even be super-daring and go for a bold new haircut!

,, Try use little to no makeup. Boys love when the girl is either natural and subtle, or a little bit sassy with the soft flick of black eyeliner: (Glide your liquid eyeliner across the eye and end with a soft flick if you are allowed to). Nude lips are also attractive, so try out a clear lip gloss. If lip gloss isn't quite your style, try a lip liner that highlights your natural pout.
, Invest in a average sized bag with a nude colour to match your outfits! Remember to carry around your pick me up beauty supplies i.e. deodorant and mini makeup bag for a quick spritz and fresh glow.
 Smiling is known to make a person glow, so stick on your smile and show them teeth! Whether you have braces or not, people will appreciate and see the beauty of your smile.
 If he can accept you for the person that you are, then he is the best.
 This article talks about beauty tips, but a man will be captured by your presence, fun streak and mannerisms, so keep good posture, head high, smile and talk nicely. Men will be all over you. Be yourself and if you are a fun person, then beauty tips are not always essential.
 Try to avoid him a little bit, but don't show him your real feelings so easily, because this will divert his attention towards you.
 Most guys like intelligent girls so don't behave like a dumbo.
, If he sees that you like doing his favorite things, then he might like you even more and think of you as a great match for him.
 If he is interested in sports, learn everything you can about it in general, then learn the specifics for the local teams so you can offer to take him to a game. If he likes skateboarding, find out if there is a local skate park he may not have gone to yet. If he is into debates, then learn the art of debating and if he gets engaged in a topic with you, keep pace. The point is, engage in what it is that he enjoys and find enjoyment in it yourself. There will come a time when this is more important than how you look.
 Don't be bossy or rude or demanding but instead polite and girly. Offer him drinks when you get your own but don't focus on just him and look obvious.
 Also don't lie, since it's not good to start a relationship with lies. You'll only get found out later.
 This makes you more interesting, because he will see that you also have lots of friends who think you are interesting!

, You can be more confident and alluring by being interested in him than trying to sound interesting. So listen, and participate in conversation. Try not to start off every single sentence with "I". This may seem difficult, but you will find yourself asking more questions and being more involved and fascinated by your crush. People are generally not too interested in other people and their accomplishments. So if you discover some of your crush's likes, then bring up a conversation about it. Does he like hockey? Ask if he saw the big game last night. So if you become more interested in people, then you will stand out as a bright, friendly, confident girl.
 It should be something that makes you stand out from all the other girls.
 They may, however, help you keep up with the latest fashion trends.
 If you aren't yourself, then how are you yourself supposed to impress him? If he doesn't know the real you, then why did you try to impress him by not being yourself? if he doesn't like the real you, then it is his loss! Good luck!

, Put on foundation first for the base.;
,,,,,
Grab a blusher brush, and glide evenly your blusher over the cheeks to create tone.
Then if you are an eyelash curler addict, grab your eyelash curlers, and follow up with a few strokes of mascara, starting from the bottom of the top lashes brushing outwards.
Most guys do not like it when a girl plasters her face with makeup. It looks unnatural to them, and they are never fooled by make-up. So a little make-up is fine, but as strange as it may seem, guys find you more attractive with less of it.
