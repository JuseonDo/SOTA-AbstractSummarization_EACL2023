, Change directions and walk away. If it looks like it is following you, stamp on the ground to make vibrations in the ground, which should be enough to drive them away. Do consider that snakes are extremely fast and slender, so don't try to outrun it. Your movements should be slow and not provocative for now.
 80% of snake bites occur when someone tries to capture a snake. If you are being attacked by these creatures, get away from the head. This may seem obvious, but without venom, a snake may as well be a slug for all the damage it can do. Do not try to stomp on it either, even from behind, as they have sharp reactions and will sink their teeth into your ankle. Instead go for distracting it, which can include distancing yourself behind obstacles such as fallen logs, or even throwing things to divert its attention.
,, This is strictly for the movies and will not help, and may make your situation worse than it already was.
,, Their fangs are small, so they have to work to get a lot of venom into the wound. If you pull it off quickly, not as much venom will be inserted into your bloodstream.
 This will be helpful for the hospital. There is a well-told folk tale of a young boy who got bitten by a snake and was awaiting his demise. He spent what should be his last hours drawing a detailed diagram and description of the snake, and because of his attention to detail, the hospital were able to identify the anti-venom solution needed immediately and save the boy's life. While only a story, this could apply to you.
