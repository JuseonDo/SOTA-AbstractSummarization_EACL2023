 Once a spill is set, it may become a stain and become difficult to remove.;
, Vacuum both sides of the rug as well as the floor underneath.
 Sprinkle the dry-cleaning powder onto the carpet, and use a stiff bristle brush to clean the jute fibers. Shake out the rug or vacuum as needed. A dry-cleaning kit may be available at carpet stores or online that contains the dry-cleaning powder, a spot remover, and a brush.
 Follow by vacuuming.
 Avoid rubbing the spill. Club soda may be used to neutralize acidic spills such as red wine or tomato sauce.
, Mix 1 part bleach to 6 parts water in a spray bottle. Test the mixture in an unseen spot on the rug. If discoloration occurs, dilute the spray and retest. Once the mixture is satisfactory, spray a little on the mildew, and work in with a soft brush. Rub with a dry cloth after 10 minutes.
 This can minimize the jute fibers' absorbency and protect the rug from stains. This will allow you a little more time to get any spills cleaned up before they set into the rug.
