 Weak Pokémon training will help you raise any low-level or weak Pokémon easily; for example if you have caught an Abra under level 16, (An Abra under level 16 only knows the move teleport, which isn't an offensive move.) or if you're trying to raise a Magikarp. (For Pokémon fans, this should go without saying.)

, Again, find a trainer or Pokémon to into battle. Once the battle screen has opened, stop.
 Once the battle screen has opened, don't attack or use an item on your weak Pokémon. All you have to do is switch it out right away for a Pokémon that can complete the battle. Even though your weak Pokémon didn't fight or make a move, it still earns experience points just for being in the battle.
