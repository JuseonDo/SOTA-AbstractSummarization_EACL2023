 Use it for occasionally wiping your lips or fingers once seated. At the end of dinner, leave the napkin tidily on the place setting.;
, It is traditional to serve the most senior lady at the table, then the other ladies in descending order of rank (usually equating to age unless you have royalty staying), and lastly the gentlemen. Never start eating until the hostess begins to eat, then you may.
 If in doubt, have a look to see what the other guests are doing/using.
, When you have finished eating, place them side by side in the center of the plate.
 In the event of being presented with a dish which you feel unable to eat, it is polite to at least make some attempt to do so. Or at the very least, cut it up a little, and move it around the plate! It is quite acceptable to leave some food to one side of your plate if you feel as though you have eaten enough. On the other hand, don’t attempt to leave your plate so clean that it looks as though you haven’t eaten in days!

, Dinner parties are not just about the food; they are intended to be a sociable occasion.
