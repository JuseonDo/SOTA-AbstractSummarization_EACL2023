, In both Pokémon Black, and Pokémon White, the Pokémon Center is a building on the left side of the northern road leading out of town.
 You'll see a lobby with a receptionist. After talking with the receptionist, you'll then have two flights of stairs to climb.
 If you've played previous editions of the Pokémon game, you'll notice the transfer scientist's resemblance to Primo from Violet City and other similar characters.
 The unlock code consists of four words: "Everyone happy. Simple connection." This will enable the Relocator and send a download play to the other handheld game system once you confirm the request.
