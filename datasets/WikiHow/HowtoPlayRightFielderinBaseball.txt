 Outfielders usually have gloves a little on the longer side, as the extra extension helps with the tough catches.;
, So they will usually hit it into left to center field.
, Know where to throw the ball in every situation, if you don't, ask a teammate or coach. This will help you execute more smoothly. (If the first baseman wants to cutoff your throw to the plate on a tagging runner and you know you can throw at a good line to the plate, ignore him.)

, Likewise, if the ball is thrown to second base, back up the second baseman, just in case he doesn't field the throw correctly.
 Call for the ball, relax, and try to follow the flight of the ball. At first back up a couple of steps. It is easier to come in on a ball than try to run backwards.
, Don't have your arm extended the entire time. Put your glove out when you are positioned under the ball or when you are ready to extend for the catch.
 Try to position yourself so that you merely have to pull your arm back to throw, rather than having to turn your body.
 If you miss, retrieve it, and throw it to the cutoff man near second base.
 Everyone misses once in a while, including the pros. Never give up. (Remember, too, when you see others make mistakes that the same thing will happen to you sometimes. Respect others, and cheer others on.)

, Be prepared for a ground ball, and know what to do with it in every situation.
 Depending on how many runners are on base you will field differently. If there are no runners, field it like an infielder would. If there are runners and you might throw someone out, either charge and field it while running or kneel and field it between your legs to prevent it from getting by.
