 It can be your hormones, your diet, your stress and more that causes your acne.;
, Your diet should consist of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean meat. Take a multivitamin too. Also exercise. don't worry you don't have to exercise like a machine just try to be active daily. Maybe go for a walk, go to the mall, take a dance class, dance in your room, walk your dog, go for a bike ride. Sleep well. Get 7-8 hours of sleep per night and stress less. If you stress out your skin can become irritated fast and you will break out.
 You probably think water won't do anything. But your body is made up of a significant amount of water and if you drink lots of water daily you will see results. So drink up.
