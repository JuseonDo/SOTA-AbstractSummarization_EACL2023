 You will see a creature waiting there, called the Divine Skinweaver. She is not the boss, she is there to help you. She is a healer and as long as you stay on the tiles around her, she will heal you and you'll never need to eat. She will also tell you each time you should block a tunnel.;
, Stay on the tiles next to the Divine Skinweaver and be ready to attack.
 Ranged or magic is recommended, so that you can stay on the tiles. Just make sure that you take enough ammo or runes with you before you enter the room. If you are going to insist on using melee, you'll need to switch off auto-retaliate in order to stay on the tiles.
 She will tell you when you can block one of the tunnels through which the skeletons spawn. The text appears as yellow chat over her head. You can choose any of the tunnels to block when she tells you, but don't try to block any tunnel before she tells you because you will be dealt severe damage.
 Run across to the tunnel and once blocked, run back to the tiles around the Divine Skinweaver to heal.
,, The ladder to the end of the dungeon will appear. Climb up it if you wish to leave the dungeon. Congratulations! You have defeated the seemingly impossible Skeletal Horde!
