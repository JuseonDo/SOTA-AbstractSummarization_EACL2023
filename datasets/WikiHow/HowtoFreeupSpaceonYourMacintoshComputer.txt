 Find anything that seemed cool at the time but is now just a waste of valuable hard disk space. Since videos take up a lot of space, move any unwanted video to the Trash.;
, These are your iTunes movie files, and if you got them from YouTube or another video site, they take up space. This is because they are not compressed as they would be if you bought them from iTunes. Don't forget to go into iTunes and delete the files from there too! (Be careful that you don't delete files you want.)

, Check the date of your files and delete old ones.
 Many programs that you install will automatically place large foreign language help files on your computer for international users. Downloading and running a program such as Monolingual will sometimes free up a gigabyte or more of hard drive space. Monolingual allows you to select which language files to keep and which to trash.
, you can use cleaner apps such as CleanMyMac, Maintenance or Tidy up.
 Scour this folder for any applications that you don't use, and delete them with an application that removes all the related folders elsewhere on the hard drive. A good example is All cleaner.
 Delete files that are hanging around in your Trash bin.
