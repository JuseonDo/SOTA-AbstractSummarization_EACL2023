, Just try to stick it into the dread itself, as close to the end as possible, while being sure you'll be able to pull it through. This will be the beginning of a long process, it may take a good deal of strength to get the hair to undread, as well. You will likely have many loose hairs fall out, and some get pulled out, so don't be alarmed.
 Just move the comb higher and higher each time you comb some loose. It helps to brush your hair as it comes undreaded, as well. Be prepared for tired arms and broken comb teeth, as these things will happen.
 Working your way through it, and combing after to get all the knots undone.
 So go take a shower or clean your hair, continuing to condition. Then you're done, and you can go forward with undreaded hair!
