 Right-click Modloader, and then select Open with → WinRar (or another archiving utility). These are your .class files. Keep this file window open.



In Windows XP: Click on the Start button, then click on Run. Type "%appdata%" and click on "Roaming." Minecraft should be the first folder. Open it.
In Windows Vista/7: Click on the Start(Windows) button and type "%appdata%" in the search bar and again click on "Roaming."
In Linux Ubuntu (should be the same on other Linux distributions): Open up your Home folder. Look for the Minecraft folder. Note: if you cannot see this folder, enable "Show Hidden Files". When you find it, open Minecraft.
, Right-click minecraft → Open with → WinRar.
 This step is very important. If you don't adequately delete the META-INF file, your screen will go black when you try to play Minecraft.
,, After half a minute, exit out of Minecraft and check your minecraft.jar window again. If you see a new folder entitled "Mods," the installation of Modloader worked. Download mods and continue to enjoy Minecraft.
