use slender cars since they drive faster and can turn better than the big ones.

@summary
basic cars should also be used because they go faster and don't blow up as quick.

 You can do this by driving in the opposite direction they are driving in. For example,if a car is left of you on the course, go in the right diagonal from them if they are in front of you.;
, Drive fast and learn the courses. This will prevent them from sneaking up on you and pushing you off cliffs.
 This will cause them to blow up and it takes about 30 seconds for them to regain speed on the course. Perfect timing to get away from them.
, They're also not as prone to flying everywhere when going over bumpy courses. They have good control.
