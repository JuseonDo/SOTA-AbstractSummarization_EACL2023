Keep in mind that if you crash into the nice car that belongs to someone else it could cost over $50,000 to fix or replace the car. Make sure you have enough coverage.;
,,, Some people keep these in another location but this is a problem when you are at the shop, or home for the weekend. You may wish you had them in the car if someone asks when you last rotated the tires, changed the oil or transmission fluid, or flushed the radiator. Keep these receipts in the car.
 Under inflated tires cause many accidents. An under inflated tire can be torn off the rim when cornering hard causing a serious crash.
 Check the owners manual for guidance. It is recommended to change the oil every 3,000 miles (4,800 km).
 Dirty oil and dirty air filters will allow dirt into the engine and scar the inside of the engine making wear out much faster and cause early and very expensive engine failure.
 This means having the wheels taken off and put back on in different locations such as moving the front tires to the back and vice versa. This helps the tires wear more evenly and last sometimes twice as long.
 Seasonal temperature swings can change the pressure in tires even if there is no leak.
 Brake shoes eventually wear out just like the soles of your walking shoes. When they wear all the way through it can cause damage to the brake rotor that can be expensive to fix. Even though they stop the car effectively the shoes could be very thin and start damaging the brakes any time so check them visually when rotating your tires.
 These are easy to check on most cars by opening the engine compartment:


Oil
Coolant/Anti-freeze
Transmission fluid
Brake fluid
Windshield wiper fluid.
If they are low they should be topped off. If they keep getting low you might have a leak. Check your parking spot for drips.
