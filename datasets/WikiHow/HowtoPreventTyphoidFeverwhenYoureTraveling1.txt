 There are two vaccines available in the U.S. Talk to your doctor about which one is right for you.


Get a booster if it has been several years since you have been inoculated. Know that the existing vaccines against typhoid are not 100 percent effective. Other precautions listed below should also be taken as well.;
,, You should also stay away from popsicles and slushie type drinks. They could have been made with contaminated water.
 If possible, they should still have steam coming off of them.
 These foods can be very hard to decontaminate.


Always peel raw fruits and vegetables yourself. Wash your hands vigorously with soap and bottled water first. Do not eat the peels.
 Conditions are not usually very sanitary on the street.
