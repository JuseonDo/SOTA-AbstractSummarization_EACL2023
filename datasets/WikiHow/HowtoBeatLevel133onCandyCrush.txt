 Color bombs and vertical striped candies will be most effective at clearing the double jelly squares, as well as special candy combinations, such as color bomb + color bomb, wrapped + striped, and color bomb + striped.Make color bombs by matching five of the same-colored candies in a row.
Make vertical striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, and moving the fourth candy into the match in an upward or downward vertical direction.
Make wrapped candies by matching five candies into an L shape, T shape, or + shape.;
, When you match a color bomb with a striped candy, all candies on the board of the same color as the striped candy will also turn into striped candies. Those striped candies will immediately detonate, and clear all existing candies in the same rows and columns., While matches may be mostly nonexistent at the bottom half of the board, any matches you can manage to make will help clear jellies that would otherwise have to be cleared using special candies.
 Horizontal striped candies can be effective at clearing jelly squares located in the very bottom row of the playing board.Make horizontal striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, and moving the fourth candy into the match in a left or right horizontal direction.
 These jelly squares are often considered the most difficult to clear, but can be cleared most easily using color bombs.
