 Try to build your rail on flat areas with few trees at the beginning. Later after you have plenty of money you can build through forests and mountains.;
, The more resources you have at the beginning, the more money you will start earning.
 Make sure bellow the city name it says "connected" or else the city won't demand as many objects and will pay less for them.
 The reason is obvious, hence the name "Railroad Tycoon 2".
 Two trains will transport cargoes faster however maintenance bills will attack you quicker.
 After you get some money you can expand even further.
