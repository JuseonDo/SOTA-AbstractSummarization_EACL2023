 Dig is a ground-type move, so you'll get a 50% attack bonus if you have a ground Pokémon using it in battle., Dig is a two-turn attack, making it an effective way to dodge certain attacks.


In the first move, your Pokémon digs down and away from the battlefield.
On the second turn, they pop up again, doing damage and returning to normal battle mode.
 Dig can be used as an "out" while exploring, like an infinite Escape Rope. If you're ever in trouble in a cave and need to get out before fainting, use Dig to move instantly to the entrance.
 You'll need Dig in order to release these three rare, powerful Pokemon. You must use Dig by the Braille Tablet found in an underwater cavern off of Route 134.
