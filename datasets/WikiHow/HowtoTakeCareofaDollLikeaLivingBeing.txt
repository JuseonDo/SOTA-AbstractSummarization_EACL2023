 You can make your own or buy some doll clothes if you'd like.;
, Alternatively, use real ones; choose the very smallest ones.
, Make it from a shoe box or similar small box. Line with a piece of foam. Add a blanket, sheet and pillow.


A pillow and sleeping mat can be made from scrap fabric. Cut two pieces of fabric into a rectangle shape and stitch up three sides. Stuff, then stitch up the final side.
, Pretend you are feeding the "child." Mix a bit of cornflour with water (1/4 cornflour, 3/4 water) and add a few drops of your choice food coloring.


Do not place fake food inside the doll; it might go moldy and ruin the doll.
 You can check out How to Make a Bottle for a Stuffed Animal or Baby Doll.
 Unless you must go to school or any place where you really shouldn't bring the doll.
 If it were a real child, there's a very good chance somebody might call the police.
 You have to pay a lot of attention to the "child." Take the baby for a stroll and if you want, you can be fancy and buy real baby stuff.
 Play hide and seek, card games and ball games.
