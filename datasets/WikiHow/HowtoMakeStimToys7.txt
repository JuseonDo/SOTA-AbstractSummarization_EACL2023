 You will need a large sealable plastic bag, hair gel, duct tape, and other desired accessories such as small toys, craft pom-pom balls, glitter, and/or marbles.
 Be sure that the bag isn't too full, however, since you don't want the bag to break.
, Close the bag and firmly duct tape all the sides of the bag to keep the gel from spilling out. You may want to put the plastic bag inside another plastic bag, if possible, in case the first plastic bag leaks.
 To stim with your toy, squish the gel pad and feel the texture with your hands.
