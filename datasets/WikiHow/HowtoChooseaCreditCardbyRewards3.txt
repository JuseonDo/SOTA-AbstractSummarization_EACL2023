 If you cannot find one, make sure that any fee you pay is lower than the amount of rewards you will garner every year.
 If your credit card has a high interest rate, you may end up paying more than your rewards are worth. However, if you can afford to pay your credit card balance in full every month, the interest rate may not be an important factor for you.
 If you spend more than you normally would just to get points, the card will not benefit you financially.
