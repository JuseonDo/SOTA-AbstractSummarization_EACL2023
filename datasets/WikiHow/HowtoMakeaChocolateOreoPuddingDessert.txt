 Pick out a clean mixing bowl and a medium-sized spatula. If you want to use a metal whisk, that's fine - it can make the Oreos and pudding come out smoother after mixing.
 Either prepare the chocolate pudding according to the package's directions, or take out the pudding packs and pour them into the mixing bowl., Crumble the Oreos the best you can and sprinkle them into the bowl with the pudding., Do this for about 30 seconds to one minute, but no longer than one minute., Add the vanilla or caramel swirl syrup into the glass. Swirl the syrup around the edges of the glass to make a pretty design before the pudding is poured in the glass.

To prevent any messes or smears, try placing the dessert glasses in the freezer for five minutes to make the swirls stick. It makes the glass stay cold for a cool treat, too.
 Now that the dessert glass is cold, you can pour the pudding mix into the glass. Pour it slowly - and not up to the rim., Use a spray can of whipped cream or a container of Cool Whip to top your dessert with whipped cream., Enjoy!
