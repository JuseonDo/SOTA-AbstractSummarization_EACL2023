 Once you launch the application, you should see a list of suggested nearby places you can check into.;
, Tap any of the places displayed on the screen to open the place’s summary page and start checking in. If you want to find a specific spot, type the name of the place you have in mind on the search bar at the top of the screen and press “Done” or “Enter” from the keyboard to start searching. Tap the name of the place you want from the search result list to open its summary page.


Tap the “Check in Here” button you see on the summary page. This will open the Check In screen where you can customize your status before you post it on Foursquare.
 Start typing the name of the friend you want to tag. As you type the name of your friend, a list of suggestions will appear right below the Shout Out text box.
 It will be automatically added to the text box.
 If your Foursquare friend is also your friend on other social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter, you can also share your status post to these sites, and your friend will be tagged there as well.


To do this, tap the Facebook and Twitter icon you see right below the Shout Out text box to enable posting of your Foursquare status on these sites.
 You’ll find this button at the bottom of the screen. This will post your location status to Foursquare. The friends you tagged will also be notified on their devices once you’ve posted the status.
