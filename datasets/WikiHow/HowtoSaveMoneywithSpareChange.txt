@summary
collect as much spare change you can find around your house, pockets, couch, etc.

@summary
set up a time frame of how long you want to keep doing this for.

@summary
during whatever amount of period you decided to do this, make sure you don't touch any of it besides putting it into the jar.

@summary
finally, a month had gone by.

@summary
consider putting your spare change into a bank account.

 It doesn't really matter which kinds you use, just as long as you can use it well.;
, Then put all of it into the jar you had selected.
 Ideal time frame should be AT LEAST 1 month. To make it clearer, lets just say you started doing this in June, that means if you use a 1 month time frame, you should start counting how much you have in July.
 After the time period had gone by, you should start counting how much you have in the jar. If there's efficient enough of spare change in there, you should start rolling them up with some coin wrappers.
 By this point, collecting all the change you could get, go to any good dollar stores around your neighborhood and start buying things with your spare change. You'll be surprised on just how much you could buy with it.
 Some banks does accept spare change and if yours does, then consider putting it in the bank account. It can help you gain more interests so it's a good idea to do so.
