@summary
start off by building your sandcastle.

@summary
start trimming the surfboard (to speed it up, push your hips forward and place more weight on the front leg, to slow it down, move your hips to the back and place more weight on the back leg).

@summary
to change the angle of the surfboard you will need to link your upper and lower body and connect with your surfboard.

@summary
while trimming the surfboard, shift your weight to the back leg, with your arms out rotate the upper body to your forehand or frontside and at the same time shove your front hip across in the same direction, bringing the surfboard with your body and changing the angle it is facing.

@summary
remember that the angle of the surfboard should change approximately between 10 and 45 degrees.

@summary
start off in waist deep water and surf white water (broken) waves.

@summary
shift your weight.

@summary
transfer your weight onto the front leg after attempting the change of angle.
@article
 Pack it down nice and firm and place your surfboard on it. Step on to the board leading your back foot, trim the board and hold the correct surfing stance with the surfboard balanced on the sandcastle.
 Remember your surfing style and always keep your head up, looking forward, back straight and knees bent.
 The following is an explanation of how it can work.
 (The frontside for a natural foot surfer is to the right and for a goofy foot surfer is to the left.).
 Immediately after changing the angle, you should shift your weight to the front leg as to accelerate the board and keep surfing the wave. But now you would be cutting across the wave in a new direction.
 Remember your wave catching skills, jump or step up cleanly to your feet and start to trim the surfboard and surf the wave towards the beach.;
, When you feel you have control of the surfboard and are comfortably surfing the wave, shift your weight to the back leg, rotate your upper body, shove your hips and attempt to change the angle the surfboard is facing, transfer your weight on to the front leg and accelerate across the wave in the new direction and continue to trim the board.
 This will allow you to continue surfing and you could attempt another change of angle on the same wave.
