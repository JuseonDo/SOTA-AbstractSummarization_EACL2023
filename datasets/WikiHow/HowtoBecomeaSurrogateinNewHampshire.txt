 You must be at least 21 years old and have previously had a child to become a surrogate mother.;
, You can match with intended parents through a surrogacy agency or independently. Most surrogate mothers assisting friends or family members choose to proceed independently. Agencies can provide valuable services both during the process of matching with a couple you don't already know as well as during the journey itself. Each arrangement is unique, take time to be sure you have gotten to know your Intended Parents if you are going the independent route, likewise, take time to get to know your agency if you are working through a mediator of some sort.
 This medical evaluation will typically be done by the reproductive endocrinologist ("RE") who is overseeing the IVF procedures.
 At some IVF clinics, this consultation will be done on-site on the same day you have your physical evaluation. Otherwise, you can meet with an independent mental health counselor.
 You and your spouse/partner will have your own attorney who can help you understand the contract and negotiate for terms that are appropriate for your situation. Your compensation schedule will be written into the contract.
 You will have a pregnancy tests within a couple of weeks of the IVF procedure to determine whether or not you are pregnant. After follow up ultrasounds show that everything is on track, you will be released to your OB for prenatal care.
 During the pregnancy is often the best time to get the parentage order issued by the court. This order will ensure that only the intended parents' names go on the birth certificate. Either your attorney or the intended parents' attorney can handle this legal piece of the process.
 The agency (or one of the attorneys) will coordinate with the hospital ahead of the birth to make sure everything goes smoothly.
 Finally, the big day is here. The intended parents will assume all responsibility for the baby immediately upon birth.
