 (In some countries, such as Australia, bike helmets are required by law.) You can find a stylish, lightweight one for about $40. Don't buy a helmet at a big-box or department store. This is your head/brain protection! Get an inexpensive one from a bike store.;
, Use bright clothing by day, lights and reflectors by night.
, Try to "spin" by pedaling in a circular motion at a minimum of 60-80 revolutions per minute. This will build good form and help protect your knees from injury. It also promotes a great cardiovascular workout.
 If you ride several times per week, your body will soon become accustomed to riding and you'll be able to ride further, faster, and more comfortably.
