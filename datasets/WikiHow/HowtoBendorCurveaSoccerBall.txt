 Curving a soccer ball is actually a lot harder to do than you might think. This will require plenty of ongoing practice, preferably with friends or other team players.
,, If you want it to swerve to the right, kick the ball on the left side and vice versa for swerving it to the left. It is much easier to start out with curving the ball to the left.
 Aim for a bottom-right panel on the ball. Place your planting foot (left foot if you kick with right, and vice versa) at a 45 degree angle towards the ball. Take your footwear off and look at your foot. Feel the inside of your shooting foot. Feel just below the end of your big toe bone. Now move another 3⁄4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) towards your ankle. This is where you should make contact with the ball. When you actually kick, your kicking foot should wrapped around to the left side of your body (for righties).


Hit the ball with the inside of your foot. When smacking the ball with the inside of the foot, be sure to follow through with your foot.
