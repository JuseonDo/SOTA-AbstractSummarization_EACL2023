A pivot table will allow you to create visual reports of the data from a spreadsheet. You can perform calculations without having to input any formulas or copy any cells. In order to create a pivot table, you will need a spreadsheet with a lot of data.;
,






Your spreadsheet should include at least one column with duplicate values. This basically just means that at least one column should have repeating data. Also, It should include numerical information. This is what will be compared and totaled in the table.



By default, Excel will select all of the data on the spreadsheet. You can highlight (click and drag) to choose the specific data in which you wish to include.







Click the Insert tab at the top of the Excel window. Click the pivot table button on the far left.



By default, Excel will place the table on a new worksheet. You can switch back and forth from the spreadsheet and the pivot tables by using the tabs at the bottom of the page.



Click into the pivot table anywhere, and on the right had side; a list of the columns will be displayed. Check each box you wish to include in the pivot.







After all the needed information is put into the pivot, the order can be changed by clicking the column heading and dragging it to the desired spot.


Every column will have subtotals in each row of data. Unless this is correct, right click the column in which there are unwanted subtotals. After you right click in the column, unselect subtotals.



Repeat the previous process in a separate Excel document using the alternate data. Make sure to order the data the exact same way as the first document.



Copy and paste both pivot tables onto the document. Make sure they are in the same order so they line up properly.


Look for mistakes in alignment, and make sure everything is matched up to what it is supposed to be.


Now is time to see how the data compares. The differences are easily seen in the totals of each table.
