, Get the balloon and stretch it out as much as possible using your hands to make it easier to inflate. ,, Stir it around with a straw until the baking soda dissolves into the water.,, You will notice that your balloon will start to inflate. When you add the lemon juice to the baking soda it creates a chemical reaction. The baking soda is known a a a base, while the lemon juice is an acid. when the two combine together they create carbon dioxide (CO2). The gas rises escapes through the bottle, but doesn't escape the balloon, so it pushes it outwards and blows the balloon up.
