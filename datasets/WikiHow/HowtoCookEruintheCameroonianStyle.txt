 You can also boil cod fish if it is too strong. Boil with a bit of water, about 3 cups, depending on the quantity of meat. Make sure it's ready and soft.
 Put it in a colander to drain, then wash the sliced water leaf or spinach also, and drain., When the kidney meat and cow skin are ready, together with the cod fish, add the water leaf or spinach and leave for a few minutes., Then add the eru while stirring. Be aware that this process is very delicate because you need to make sure you don't put in more eru than the water leaf or spinach can take., Leave for a while to cook. Beware: don't cover the pot. Make sure to remove all the bones in the fish before putting it in the pot., You could add the chilli pepper but this is optional. In just a few minutes, your eru is ready., It can be served with pounded fufu, water fufu, garri, in short anything fufu made from cassava. Enjoy!
