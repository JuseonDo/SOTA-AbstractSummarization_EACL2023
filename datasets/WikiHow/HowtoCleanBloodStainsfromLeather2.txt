@article
 Mix together room temperature water with a few drops of mild soap or dish detergent. Stir the solution until suds are formed.
 Use a clean washcloth or sponge and dip it into the soap solution. Squeeze the sponge so that it is damp, but not dripping wet., Gently blot the stain with the soapy sponge or cloth. Do not rub the stain because this can actually push the stain further into the leather or spread the stain to a larger surface area., Then, wet a new cloth with water and dab the stain to remove any excess soap that may be left on the leather., Use a dry washcloth or towel to blot the cleaned area until the surface is dry.
