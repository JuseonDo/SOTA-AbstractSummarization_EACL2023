@summary
sitting neck exercises - move your neck forward and backward, side to side, twisting and diagonally.

@summary
anterior neck exercise - lying in bed flat and without a pillow, twist your head from side to side at least 15 times.

@summary
posterior neck exercise - while sitting in a chair, clasp your fingers behind your head and "lean" your head gently back, into your clasped hand, for ten seconds.

@summary
build up repetitions and resistance over a long period of time.

@summary
within a workout session and especially with the posterior neck exercise, build up resistance.
@article
 Do this once a week or two, but regularly. If you are upright, these exercises will not strengthen your neck muscles much. You could tense your neck muscles while do these exercises and have a strengthening effect.;
, Lift your head an inch up when doing this. This exercise can be done at the edge of the bed and with your head in line with your body. For a change in routine, do the isometric version which has no head movement, merely lift your head up an inch when horizontal for 20 seconds or so. Doing this exercise with movement, besides using a little more muscle, measures effort by repetitions. When twisting your head, turning to the left then right would be a repetition, and as suggested do this fro 15 repetitions. Tilting your head can be done as well.
 Throughout this exercise, your head and body should be still. Repeat for another count of ten seconds. The posterior neck muscles are strong relative to the anterior neck muscles so the resistance from the body at the horizontal position whether lying or bending over is not enough, so this is where isometric resistance is useful.
 Add just one repetition at each workout. Isometric resistance is harder to gauge, still, work up to putting resistance on your posterior neck muscles within the workout and over a period of months (a year).
 If doing two sets of 10 seconds, make the first set at light resistance and the second set at medium resistance.
