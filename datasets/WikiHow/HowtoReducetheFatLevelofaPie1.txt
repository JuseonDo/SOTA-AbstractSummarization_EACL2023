 This pastry is very low in fat compared to other pastry types.;
, Instead of brushing each layer with oil, only brush with milk (dairy or soy). If wished, you can brush the top layer with olive oil to assist browning and crunchiness.
 The beauty of this solution is that it still works for either a savoury or a sweet pie.
 Keep an eye on the pastry, however, to make sure that it is not browning too quickly. Reduce the oven temperature slightly if this happens.
