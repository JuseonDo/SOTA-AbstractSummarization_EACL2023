 You will end up with a long, skinny rectangle. You can use any color you want. If you don't have any construction paper, you can use printer paper instead.;
, Do not tape the top and bottom openings shut, however. These will make pockets for your thumb and fingers to go into.
 The open ends should be at the bottom of the rectangle. The folded part should be at the top.
 Start with the side that is facing you. Once you have it folded up, flip the paper over, and fold the other side. You will end up with something that looks like an W or zigzag when you turn the paper sideways.
 The two folded edges should be facing you. They will make the mouth. The two open edges should be facing away from you. They will make the top of the puppet's head. This is important. If the folded paper is not facing the right way, your puppet may end up upside down.
 Add some eyes in the middle of the paper, and a nose towards the bottom. Don't worry about the mouth just yet. You can draw the eyes and nose using crayons or markers.


To make a fancier puppet, glue on some buttons or googly eyes for the eyes.
To make a silly puppet, glue on a pompom for the nose.
If you glued anything on, make sure you let the glue dry before you move on to the next step.
 If you'd like, you can even add a tongue and some teeth.
 Turn the puppet so that the two openings are facing you. Slip your fingers into the top opening, where the eyes and nose are. Slip your thumb into the bottom opening. Move your fingers and thumb towards/away from each other to make the puppet talk.
