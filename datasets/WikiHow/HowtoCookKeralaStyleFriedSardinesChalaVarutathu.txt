 Slide in the opposite direction of the fish scales.;
, Make an incision to clean out the inner parts and threads; these are easily removed by using your fingers.
 Add some crystal salt and lime juice. Rub the fish along with the pan. This will help to minimize the bad odour.
 Make 2 to 3 gashes on each side. Drain the water and keep it aside.
 Grind until it forms a fine paste. Apply the paste to the gashes made in the fish and to the stomach area. Refrigerate it for 10 to 20 minutes.
 Tilt to spread the oil uniformly across the pan base and sides.
 Shallow fry the fish. You can cover it with a lid to prevent the spluttering from escaping.
 Remove from the flame or heat when it's crispy.
