 Knowing the different maps inside and out can really help if you're playing modes other than team deathmatch.
 Knowing the maps can help you get kills by always knowing where the enemies are spawning.
 Another example where map knowledge can help is the mode Hardpoint; knowing where the next hardpoint is allows you to rotate early and get the points, and get a jump on enemies trying to get in that might not know you're there.
