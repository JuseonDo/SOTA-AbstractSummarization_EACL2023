 A formal letter will include a formal greeting such as "Dear Mr. Jones" or "Dear Miss Jones." If you are writing a casual letter, you can dispense with the formal greeting.


Choose the title of "Ms." if you are writing to a woman and you do not know if she is married or not, or if you know that she prefers that title.
, This is more appropriate than "To Whom It May Concern." You also do not want to assume it is a man by writing, "Dear Sir."
