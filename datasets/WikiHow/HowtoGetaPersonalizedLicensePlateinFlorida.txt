Florida plates with a centered logo, like the traditional plate and many specialty plates, can fit up to seven characters (letters or numbers) plus a space or hyphen. The tags with a left-sided logo can accommodate five characters only. A personalized tag for a motorcycle can fit up to six characters only.;
, You need to have several backup numbers listed in case your first or second choices are already taken, even if you have looked them up online. This application is available at your tag office or online.
 There is a $15 fee in addition to the normal fee for a new license plate. The manufacturer has 45 days to create and deliver the plate after they receive the order, so it can take a couple of months before you receive your new personalized tag.
