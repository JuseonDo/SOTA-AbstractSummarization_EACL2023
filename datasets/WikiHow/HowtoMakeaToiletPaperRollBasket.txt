 You can make two baskets if you like from this, as you'll only need one half for a basket.
 Cut out the circle and tape it over the opening to cover it. This will be your bottom of the basket.,, Be sure to measure it so that the two holes will be equal in height and directly across from each other., Join the ends of the pipe cleaner to create a handle for the basket., If you're using it for Easter, add some paper shreds for grass or cut out a heart for a Valentine's Day basket.
