@summary
go and get your notebook/piece of paper and pen.

@summary
open up a microsoft word document (or something similar) on your computer.

@summary
staple it together.

@summary
if you don't have time to make the recipe book or don't have a printer you can buy one but a homemade one feels likeÂ you put more work into the kit.

@summary
remember to check the word document for typos before printing!

@article
 Go through your recipe books and the internet and look for the best baking recipes you can find.
 Type or copy and paste all the recipes in. Add a Table of Contents at the beginning and a title page. Remember to make it colourful and easy to read. Save the file and print it. Do not put in any recipes the recipient of the basket will/may be allergic to.
 However, if it is too thick to staple get a hole punch and punch a hole 1/4 of the way up and another 3/4 of the way up (the page). Get some sting/ribbon/colourful wool and tie a bow through the first hole. Repeat for the second hole. You can do this with as many holes as you want. Remember to tie the bow tightly and double knot the bow tightly.
 If you don't have a printer you can ask a neighour/relation/friend to print it for you or go to a printing store (although you will have to pay for the last option).
