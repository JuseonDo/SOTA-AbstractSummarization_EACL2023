,, In PowerPoint 2003, click the Slide Transition menu item under the Slide Show menu.



The most basic transitions include unfolding from the bottom, top or either side; appearing with a pixelated effect; fading in from either a white or black background.
More advanced slide transition types are also listed, such as a wiping animation from one side to the other, a wheel animation and bar transitions.
,


PowerPoint has an array of sample sounds from which you can choose, or you can use your own sound file with a .wav extension.



If choosing an automatic transition, be sure to set the number of seconds your slide will be visible before it begins to change.
,, Otherwise, select the next slide in the left pane and repeat the steps to set a new transition scheme.
