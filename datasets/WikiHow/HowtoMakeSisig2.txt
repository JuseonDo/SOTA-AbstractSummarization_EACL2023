 Remove your meat from the refrigerator and chop it into pieces roughly 1-2 centimeters across.


For smaller, finer sisig you can use a food processor, pulsing the meat for 2-3 seconds at a time.
 Cook these together for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 Stir the mixture to coat everything in butter, then cook for another 1-2 minutes.
 While the meat is already cooked, this marinates the meat in the sisig and brings the whole dish together.
 Add the liquid ingredients and stir them in to coat the rest of the ingredients.


Remember, if you don't have calamansi you can substitute the juice from a lemon or lime.
 Since the meat is already cooked, this is just to mix the flavors together and reheat the pork.
 Sisig is often served with an egg on top, or alongside a side of rice. Enjoy your dish!
