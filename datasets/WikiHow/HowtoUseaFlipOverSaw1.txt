@summary
choose a suitable site to work from: flat, level and free from loose materials, debris or rubble.

@summary
,check that the flip over saw is firm and does not move.

@summary
route the power cable to the flip over saw away from the work area and not suspended off the ground in any way to cause a trip hazard.

@summary
gather together your personal protection equipment (ppe), which should at least comprise of suitable safety glasses and a good push stick if using the flip over saw in table cutting mode.

@summary
wear stout, steel toe capped boots, sensible clothes and tuck away anything loose that could be pulled into the blade.

@summary
keep your material stock sited to hand and safely stacked.

@summary
site the saw so that you don’t have to walk around it to take the freshly cut workpiece back to the work place and then stack the materials to the left hand side for convenience.

@summary
use some kind of side supports, if cutting lengths longer than say 1 meter (3.3 ft).

@summary
plan your work so that you minimize the amount of times that you need to ‘flip’ the saw over into table mode and back, if you can.

Your power supply should be from a safe point with enough capacity for the start up surge of a powerful motor, often around 2000w. This supply should have some kind of circuit protection preferably a sensitive breaker that will trip in the even of an accident. If using a 110v transformer, site this next to the power point and use a suitable 110v extension lead to the flip over saw. DO NOT run a 240v extension lead to the 110v transformer at the saw!, Ear defenders are a good idea if in an enclosed space or if using the saw for extended periods and absolutely essential if cutting aluminum (special blade required) (as the noise from these blades can be horrendous!) If not using a dust extraction system then dust nuisance face masks should also be considered especially if ripping down long lengths of material or working in an enclosed space., Wearing rings and other jewellery is not to be recommended either. Hard hats are needed if there is a danger from above or if passing long lengths of timber overhead., Removing a single length should not cause the stack to collapse!, This leaves a clear route between the flip over saw and the workplace. Being efficient means getting more work done for less effort!, Either commercial saw supports or custom altered ‘saw horses’. Try using metal folding type saw horses with a timber packing piece screwed to the tops. Three is ideal, two to the left and one to the right to catch the off cut. Two to the left is needed as the material may get smaller and smaller if cutting several sections out of one length. This is essential for safe working and to prevent the blade snatching the workpiece as it cuts through., For example: do all of the table saw cuts first and then switch to your miter saw cuts. This is not always feasible or practical though and fortunately most flip over saws are quick to change over.
