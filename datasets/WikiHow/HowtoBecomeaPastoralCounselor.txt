 Pastoral counselors know in their heart they are called. If you have doubt, be sure to resolve it. Speak with a counselor yourself.;
, There are several institutions devoted to the education of pastoral counselors. The National Christian Counselors Association , Pastoral Counseling Center and the American Association of Christian Counselorsare three useful sources of further information.
 Communicate with those that you feel attracted to. Remember, learning to become a counselor requires interaction with others. Becoming a useful counselor does not come simply from reading materials, but also from human interaction and practice. Be sure your educators are reachable and involved. An education can be done online and through the mail as well as by attendance in person.
,, If necessary, you could start your own church, but there are several already dedicated to serving pastoral counselors.
 Progressive counselors are using video telephony when geographical restraints preclude face to face interaction.
 If you are properly trained and certified, there are several agencies that will provide insurance coverage.
 Get business cards, tell your friends and acquaintances what you are doing. Advertise. Volunteer to gain a reputation

, As you build a satisfied clientele, you will create word of mouth advertising that will augment your other efforts.
