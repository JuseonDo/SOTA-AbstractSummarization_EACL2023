 Start the engine and remove the cover from the steering column. Remove the fuel pump relay fuse under the dash near the steering column. The female clip of the relay is yellow, but the rest of the relay is dark. The engine will stall and depressurize the fuel line to prevent gasoline from spraying when you disconnect the filter., The negative terminal is black, printed with the letters "NEG" and marked by a minus (-) sign., Locate the fuel filter toward the middle, in front of the rear passenger-side wheel, toward the center of the car., Use a cross-tip screwdriver to remove them part way, then gently pull them out. Note the position of the cover so you can easily reattach it.

Place a pan under the filter to catch fuel.
