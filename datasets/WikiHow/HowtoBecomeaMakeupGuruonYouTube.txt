 Try watching a variety of videos so you can have an idea of how it would be like, and what role models to look up to. Examples of makeup gurus on YouTube are jlovesmac1, MichellePhan, xteeener, kandeejohnson, teenbeauty channel and bubzbeauty.;
, The trick to becoming a makeup guru is to take note of what your viewers want and to use innovative techniques.
 MAC and Maybelline are good examples. Don't be afraid to try new types of makeup or techniques that you find interesting. Drugstore products also interest younger viewers as they are more affordable.
 Most of the girls that watch how-to's on makeup are in the age range of early teen years to late twenties. Try to make videos that will interest this age group.
 The best area to film is in a small room; you get better sound quality. Make sure that you have a camera with nice quality. A tripod that you can set up easily would also be beneficial.
 Put music in the background and edit them very well before posting. Be "real" with your viewers, and relate to them. Humor may be used at appropriate times.
, Be your unique self!
