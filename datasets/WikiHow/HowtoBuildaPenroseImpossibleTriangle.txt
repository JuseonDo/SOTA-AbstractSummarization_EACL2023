@article
 Each 8” long x 2” wide x ½” thick. Note that the size can be scaled up or down.;
, Use wood glue and clamps to apply pressure.
 Note that these bolts are just used to give the illusion that the wood is connected.
 Other options include adding a center axle under the bottom to allow it to spin or placing holes in the bottom side and providing a matching plate with dowel pins. The second option would allow you to reposition the triangle in the exact same spot (relative to camera or person) which would be nice for video.
 A Canon DSLR camera was used for the photo and video. It took a few minutes on a tripod to line up the angles.
 This step is optional.
