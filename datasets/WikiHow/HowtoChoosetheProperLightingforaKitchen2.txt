 Ambient lighting is powerful enough to create a diffused light that reaches into spaces like cabinets, the refrigerator or the kitchen table.
 Large fixtures can be made with iron, plastic, ceramics, glass and antlers and more.
 Unless you plan to recess a large fixture, you will want to be assured of the lighting quality and aesthetic look before buying.
