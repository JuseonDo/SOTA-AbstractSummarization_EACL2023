 You'll want to boost your drive, or gain. Pick slides are improved by a distorted tone;
, These strings are the lowest and usually will produce a thicker tone than the high treble strings.
 It should make that 'screech' sound.
 Slide your left hand towards the nut and bring your right hand back to it's normal position.
 Once you get the sound, keep practicing your pick slide until you think it's perfect. You can change it for song appropriation. Be it a fast slide for an up-pace song or a long drawn out one for a heavier tune, the pick slide is a diverse technique with many applications.
