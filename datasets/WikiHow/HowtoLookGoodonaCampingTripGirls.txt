 Avoid loops and fuzzy outerwear that can catch easily on leaves and branches.

Check weather reports to be sure the clothes you are bringing are appropriate for the conditions.



 


Put on a nice T-shirt, sweater and pair of jeans or sweatpants that you won't care about if they get dirty. It's best to wear quick-drying, easily washable clothing.;
, That's one less thing to worry about. Leave the scented body lotions, perfumes and related products off your body, as they'll only attract biting insects.

Deodorant is fine, and be sure to pack some to take with you.






Understand that it may not be possible to wash your hair while camping. There might not be proper facilities for that, so just wear a pretty bandanna, braid your hair, or tie it back with a ribbon.






If you think that you cannot go without washing your hair, use dry shampoo or cornstarch (just sprinkle onto hair and comb out extremely thoroughly).
 If it's long, tie it back into a ponytail using an elastic. Throw a few spare elastics in for the camping trip, as you'll be best off tying back your hair every day., Dry your hair lightly, and try to style it by pushing it up with one hand as you comb it with the other.
 It will be helpful to bring along pre-moistened, unscented cleaning towelettes.This will help to freshen up when it is not possible to bathe. Make sure you choose the unscented so as not to attract the wildlife.
 Put in some leave-in conditioner but not too much. Brush your hair and, if you can, look into a mirror or phone camera while doing this to make sure you like your hair., Get dressed and add some bug repellent., Hold with an elastic. Use bobby pins to keep the hair off your face., A good attitude and feelings of happiness will help you to look your best while camping.
