 This is mandatory, your phone will be blanked completely during the process, also don't bother backing up anything on your memory card as you can just take it out of the phone instead, also take out your SIM if you have anything saved on it. You can backup your BlackBerry using BlackBerry Desktop Manager.;
, If the version you want to downgrade to is not installed, you will need to download it from here. Once downloaded, install.
 To do so, download and install JL_CMDER from here. Once installed turn off your phone, plug it into your computer, close BlackBerry Desktop Software and open JL_CMDER and choose Wipe. Then do as instructed.
 Open Windows Explorer and go to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Research In Motion\AppLoader\ and open the Loader.exe file. Then follow the prompts on the screen.
 Again just follow the steps on how to restore you device on the prompts. And after restoring your phone, don't forget to insert your SIM and memory card.
