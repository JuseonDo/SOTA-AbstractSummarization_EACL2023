 Getting your haircut is a nice change and will make you feel better .;
, Some parents are more strict about what their children wear to school than others. Girls, don't forget to ask about wearing makeup if you want to wear it.
 Make sure you do this sometime near the end of the summer because you grow a lot during this time.
 Grammar and spelling are really important for seventh grade.
 This is an important step because you're going to need safe places in your room to keep your homework and your files.
 You don't have to read very often, but make sure you do it. It will keep your brain sharp and make you a better reader.
 Don't forget pencils, erasers, binders, rulers, pens, and paper, among other things.
 Some good places to do so are online and at your local library.
