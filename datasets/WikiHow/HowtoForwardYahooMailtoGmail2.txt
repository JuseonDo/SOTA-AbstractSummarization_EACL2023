 You can configure Gmail to load your Yahoo messages so that you don't have to log into Yahoo mail at all. This method may be useful if you can't get forwarding to work properly.


If the Inbox website opens instead of the Gmail website, click the "Gmail" link in the Inbox menu.
 This will open the Gmail settings page.
 You can adjust your account settings here.
, You can add up to five different email accounts.
 This will allow Gmail to retrieve your Yahoo mail.
 This will automatically file your incoming Yahoo messages into a separate label. You can leave the other settings at their default.
 If you enable this, you'll be able to select your Yahoo address as the sending address when composing a new message.


If you opt to be able to send messages with the Yahoo account, you'll be asked to verify that you own it by clicking a verification link.
 Your messages will be filed into a label with your Yahoo address. This will allow you to easily find your new messages. Gmail will automatically retrieve your Yahoo messages at regular intervals.


With the default settings, retrieved messages will be deleted from Yahoo's servers once they are transferred to Gmail.
