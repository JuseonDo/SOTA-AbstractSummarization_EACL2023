The international exit code may change, depending on where you're calling from. Mexico and most European countries, for example, use 00 as an exit code instead of 011.;

The country code to access Egypt stays the same, no matter where you're calling from.



Area codes for international numbers are often written as part of the number itself or separated only by a hyphen, instead of separated by parentheses as is common with United States numbers.
Unlike United States mobile numbers, Egyptian mobile phones are all assigned the same prefix. If the leading digit for the "area code" you dial is 1, you're dialing an Egyptian mobile number.
