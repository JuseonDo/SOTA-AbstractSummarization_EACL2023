 Place suitable potting mix with vermiculite and perlite in a small plastic pot.


Buy a commercially-sold potting mix that already contains these soil conditioners or use peat and add them to it. If you choose to use peat rather than potting soil, you can purchase vermiculite and perlite at most garden centers.;
,,


Locate a healthy, mature leaf that is growing close to the base of the plant. Use a sharp, clean knife to make a clean cut with minimal damage to the host plant.
Cut off the leaf stem with your knife. The cutting needs to be about 1-1.5 inches (2.54 cm to 3.5cm), so if it exceeds that length, cut it down as much as necessary.
,


Make a small hole in the damp potting mix.
Plant the leaf in firmly and only cover the stem that has been covered with rooting hormone.
, However, make sure that this light is not direct. If you have fluorescent lights, you can also use those rather than putting it outside.
 Allow the soil to dry out slightly.


Use tepid (not hot!) water as African violets don't like cold water.
 However, in many cases you should see shoots appearing within two weeks.


During this time, uncover the plant every now and then to make sure it is not drying out. If it appears dry at any point, add just enough water to get the soil damp. Let the water drain off, and then put it back in the bag.
If you notice at any point that the interior of the bag has become wet with humidity, take the bag off long enough for the plant to dry.
 Some of the soil should come up with it. You do not want to tear it from its roots.
 You will not be able to grow African Violets without any roots, so be sure they all have some of the leaf stem's roots.
,


This shouldn't take any longer than 2 weeks; exactly when you remove the bag is a matter of your own discretion.
If you think the African Violets look sturdy enough to handle normal weather conditions, they are probably ready.
