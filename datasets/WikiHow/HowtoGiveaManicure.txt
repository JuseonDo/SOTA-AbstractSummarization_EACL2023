,,, Or try to create your own exfoliator using sugar (not salt, as it can burn cuts), a few drops of liquid soap, and an oil like lavender (it's a relaxing scent).
,,, Don’t use the metal ones and definitely don’t cut the cuticle. This can cause infections. Make sure all equipment is thoroughly washed and sterilized.
,, Almond oil, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil are the best.

, Put the small bowl of oil in a larger bowl filled with hot water. This will warm the oil evenly and keep it from becoming too hot.
 Use nail polish remover to remove any nail polish on the nail. Be gentle to avoid harming yourself or the person.
 Be sure to file only in one direction so that you don't break the nail.
 Place a small amount on each nail and massage it in, moving down away from the nail and back up.
 Massage it into the skin for a minute. To remove, use a hot towel or mitts.
 Take the small bowl out of the large bowl place both hands, fingertips first, into the oil bowl. Soak for one to three minutes.
 Use a cuticle knife and very gently in circular movements go around the cuticles to lift them up.
 Be very gently, as doing this too hard can be painful.
 Use a warm, damp towel to remove any excess oil on the hands.
 This will help soothe any tense muscles.
 Paint the nails with the desired color.


To polish, start off with a base coat to prevent staining and wait to dry. Then, apply your chosen polish (keeping in mind that some nail varnishes may need a second coat). Finally, apply a top coat to avoid chipping of the nail varnish and to give the final look a shine.
