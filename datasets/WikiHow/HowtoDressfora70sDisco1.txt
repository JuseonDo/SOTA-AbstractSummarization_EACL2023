 Look for metallic colors or bold prints like leopard, and search for fabrics like spandex or satin.;
,, The sleeves should flair out toward the wrist. Many disco jackets were also made of satin, since this material reflects light well. A polyester suit jacket in white or a bright pastel would also work, however.
 The pants should match the color and material of your suit jacket.


If you do not wear a suit jacket, pick out a pair of satin bell-bottom pants with a bold, metallic color.
Make sure that the pants are fitted at the waist and flare out from the knee down to the ankle.
 These are a necessity for the 70’s disco look.
 The medallion itself should rest on the part of your chest exposed by your unbuttoned shirt.
