 Prepare two sponge baking pans measuring 20cm round. Grease the sides and line the base with baking/parchment paper. Cover a wire baking rack with parchment paper.
 Add the butter, vanilla extract and sugar to the mixing bowl. Beat until the mixture becomes fluffy and light.
 Beat them into the mixture. Then beat in the milk.
 Stir in each batch of flour thoroughly.
 Divide the batter evenly.
 Bake for 30 minutes.
 Tip the two halves out onto the wire rack to cool. Turn them over to have the top side facing upward before leaving to cool.
 Spread the jam over the top of one half once cooled. Place the other half onto the jam covering to sandwich the two together.


If you like, whipped cream can also be piped on top of the jam.
 If wished, you can dust with icing sugar to complete the look. Cut into slices for serving.
