The fermenting bucket should have a lid with a hole and grommet for an airlock. It should also have a spigot near the bottom.;
,, Make sure they are completely submerged. If your fermenter has a lid and an airlock, make sure they are in there. Leave all of the tools in the fermenter for at least 30 minutes.,, All counter tops should be washed well with soap and water, then rinsed with Clorox® and water to sanitize. Clorox® and water in a spray bottle will do a good job., All of the tools must be rinsed very well, then lay them out on the clean work surface. Drain some of the sanitizing water through the spigot to sanitize the spigot. Empty the fermenting bucket and rinse well., Bring it back to a boil, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Add the Vanilla Extract to the sugar water.,,, (2 Gallons of water + 7 Lbs of ice = 11½ Quarts.),,, Soak all of the bottle caps and the tubing for at least 30 minutes. Then rinse well., Bring the water to a boil. This makes the sugar easier for the yeast to eat. Dissolve the sugar in the water. Measure out 1 tablespoon into each bottle. This is called Bottle Priming., Place it on an elevated surface, like a counter-top. Hook up the tubing to the spigot., Clip the tubing so that it reaches the bottom of all the bottles, with a little bit to spare., When you pull the tubing out you should have just about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the neck-ring of the bottle. The neck-ring is just below the cap., 14 would be better. If you sanitized right, the beer will continue to condition, age, for about 4 months. A good rule is to keep the fermenting for 2 weeks. Then bottle the brew, and let it carbonate for 2 weeks, and let it condition for 2 weeks. The 2 week conditioning is usually 10 days at room temperature, and 4 days in the refrigerator.
