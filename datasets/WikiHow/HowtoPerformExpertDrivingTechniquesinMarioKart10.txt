fire-hopping is another "pro" technique, allowing you to go faster than ever to achieve impossible time records that may seem only possible for hackers to pull off.

while you drift and then start snaking, let go of the stick and the drift button instead of just letting go of the drift button.

congratulations!

 You basically start by drifting and slowly descend into snaking, but instead of snaking completely, you must do some "adjustments" to do fire-hopping instead., Now, you must immediately press the drift button and tilt the control stick again within under a second. Instead of tilting the stick in the opposite direction, you must tilt in the exact same direction as before., You have just done fire-hopping. To know and verify that you have done this technique, your vehicle should have been drifting, and then suddenly boosting while you are in the middle of a drift, and then drifting again. If you still do not understand, it's snaking but never changing the direction of the drift to go faster while drifting.
