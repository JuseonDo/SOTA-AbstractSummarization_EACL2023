 It should be a size in proportion to the doll.;
, This isn't essential, but it might make the board more fun to play with. You could use markers and draw patterns on it, or write the doll's name or the doll's place of work.
 This will now hold the sheets of paper or lists that the doll needs to read or write on.
 Perhaps slide on a list of "to-dos", a shopping list or a checklist for an audit in the doll's workplace. All done.
