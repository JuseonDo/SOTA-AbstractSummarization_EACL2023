 Cut a length of fringe that measures 4 times the width of the fabric.
 Lay the fringe along the edges of the fabric square. The fringe should face into the center of fabric.
 Set the second piece of fabric on top of the first, right-side facing down, and pin together.
 Leave a 5-inch (12.7 cm) gap so you can stuff the pillow. Clip the corners of the throw pillow, then turn it right-side out. Stuff the decorative throw pillow with the batting, and hand sew the gap closed.
