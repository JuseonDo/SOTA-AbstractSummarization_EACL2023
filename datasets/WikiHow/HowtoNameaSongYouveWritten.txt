take a look at what you've written.

@summary
think hard: would it make sense to take a line from the chorus and use it as the title, or does the song deserve something more creative?,

@summary
find the proper wording for this emotion.

@summary
once you settle on a phrase or word that perfectly describes everything you, the narrator of the song and the listener would experience through the song, you have your title.

,

@summary
also think about what made you write the song in the first place.

@summary
lastly, see if there is a specific recipient to which you want to dedicate the song.
@article
 Without having a general overview of what you have really done, you can't hope to synopsize it properly with a title.;
, Think about what the song is saying from the perspective of the narrator, or what a listener would say the song is about. Try to draw a connection to both the narrator and listener: a common emotion that both may experience.
 Sometimes, this is best to sleep on for a night or two.
, If the source of your creation is an object or even a person, you can't be wrong to include references to the object or person in the name.
 You should think about what the person would like and what kind of feelings or thoughts would the name you have come up with stir up in their mind. In that way the name does not necessarily have to connect to the content very closely.
