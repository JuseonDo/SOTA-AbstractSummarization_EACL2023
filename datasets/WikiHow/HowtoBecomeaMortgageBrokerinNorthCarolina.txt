North Carolina law states that North Carolina lenders, originators and mortgage brokers must be licensed.
In some cases, banks and credit unions can be exempt from licensing since they are overseen by the Federal Reserve and the National Credit Union Administration.
You do not have to be licensed as a mortgage broker if you are already licensed as a North Carolina lender of mortgages.;

A mortgage broker is defined by North Carolina law as a person that will receive compensation from working with North Carolina mortgages.
