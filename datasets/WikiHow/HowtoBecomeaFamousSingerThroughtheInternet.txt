 Are you a soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, or bass? How large is your vocal range? How much lung power do you have?;
,,,, Upload the recordings of you singing onto SoundCloud. Upload the videos of you singing onto YouTube.
 This may take some time, but if singing is made for you, it's not impossible.
,, For starters, try a website like Weebly. That is a website that you can make websites on.
 Along with the songs, write the lyrics, the name of the song, who it's by, and, if you wrote it, what it's about.
 Write about your family, what you like, what celebrities you like, what movies/books/shows you like, etc

, This should include your email, YouTube username, and SoundCloud username for now.
 Collect friends on these sites and refer them to your website. Make sure to add your networking usernames to your "contact me" page on your website.
 Use Tumblr to write and post about the things you like. Make sure to upload your videos and recordings to your blog. Also be sure to add your username to your "contact me" page on your website.
