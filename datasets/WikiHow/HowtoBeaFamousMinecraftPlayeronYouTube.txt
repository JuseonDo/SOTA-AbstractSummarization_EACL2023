@summary
try to advertise, you can advertise in chat when you play, sometimes famous youtubers will subscribe to you if you say a lot of good stuff in your vids and they watch it, (it works, you just have to comment on them a lot and they will check your youtube, dun dun dun, guess who probably just got a famous sub!)
@article
 You won't be known if you don't have a YouTube account! Also, try to make a username on YouTube that is similar to your Minecraft game tag and try to take a picture of of you in your Minecraft skin and make it your user photo. (Change your skin if you have a lame one!);
, Just like IHasCupquake does with her Minecraft Oasis series! Make the first video interesting, and try to make the audience wonder what will happen next.
 Ask them to give you a suggestion what type of Minecraft gameplay would they'd like to watch next, and what mods they would like to add in it.
 Also try talking about something interesting that is happening in your life. Don't brag about everything you tell the audience, or they'll think you're selfish and vain! Don't swear a lot, that makes the audience think you are a VERY dirty YouTuber.
 Don't try so hard on being popular on YouTube, that'll make you lie a lot about your life! Like how SkyDoesMinecraft is funny on YouTube. He gets popular 40% because of that!

, Every body likes a YouTuber who has an amazing voice and creations! Try also to make that parody funny and creative so more people will subscribe to you.
