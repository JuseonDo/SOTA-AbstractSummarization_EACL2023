 Note the line of where the rope will run.






;
, Buy a single rope that equals that length, rather than splicing several shorter ropes together.
 Space them every 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm).









Nail the clips in only half the length of the nails. This will give you space to slide the rope lighting in under the clips.
 You will be able to slip some ropes up into the clips, while other arrangements will require you to slide through the open arch of the clips like a snake. In either case, slide the rope through all the clips before proceeding.
, It's usually better to use an extension cord to reach the outlet, rather than running the rope lighting itself to the outlet.
 Less expensive models lack a switch, so you'll need to plug and unplug the rope -- or plug it into an outlet attached to a light switch.
