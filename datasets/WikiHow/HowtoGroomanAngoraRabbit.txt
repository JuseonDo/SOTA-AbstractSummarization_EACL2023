 Write down each grooming date so that you know when the next time is.;
, Clip them if necessary.
 When you do the belly and legs, put the rabbit on its back in your lap. Use a towel to create a "hammock" to make your rabbit more relaxed. If you use a grooming table, put a non-skid surface, for instance a carpet, on it.
,,,, You can use a cat brush with bristles.
 Pull it apart with your fingers. Then comb out the mat. If your rabbit is severely matted, work with the mats an hour a day. Just make sure you don't tire your rabbit too much. You need to use clippers if your rabbit has a lot of mats. Don't clip more than 20 minutes. Then let your rabbit rest for 10 minutes before you move on. Look for any sign of stress in the rabbit. If your rabbit is stressed, stop and continue the next day. If the rabbit has a mat very close to the skin, let it outgrow so it can be removed with safety.
