 To kill any gnats (along with their eggs and larvae) living inside your drain, simply pour a small dose of ammonia into the sink. This will effectively remove all traces of the gnats. Just be sure to leave the ammonia to dilute for several hours before using the sink again, as ammonia is also toxic to humans.


As an alternative to the foul-smelling ammonia, you can put a couple of tablespoons of baking soda into the drain, followed by a cup of white vinegar. The mixture will fizz slightly, then should be left to sit for a couple of hours before running water.;
,, While this may catch some of the gnats that hang around the drain or garbage disposal, it is not worth the trouble of a clogged drain.
