 The first step in collecting a urine sample from a horse is to make sure you have all the necessary equipment before collecting it.;
, Gloves are optional and a good whistle.
 You may need to grab it quickly for a collection.
 Take it to its water and splash water on its mouth. Rub it around its eyes. This works in a similar way to a dripping tap.
 As you are walking, whistle. The whistle will sound like a strong wind blowing through a crack in a window, the high pitch but breezy sound. This may take a few minutes or it may take an hour; patience is essential! A well trained horse will urinate on cue to the whistle, so you are trying to teach it to associate the whistle with urinating.
 Eventually, your horse will urinate. This is when you need to be quite fast.
 When the horse has finished, make sure that it doesn't spill it over by turning the horse around on its haunches or pivoting on its hind legs.
, They may think it's attractive enough to drink. Put a small amount in a urine collection jar (from the vet's) or into a small jam/baby glass jar. The jar must be sterile, clean and have a lid. The container should be quite full, but not quite to brim.
 If it has to wait a bit before you take it to the vet, label it "Do Not Drink" in case you have a less than astute fridge user. Throw any excess away.
