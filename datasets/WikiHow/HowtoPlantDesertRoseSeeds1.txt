 Fresh seeds are likely to produce, but dried seeds have a low success rate.


Alternatively, you can obtain fresh seeds from a garden supply store or other reputable dealer.;
, If the seed pods open, the seeds will disperse, and you will not be able to use them to grow a new plant.
 They must be allowed to mature before removal; otherwise, the seeds may not be developed enough to grow. When the seed pods try to open, they are mature and ready for removal. Clip them off with a sharp knife or pair of scissors.
 Allow them to dry.
 Each pod should contain multiple "feathery" seeds.
