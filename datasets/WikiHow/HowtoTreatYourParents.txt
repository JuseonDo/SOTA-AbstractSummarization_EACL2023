 You can't compare anybody to them. Yes, on days you may feel like saying "I wish my mum had Angelina Jolie's lips," but you don't really mean it, even if you think you do. Parents are the people you should love a lot in your life.;
, A nice, simple greeting like "Hello," "Hi," or "Good morning," will brighten their day. You don't have to say "Salutations, paternal and maternal units," and even though this may make them laugh, deep down they just yearn for an "I love you" from you.
 Keep that in mind and you'll love them even more.
 If they are feeling sick, make them some chicken soup and give them a box of tissues, and if they're feeling stressed, give them a massage and chat to them about the good things in their life.
 Call them up at work to say hello and check how they're doing. Parents love nothing more than talking to you.
 Invite them to plays, talk to them about parent/teacher conferences, you can even help mum join the PTA in your school.
 Keep a love meter to tell them how much you love them. On their bedroom table, have a piece of paper and a meter, and color it in a little more each day, until it's full. Then write "I love you so much, it can't fit on this paper.
