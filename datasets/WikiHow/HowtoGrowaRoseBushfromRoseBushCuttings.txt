 If you use a pot, fill about halfway up with soil and add enough water to moisten it. If planting it in the ground, dig a hole, add potting soil (for extra nutrients) and moisten.;
, It can be a whole branch or a stem.


With your knife, gently scrape off 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the outer covering of the clipping at the bottom. This will allow the rooting hormone to get into the stem.
 Tap it a few times to remove the excess.
 If everything goes right, it should start to put out roots within the next week or so!
