 Stop flirting with him. Be more distant. Don't make eye contact or smile. Turn your head and don't let him kiss you when he tries. This includes not standing next to him. As tempting as it is don't text him even when you're bored;
,,, Be clear to the guy that you are not interested in him, you are interested in whomever you are flirting with. Do not do this if he's a friend. It will really hurt him. It's better, in that case, to tell him straight out.
 This could be one of your other friends, or if you have a new boyfriend, you could get him to tell the guy that you don't like him anymore if you are comfortable with doing this.
