 Use paper towels as substrate so you can see if the snake has mites. This way, this helps your collection no get infested if the new snake has mites. If this is your first snake, of course you can just put it in your designated snake room., Research them all. After all, using a product once a month is easier than going through trying to rid an entire collection of mites.
