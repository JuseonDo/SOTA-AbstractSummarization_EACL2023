 Use a large, non-aluminum stock pot to combine your ingredients.
 If possible, find a burner that doesn’t need to be cleaned. If all need cleaning, leave one burner to be cleaned last. You will need to boil the water and washing soda for this project.
 You want the water to come to a rolling boil so have patience. Check water or stay nearby to avoid having the water overflow onto the stove.
 You can reduce the heat to a simmer while the burners are in the water but check to make sure the debris is lifting while they are “cooking.”

, Rinse burners with cool water and inspect them. Make sure all of the food has been removed or can easily be wiped off.


If you still have stubborn build up or grease, fire up the stock pot and bring to a boil. Add the burner to the boiling water and boil for another few minutes. Remove and inspect. Repeat as necessary.
 You never want to reconnect wet burners with a stove--you could become injured.
