find a noun that has to do with your site.

put those two words together.

feel free to change a few letters or add some words.
@article
 Try to make it something unusual and interesting. For example, if you had an art site, your noun could be "canvas". But if you had a computer site, your noun could be "circuit board".
 Using the latter example above, your adjective could be "electronic" or some other more interesting adjective.
 Our circuit board example gives us "The Electronic Circuit Board".
 Our Circuit Board example result is too general. We can change it to "The Electrifying Circuit Board" to make it more interesting, and sometimes humorous.
