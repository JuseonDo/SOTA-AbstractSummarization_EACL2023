, Bring rune armor (or dragon hide armor), and lobsters. Remember, they are level 82.


Bring a lobster pot. This is optional, requires level 40 fishing. Since the demons are in Karamja, why not catch another inventory of lobsters and cook them after you've eaten them all?

, The demons are located deep inside the cave below the Karamja Volcano. Open the wall after you get to a wall.
 Remember to eat your lobsters.
