,

@summary
split the piece into five strands.

@summary
make one normal five-strand braid stitch.

@summary
now, you're going to go back to the strand closest to your face and repeat, but you're going to add some loose hair that's not a strand to this strand.

@summary
continue doing these crossing movements until you run out of hair to add.

@summary
so now your braid looks cool, but it could use some more wow factor, right?,

@summary
if you want to, pull out some little hairs to frame your face.

, To keep it in place, use two bobby pins and put them in an "X" shape on the hair at the nape of your neck.
, Use both of your hands for complete control.
 To do this, cross the strand closest to your face under the next strand and over the middle strand. Then, take the strand furthest from your face and cross it under the strand next to it and over the middle strand. This is one normal stitch of a five-strand braid.
 Cross it under its neighbor and over the middle strand. Repeat this with the other side. Make sure to add loose hair on that side too.
 This means that all your hair is to the side and incorporated into the braid. You can either put it into a side pony or continue by braiding a normal five-strand braid (as instructed above) to the bottom of your hair. Tie off with an elastic.
 The trick to making the Dutch five-strand look beautiful is to gently tug on the outer edges of the braid. This fluffs out the braid and makes your hair look much thicker. This technique is known as "pancaking" the braid. Do this along both edges all the way down the braid.
 Add a blast of hairspray if desired. Now you're done!
