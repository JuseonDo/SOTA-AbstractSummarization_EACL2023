 paper.;
,,, To do that, take on line side of the line you cut, and overlap the other side to get your desirable cone shape.
 Set the cone-hat aside til' later.
 Use your imagination to create your own symbol to put your Hokage hat! Or you could just copy the Leaf Village one, for example, if you are cos-playing Tsunade or Sarutobi. I made my own, for Keiichi (in my made up series =D)

,,,, You have to cut out where you outlined the symbol on the tracing paper. Now. Line up the black paper inside the outline you made on the tracing paper (sorry if this is hard to follow...)

, On two opposite sides, cut a tiny hole to stick your string through. Now go back to your symbol.
 And staple those to the front of your cone-hat.
 Just measure the circumference of your head. Leave some extra to tie off the ends.
 Tie knots on each end. At least 3 on each end. If that manages to get through, then staple it to the original cone-hat.
 Cut 2 equal strips of it. Staple these to somewhere in between where you put your symbol and your strings.
