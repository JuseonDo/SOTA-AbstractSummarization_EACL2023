determine what is needed.

if the person only needs ventilations, blow every 5 seconds.

@summary
if the person needs both treatments, blow 2 times (each breath for 2 seconds)while holding nose shut, then follow up the rib cage and find the top of the rib cage and place down two fingers and start your compressions.
@article
 If there is no breathing and no pulse, start chest compressions. If there is a pulse but no breathing, just give ventilation. A person will always have a pulse if he or she is breathing, but one can have a pulse and not be breathing.
 After 2 minutes, check for breathing. If there is no breathing, continue breathing treatment (rescue breathing). If there is breathing, put the patient in the recovery position.
 30 times and continue until you have completed 5 cycles. cycles (2 min) then check for breathing and pulse. No breathing and no pulse?...Continue. Breathing and pulse...recovery. Pulse no breathing...rescue breaths.
