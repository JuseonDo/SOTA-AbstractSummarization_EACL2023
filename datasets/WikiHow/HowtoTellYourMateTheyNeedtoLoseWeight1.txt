;
, Do research on healthy, balanced dietor exercise programsand ask if your friend will join you in trying to follow the new plan. Frame the discussion as if your mate will be the one helping you stick to a commitment to be healthier, instead of the other way around.
 If you feel comfortable gently and directly addressing the matter, privately ask if he or she has thought about trying to lose weight.


If your friend is already trying, offer your support and encouragement.
If your mate is offended at the idea or sees no reason to lose weight, consider discussing your concerns about his or her health or drop the matter for a month or two to give the idea time to take hold in his or her head. Chances are, your mate is privately aware of his or her need to lose weight and is simply embarrassed to discuss the matter or to realize that someone else is concerned enough to mention it directly.
