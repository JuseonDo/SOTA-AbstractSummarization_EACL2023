 The flesh can range in color from a pale pink to a deep red, depending on the salmon species available. A salmon fillet is cut in half lengthwise down the middle of the fish. The pink flesh is exposed on one side, and the skin (typically scaled) on the opposite side.


Depending on your location and the time of year, you may find Atlantic, Coho, Chinook, Sockeye, and King, wild, farmed, fresh, or frozen. Each option features subtle differences in taste, texture, and appearance.;
, Cooking fish with the skin-side down helps retain its moisture during the cooking process. This is especially important when baking salmon, as it tends to dry out easily.
 The right temperature depends on the recipe used and the size of the fillet being baked. Set the oven to the lower end of the temperature range for smaller fillets and the higher end for larger fillets. Cooking the fish at too high or too low of a temperature will dry it out.
 Keep the fish covered during the process, as it helps the fish retain its moisture and speeds up the cooking time.
 A small fillet may only require 25 to 30 minutes, while a large fillet could take 40 to 60 minutes to bake.
 A meat thermometer can be purchased at most grocery or kitchen stores, and it takes the guesswork out of baking salmon. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the fillet and remove the salmon from the oven when the temperature reaches 140ºF/60ºC.
