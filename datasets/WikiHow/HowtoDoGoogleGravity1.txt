 For this method you will need to use a browser that doesn’t have Google instant results.


If you attempt the trick and Google populates results when you type “Google Gravity” in the search bar, you will need to turn off the instant results feature. Sign into your Google account, and then type google.com/preferences into your address bar. Under “Google Instant Predictions” choose the option to “Never Show Instant Results.” Save the changes at the bottom of the page. ;
, This will take you to Google’s main search engine.
,, Try this as a trick on friends or family that aren’t Internet savvy. They may believe they broke Google’s website.
 You can throw them around the page. You can also pick up the Google logo and swing it around in a circle.
 Use it as you normally would.
