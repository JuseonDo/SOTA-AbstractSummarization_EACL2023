, Apply toward the inside of the eye lid rather than the outside., Apply with blending eye shadow brush from the end of the gold sparkle to the edge of the outside of your eye lid., Here you are going to use your blending brush again and apply the darkest layer to the last three-quarters of your eyelid, blending the lighter sparkle with your dark sparkle., This look can even work without liner if you really wanted., Your look is finished!
