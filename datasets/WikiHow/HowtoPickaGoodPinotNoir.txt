 A smarter bet would be from California or Oregon. The best Pinot Noir regions in California are: Carneros (Napa and Sonoma), Santa Lucia Highlands (Monterey), Santa Rita Hills (Santa Barbara), Sonoma Coast and the Russian River Valley (Sonoma). The best Pinot Noir regions in Oregon are the Dundee Hills and the Willamette Valley.;
, Central Otaga region in NZ is a good region for this variety

, If the alcohol level is above 14.5 percent, the grapes were probably picked when they were overripe. This can be devastating for the flavor profile, creating and unbalanced wine. Good Pinot Noirs are known for their balance, so watch out for the alcohol percentage.
 You may not be able to afford every wine you want.[[Image:Pick a Good Pinot Noir Step 4.jpg}}
