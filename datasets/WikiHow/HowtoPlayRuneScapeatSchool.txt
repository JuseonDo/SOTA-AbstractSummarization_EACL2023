 If your school computer isn't advanced enough, open two windows instead. Better yet (but more annoying) bookmark a certain page (on frogs or something) and keep bookmarks open. When your teacher comes around open it. This is possible because RuneScape saves as you go.;
, If you don't have a RuneScape account, it is best to wait until you get home to create the account.
 The video below also shows how to use a proxy to play RuneScape at school.
 Use standard detail. This will make the computer run as fast as normal, and will make things less suspicious.
