@summary
the proper way to open a jump ring is to twist the wire until the required opening is achieved.

@summary
do not pull it open.

@summary
use two pairs of flat nose pliers.

@summary
grasp the jump ring on opposite sides using the flat nose pliers.

@summary
use a "twisting" motion only to open the jump ring.

@summary
you should now have the jump ring open.

, this does several very bad things: weakens and distorts the metal, creates an unappealing rump ring shape and makes it impossible to close the jump ring correctly.
 These will allow for a firm grasp of the wire and also prevents slipping and marring (distortion or marking).
 First, try holding onto the jump ring with one pair of pliers. While continuing to grasp the jump ring firmly in one hand, pick up your second pair of pliers with the other hand and grasp the other side of the jump ring.
 Basically, one hand should rotate towards you and the other will rotate away from you. It may take a little practice to get used to holding onto both pair of pliers, but it's worth the effort, and requires much less work in the future.
 To close it, use the same steps as above. You may have to work around any item you have now added to the jump ring but the same technique applies.
