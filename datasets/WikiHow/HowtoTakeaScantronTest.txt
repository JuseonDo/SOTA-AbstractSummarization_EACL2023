 Since a Scantron test will be multiple-choice, read Take Multiple Choice Tests for advice on how to study for multiple-choice questions.;
, You can buy them at your school's bookstore (if there's one), or online somewhere such as Amazon.
 At the very least, you'll need #2 pencils, and if you're asked to buy your own ones, your Scantron sheets. You'll also want to bring a pencil sharpener in case your pencil(s) break.
 The sheet will have an area where you can put in this information.
 If you need to change an answer, erase the bubble completely and bubble in another answer.
 This will let you make sure your answers are correct, and change any answers if you think you answered incorrectly.
