Change your passwords periodically. Also, to avoid phishing attempts, don't click on any link that doesn't begin with "http://" or "https://". An exception to this rule is any website you know you can trust.
 Delete any infected files. Do not ignore warnings provided by your antivirus software.
 Don't "friend" anyone you're unsure of or haven't been in contact with for a long time.

 Don't share personal information, passwords or security questions/answers with anyone you're not positive about.
