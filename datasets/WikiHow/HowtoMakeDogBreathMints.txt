 You'll need enough to stick to the mint. Don't use too many crackers or this will over-power the effect of the mint.
,,,,, Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.;
, Blend in a mixer on low speed for about 30 seconds.
 This should be done one cup at a time. Increase the mixer speed to medium as you add the flour.
 Use the station to knead the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin. Use a cookie cutter to cut out each biscuit. Place the raw biscuits on the cookie sheet.
 Then turn the oven off. However, leave the biscuits inside for another 1-2 hours so that they get crispy.
 Then, they're ready to give to your dog! These cookies should last for about a month if they are kept in a dry, airtight container.
