 With Sims, not every attempt results in pregnancy. But when your dog becomes pregnant, you get an on-screen message informing you. Another way to tell is if when pregnant, the interaction 'Try for baby' will not appear until after the dog has had her litters.;
, The pups will have some traits and markings from their parents or grandparents. They might also exhibit other random traits and markings. Puppies might even inherit the ability to do some tricks, if their parents or grandparents know some.
 To do so, click on the puppies and click the name pet interaction.
, This results in the positive puppies moodlet.
