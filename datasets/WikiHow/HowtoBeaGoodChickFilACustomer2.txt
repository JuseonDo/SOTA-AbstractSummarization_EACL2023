,,,, The whole point of drive-thru is to serve customers as quickly as possible.
 The headsets used do not have exceptional sound quality. If you mumble or slur, chances are you'll have to repeat yourself. If you drive a truck with a diesel engine, make sure to turn it off before they speak on the headset. It is almost impossible to hear you speak otherwise.
 The person at the window handles the sauces. On the other hand, it is sometimes preferred that you ask for sauces at the speakers so that you don't hold the line up.
, "A lot" changes from person to person. This helps you get exactly what you want while also cuts down on product waste.
 You may love condiments, but it took the employee time to stock the drive-thru sauces.
 It takes 10 minutes minimum to make a tray, so you'll have to park anyway. Unless you car has really comfortable seats, or a large TV, you'd probably be more comfortable inside. Plus, you would hold up the drive-thru line.
 Instead of just saying "I'll have a number 5 (nugget combo)", specify whether you'd like 8 or 12, and what type of drink you would like. Either way, they're gonna need to know. For milkshakes, please specify large or small. There is no size that is "regular or medium" for milkshakes. Don't forget to add if you would like (or not like) a cherry and/or whipped cream.Â :)

, This step prevents the hassle of refunding or charging you the extra amount of money. They do this to make sure that you are getting exactly what you wanted.
 So a nice customer with smile on their face is always a refreshing site to see.
 This can result in your order always missing something...
