 We've heard horror stories about rates in excess of $1/min (USD) and phone bills of $1,000/mo (USD) and more, especially from soldiers stationed overseas.
, Most companies utilize a simple drop down rate finder tool allowing you to easily select where you are calling to so you can view their rates.
 Look for fees, calling restrictions, convenience features, and respected brands.
 For example, look for seals or badges the Chamber of Commerce or the Better Business Bureau. Look for a guarantee, secure shopping, company contact information, and the like.
, Since email is so heavily scrutinized these days (by spam software), be sure to check your Spam/Bulk/Junk email folder for an email receipt from your phone card company, as it will include your PIN and dialing instructions.
