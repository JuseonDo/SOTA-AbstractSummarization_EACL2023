 It may seem like a silly step, but if you do this first, it will save you time later and help you get everything done much more quickly. Because everything you need will be in one place, you don't need to waste time rummaging through cupboards.;
, Rinse them well and place them into the food processor.
 Do this using your measuring spoons. Then, add the ingredients to the food processor.
 Add these to the food processor as well.


It's okay to measure out a little extra peanut butter. It sticks to the measuring cup and sometimes it's hard to get it all out.
 You should have roughly the same texture as regular cookie dough when you're done.
,, Then, place the mixture in the fridge and allow it to cool down for at least a half an hour.


Often, the processor heats up and makes the dough warm, and it's much easier to make into balls for cookies when it's chilled.
If you want to stop here, this makes a great edible cookie dough dip that is also gluten free!

Make sure you check the oven to see if anyone else has left anything inside.
 Spray a nonstick cooking spray on them. Another option would be to grab parchment paper, cut it to the length of your baking sheet, and lay it on the top of the sheet.
, Keep repeating until you run out of space on the tray or dough.


Some people like to use an ice cream scoop so that every dollop is perfectly uniform. If this creates your desired cookie size, then feel free to try that.
 Carefully place the tray(s) on one of the inside racks.



Make sure you wear oven mitts to pull the trays out.



Be careful when moving the cookies. They may be hot enough to burn your skin, and sometimes they will fall apart.
If you don't have cooling racks, take the cookies out five or so minutes early and allow them to cool while on the baking sheet.

Be careful of this strategy! If you let the cookies bake the full 20-30 minutes, they will keep cooking while the tray is heated and may burn.
 Then, transfer them to a plate and enjoy!
