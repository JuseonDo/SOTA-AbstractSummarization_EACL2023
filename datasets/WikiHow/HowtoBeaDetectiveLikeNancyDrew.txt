, Always keep it clean so you can find things easily in your time of need.
 Don't wear something like a leather jacket (makes too much noise), flip flops (makes running difficult) and jeans (brushes and makes noise when walking or running). These kinds of clothes give yourself away very easily. Try to wear matching clothes so you look sophisticated. Sporty clothes are good for running and don't make much noise.
 There is always something interesting happening. Never let anything out of your sight. Nancy Drew saw everything very quickly and you have to do the same in order to be like her ( remember everything is some kind of evidence, not all in the same case though!).
 This will help you in difficulties like Nancy Drew overcame.
 Double check!
