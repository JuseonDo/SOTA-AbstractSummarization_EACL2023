 Fill the detergent dispenser with 3/4 cup (177.44 ml) of vinegar or until the detergent dispenser is filled. The detergent dispenser is usually labeled and can be found on the top of your front load washing machine. Once it's filled, close the lid., If your front load washing machine doesn't have a hot water setting, select the "whites" setting or "stain" setting. Allow the cycle to run through completely. , As the normal cycle runs, mix Â½ cup (90 g) of baking soda and 1 quart (1 liter) of white vinegar in a bucket. Once the ingredients are incorporated, use the solution to dampen a rag and use the rag to wipe down the exterior of the washer., Run a rinse cycle with no added vinegar or detergent. This should remove the smell of vinegar and help remove any remaining dirt. Once you're done, the washer should be good to use.
