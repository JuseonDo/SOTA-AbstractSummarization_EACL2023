 Though no certification is required to start your own silk screen t-shirt business, it's helpful to learn from professionals how to use the equipment and achieve the best printing results.;
,, For example, some silk screen t-shirt businesses sell t-shirts with their own designs, while others sell t-shirts with prints of tourist attractions, and yet others sell custom-made t-shirts to order. Finding your niche will help you set your products apart from the competition.
 Calculate your investment and projected income, and describe your method of operation, target market, and advertising plan.
, If you're planning to hire employees, you'll need to apply for an employer's identification number (EIN) in order to pay their salaries. If you'll sell t-shirts along with your printing services, you'll need a vendor's license, which can be obtained from the chamber of commerce in most countries.
 Make sure it's large enough to fit your equipment and has good ventilation. If possible, choose a location on a relatively busy street for greater visibility and to attract more customers.
 You'll need a screen exposure unit, color station printer, flash cure unit, conveyor dryer, inks, squeegee blades, and blank t-shirts. Many silk screen supply shops offer this equipment as packages, which can be cheaper than buying each piece of equipment separately.
