make sure the gas tank on the trimmer is full before assuming it's not working properly.

,

@summary
check the rim below the point of the spark plug for build-up of carbon deposits, and the point as well.

@summary
first make sure you are well clear of any gas and then heat the spark plug rim with a butane lighter.

pull the rope again with choke off a few times and the engine should start.

@summary
if it still does not start, it could be the carb is gunked with deposits, in which you will need at this point, some carb cleaner.

 Do a quick check to satisfy yourself.
, The rim should be silver and not black, and the point should not have build-up on it either. If the rim needs to be cleaned, scrape off the deposits with steel wool or a use small flat head screwdriver. Be careful not to break the white ceramic insulator.,,,, It should rev up a little then stop cause choke is still on.,

If the engine does not start, replace the spark plug with a new one, as this could be the problem. (The old spark plug has a number on it, so write it down before going to the store).
, To clean the carb, remove the carb cover and spray off the jets, making sure that they are clean and unobstructed.

Then take off the primer cap from the line and spray carb cleaner down the tube where the cap was attached and replace the primer.
Press a few times, forcing the carb cleaner in the line into the carb.
Repeat this process a few times.
 This is a screen that prevents hot particles from escaping the muffler, which can cause a fire. If it is blocked, remove it and scrape with a wire brush or a piece of wood, then replace it., Also note whether after you have put a few drops of gas in the cylinder, and replaced the spark plug, it fires up for a little but does not run. If so, this could mean the carb is blocked, because gas is not getting from the carb to the cylinder, and the only thing that's making it run for a bit, is the little gas you put in the cylinder. If it does not run at all, it is usually because the spark plug is either spent or dirty., Press primer bulb a few times forcing excess gas in line to run into carb, and then pull starter rope a few times forcing all the gas out. Excess gas sitting in the line and in carb over the winter causes blockage, so always empty and clean when not in use for extended periods.
