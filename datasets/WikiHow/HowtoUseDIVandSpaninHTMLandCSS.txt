@article
 It basically contains body inside HTML.;
, You must remember that div is a container tag so it must have a </div> after it, like <div> </div>


<div> is used to make divisions on the page, so you can even use div tags inside a <div>.



You can use # for making an ID for your <div> or just simply write div and set its height, width, etc. But when you have many divs, its better to use an ID.
 The span tag is generally used to select a part of line and apply some properties to it. However you can use it for selecting more than a single line.
 You can have multiple spans in a line.
