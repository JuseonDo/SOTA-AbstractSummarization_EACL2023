 You will need a Phillips head screwdriver to do this correctly.
 Two go in the actual Furby's compartment, and the other two go inside the compartment in the battery door., To do this, hold down Furby's tongue switch. As you do this, use something small, such as a pen, to press down the reset button on the bottom of your Furby. After you do this, close the battery door. If your Furby wasn't new in box, than there is no need to do this., Make sure the screw isn't too tight, as it could become stripped.,
