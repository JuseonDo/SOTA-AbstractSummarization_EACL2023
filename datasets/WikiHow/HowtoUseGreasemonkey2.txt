Visit www.userscripts.org, a web repository that contains thousands of custom scripts that can be used with Greasemonkey.
 For example, if you would like to find ways to improve your Facebook browsing experience, type "Facebook" into the search box to see a list of all Greasemonkey scripts that affect Facebook.
 This is good if you don't have a specific script in mind and just want to see what's out there.
 The tags in the list will be different sizes based on their popularity: the larger the text, the more popular the category. This is a good way to see what's popular right now.
