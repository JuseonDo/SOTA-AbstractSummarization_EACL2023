 When rinsing the shell, run your finger around the inside of the shell to get rid of any residue. Try to leave the membrane. Most of the nutrients are in this.


Save the yolks and whites for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
 You can use your hands, a coffee grinder, or even a food processor. Crushing the eggshells will make it easier to measure them out.
 This will be enough to brew 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of eggshell tea.


Consider adding 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of Epsom salt for extra nutrition.Epsom salt is high in magnesium and sulfate, both of which are beneficial to plants., You need 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water for every 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of crushed eggshells.Boiling the water will give the eggshells a "jump start" and help them to start releasing their nutrients into the water faster.
 During this time, the eggshells will release their nutrients into the water.
 This will allow the water reach outdoor temperatures, and lessen the risk of "shocking" the plants by being too hot or too cold. Some gardens find that this also helps the plants absorb the nutrients better.When leaving the jar outside, make sure that it is covered, and in a shady spot, out of sunlight.
 For best results, use the eggshell tea once a month.The water will be infused with calcium and other nutrients, and give your plants a growing boost. Store any leftover water in a cool, dry place.
