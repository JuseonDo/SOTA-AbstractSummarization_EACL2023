first, you must love doritos®.

@summary
plan the ad beforehand, possibly adding a script if anyone says anything.

@summary
think of something clever for the ad.

@summary
don't do the ad all by yourself!,

@summary
once you've practiced, and practiced, and practiced some more, do the actual ad.

@summary
edit the footage after you've filmed the whole thing!,

@summary
when they run a request for a new doritos® ad on tv, or if it mentions it on a packet of doritos®, it will have the address to send the footage to.

@summary
you may also get paid.

@article
 Define "Love". You must LOVE Doritos. Otherwise, the ad won't look as effective, and may not be accepted!;
, You must be prepared!

, Come on, think! You could possibly think of something as "Dori. Toes." and eat Doritos® with your feet (Not recommended, unless you shower before each rehearsal of this, which can become a huge drag). Also, make sure you actually eat some Doritos® in the ad!

, Hire at least 2 other people, and maybe a photographer. You need to film the ad!

, Get the photographer to film from different points to keep the ad interesting.
 Upload it to your computer and edit it with text, colours, anything! You could also try adding a voice in the background. This makes the ad more artistic!

, Take the film footage from the camera and send it to the address mentioned on the Doritos® ad request. They will keep the footage.
