 This will leave you with a gap between the beginning of the round of stitches and the end of that round.
 You should make your loop about eight inches long.
 Pull the working end out of the project, leaving one piece of yarn sticking out of the end of your round. You will end up with four or five inches of tail, which is necessary for you to be able to finish the project.
 If you are having a hard time getting the yarn threaded, bend your piece of yarn over and squeeze the bent area as thin as possible with your thumb and forefinger. Push this thin bent area through the head of the needle. It should go through easier than a raggedy end piece.
 In essence, you are connecting the end of your last round to the beginning of your last round by replicating that same type of stitch.
 Point the end of the needle toward the inside of your project and pull the thread through. This should lock the end of your yarn in place for good.









Try to match the tension that you used in the rest of the project, so that the last stitch you just made does not stand out., Make sure that the end is secure before you clip off any extra tail with your scissors. You should now have an invisible bind off on your circular crochet project!
