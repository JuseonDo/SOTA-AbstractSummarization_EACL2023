 Ideally, you have a cage where the rabbit can enter or exit at will. But if you don't, set the rabbit on the floor of an enclosed, rabbit proof area.;
, Rabbits tend to find people much less threatening (and more interesting) when they're down at floor level. Lie down if you can, sit if you can't.
 You can watch a TV show or listen to music, so long as neither one is too loud. Read a book. Do a crossword. Talk to someone you like on the phone. (Make sure the conversation is pleasant and low key.) You can even do homework or pay bills, so long as you're calm and quiet.
, He or she will probably come over to investigate you and may even hop up on you. Don't make physical contact just yet. You can talk to the rabbit in a soft, gentle voice.
 At this point, you can start interacting with your rabbit a little more. Healthy treats are a good way to encourage your rabbit to come and see you. If your rabbit seems particularly comfortable around you, you can try petting him or her. Start by stroking the forehead with just two fingers and see what your rabbit thinks.
, This is quite ordinary and does not mean your rabbit has become shy again.
 Treats usually lure the rabbit, just be silent, patient, and don't move. Make sure the bunny knows it isn't a trap.
