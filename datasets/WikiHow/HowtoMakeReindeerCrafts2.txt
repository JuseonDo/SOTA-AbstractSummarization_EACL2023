 Glue in place.

The bar of the A is supposed to cross over, just ensure the lengths are even on each side. Let dry completely.
 Now you should see the basic reindeer shape of ears sticking up (the legs of the A), antlers sticking sideways (the external cross bars of the A). The tip of the triangle is the reindeer's nose., Use either a red paper or felt circle, or a red pompom., Allow to dry in place., Arrange the three leaves in formation first, then glue the three berries in the middle, where the leaves meet. Allow to dry., Use thin ribbon or wrapping ribbon to make a loop for hanging the decoration from. Either glue in place or wrap around the crossbar neatly., The reindeer decoration is now ready for hanging on the tree, in a window, and so forth.
