 This can be done by using dictionaries, the internet or certain Cornish books. Don't forget that some Cornish people have a certain accent which you could also try to imitate.;
, Bodmin Jail (Gaol), Jamaica Inn and Pengersick Castle are all supposed to be haunted. Cornwall is also very well known for its history.
 Remember to bring a camera so you don't miss the breathtaking views.
, Recently some new flavours have come out. There's "Kernow King" Pasty, which is a very peppery pasty, and there's an extra large pasty which takes up more space than a big plate! If you are going to buy an extra large pasty you're better off eating it with someone.
 Some things to draw would be: Roger Taylor (the drummer in Queen) as he was born here, the Cornish flag, Kernow King, the Beach, a Pasty and much more besides.
 Listen to the sounds of the sea splashing against rocks and the wind whistling in your ears along with seagulls squawking above.
 Invite all your friends, family and anybody else you want to invite to a huge party!

, In years to come you'll look at the photos and remember what a wonderful day you had.
