 You can research images online or teach students a more extensive history of the holiday. The person creating the mask should understand how a skeleton mask is traditionally decorated.;
, You can do an Internet search for Day of the Dead masks, calavera template or calaca template.
, Print it out to use as your pattern.
 You can simply cut around the perimeter or your can cut out the eye, nose and other decorations, so that you can trace them directly onto the paper plate.
 Flip it over, so that the back side of the plate is the front side of the mask.
, If you are using a thin paper plate, you can cut out the mask and eye holes with scissors, and if you are using a thick paper plate, you may want to use an Exacto knife. Your skeleton mask should begin to take shape.
 You can use differently colored paints, permanent markers, colored pencils or crayons. You can choose to have a black and white palette, to further imitate a skeleton, or you can choose to decorate it with bright colors.
 Hearts, flowers, patterns, scroll-like designs and swirls are all common motifs used to make Day of the Dead masks. You may want to do this in pencil first, so that you can plan out the look of the mask.
 You can color in the white paper plate completely, or choose to leave the background white with designs all over the face. Calaveras in the style of Mexican illustrator Jos� Guadalupe Posada are often filled in completely with designs.
 Tie a ribbon, string or chord through each hole, so that you can tie your mask tightly around your head.


Instead of punching holes and attaching chord, you can hold your mask with a stick. Place a paint stirrer or other wooden stick onto the back of the mask. Make sure that it extends about 9 inches (22.9 cm) to 1 foot (0.3 m) below the mask bottom. Tape the stick to the back of the mask.
