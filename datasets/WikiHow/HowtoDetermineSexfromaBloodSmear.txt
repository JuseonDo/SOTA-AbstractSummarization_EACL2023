@summary
scan the blood smear slide under 100x oil immersion on the microscope for polymorphonuclear neutrophils.

@summary
scan the smear in an orderly fashion.

@summary
characterize and record each neutrophil you encounter as one of the following four forms, based the presence and morphology of appendages:

@summary
form a, or "drumsticks", contain stalked, round-headed appendages of chromatin,1.5 μm in diameter, attached to a nucleus lobe with a thin stem.record number of each form as you scan the blood smear, until you reach a total of 200 neutrophils.

@summary
see if there are more form a or form c neutrophils.
@article
 Neutrophils are typically the most abundant white cells in blood and contain 3-5 segmented nuclear lobes in a pink cytoplasm.
 A recommended approach is the "snake-like movement". Begin at the thin end of the smear and count as you move the slide vertically. When near the edges of the smear, move the slide horizontally for a distance of about two fields, then proceed vertically back.,



 








Form B, or "sessile nodules", resemble drumsticks but are devoid of any stem.






Form C contain other pedunculated nuclear projections, such as "clubs" and "hooks", which are easily distinguished from small lobes and forms A and B above.
Form D: Neutrophils without any appendages.
, If there are more As than Cs, the blood is that of a female. Conversely, if there are more Cs than As, the blood is that of a male.
