 Place the pan over medium heat and heat the oil until it begins to shimmer.
 Sauté the onions and carrots, stirring occasionally, until the onions become translucent and the carrots soft. This should take about five minutes.
 If you add the garlic too soon, it will burn; it only needs to cook for a minute once the vegetables have been cooked.
 Once the vegetables are cooked, the rest of the ingredients will be combined in a food processor.
 Be careful, since the contents of the pan will still be piping hot.
 Pour in eggs, yogurt, spices, and bread crumbs.
 Just a few pulses should suffice Take care not to over process the mix, since this will result in a runny batter that will spread instead of holding its shape when you cook it.
 Use a spoon to scoop out the mixture and form it into palm-sized patties with your hands. Each one should be about 1/4 cup.
 Allow the oil to get nice and hot; it's ready when it begins to shimmer., Place the patties in the pan and fry them on each side for two to three minutes, or until the exterior becomes brown and crispy.
 These lentil burgers taste delicious with classic condiments or with a Greek yogurt sauce to contrast with the spices.
