 Put a small pot of water on the stove at a medium heat until it's at a rolling boil.
  Leave it to steep for 30 - 40 minutes or until the water turns a deep amber color.,, You'll want to leave the tea for around 35 mins. Stir it from time to time as needed., You can also use a spoon to pick the cardamon and cloves up if you don't have a sieve., Add milk and sugar as desired.
