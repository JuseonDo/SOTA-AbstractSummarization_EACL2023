 Silently shake your head while mouthing the word no. Watch for them to notice and get the message.
 If you consider the person to be rude or mean-spirited, communicate your disappointment by scoffing, rolling your eyes, or muttering "ugh." This makes your unhappiness clear while keeping their remark beneath you, making them less likely to escalate.
