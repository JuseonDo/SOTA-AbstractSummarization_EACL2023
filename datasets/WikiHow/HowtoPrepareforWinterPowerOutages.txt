How many people will be sheltering in your home during the power outage?
How many pets will you be caring for during the power outage?
Do you have infants?
Does anyone in your household, including pets, take medications?
Does anyone in your household require special medical equipment, such as an oxygen concentrator?
Do you have cold-blooded pets, such as snakes or lizards, that rely on a heat source to survive?
Do you have a heat source that does not require electricity, such as a wood stove?
Do you have an alternative power source, such as a generator?;

If you have a woodstove or fireplace, make sure it is in good working condition. Have the chimney cleaned. Stock up on dry firewood and kindling.
Consider purchasing a portable propane or kerosene heater that is meant for indoor use. Make sure you have plenty of fuel for the heater.
Always use a battery-powered carbon monoxide detector when using an alternative heat source.



You will need about one gallon of water for each adult, child, and pet per day.
Food should not require cooking or refrigeration, and should provide balanced nutrition.
