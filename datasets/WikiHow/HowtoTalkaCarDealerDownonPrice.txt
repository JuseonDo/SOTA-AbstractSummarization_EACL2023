 Find out the Blue Book value of the car you want to buy at www.kbb.com. Also, don't be afraid to check Craigslist and other classifieds to see how much similar cars are going for.;
, Dealers are much more likely to go down in price if you have cash.
 Tell yourself, I will not go over X amount of dollars.
 Play it cool. Say that it's alright, but it's not your favorite car out there. If you keep talking about how much you love that car, or how you've always wanted that type of car, the dealer knows he has you--hook, line, and sinker.
, It at least makes it look like you know what you're doing.
 Whether it be, the brakes feel like they need some work. Or the interior needs a good cleaning, or the car has a few scratches and dings. Use these 'issues' to negotiate price with the dealer.
 A general rule of thumb, is to put your first offer so that your highest price point is at the middle of your offer and the dealer price. For instance, if the dealer wants to sell the car for $3,500: and you don't want to spend more than $3,000--put your first offer in at $2,500. Bring up of the 'issues' you found while looking at the car, and say that's why you want to have your price so low. Bring up the KBB value of the car, and say that you've seen other comparable cars for less (even if you haven't).
 Don't budge too much, but don't low-ball the dealer.
 If the dealer won't meet your price-point, say it's more than you wanted to spend, and that you know you can find a similar car for a better price-- be willing to walk away. Remember, there are always other cars out there. And, sometimes, if the dealer sees that you will walk away, he will match your offer. After all, they love to make their sales.
 Remember the two most important rules: don't get attached to the car, and prepare yourself to walk if the price gets too high.
