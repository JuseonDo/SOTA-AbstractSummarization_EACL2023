 You will need to decide what color paint you want to purchase and what type of paint to purchase. It is usually best to use semi-gloss paint. Most people use the same paint for chair rails that is used around window and door trim. The paint store can help you with how much paint you should buy.;
, This will serve to catch any dust while you are sanding and drips of paint when you are painting.
 If there seems to be a lot of dust on the chair rail, you may want to clean it well before using the sandpaper.
 The painter's tape will allow you to paint a perfectly straight line. You can seal the edges of the painter's tape by going over the tape with a putty knife. You do this to keep paint from getting up under the tape.
 Most paint stores will give you a paint stirrer for this purpose.
 Check that the type of paint brush you are using works with the type of paint you use.
, Apply the paint evenly and smoothly. It will not hurt if you get paint on the painter's tape.
 Carefully remove the painter's tape and discard.
