 Use this method only once every so often, as it is powerful. Repeated use of denture cleaner can cause yellowing or warping of the plastic mold on the retainer.
 Denture cleaners can be purchased over the counter at most drug stores or pharmacies, and come in cream, liquid, powder, or tablet form. As the name suggests, they are primarily used to clean dentures, but can also be used to clean retainers.
 Consult the packaging of the denture cleaner to make sure that you're soaking the retainer for the recommended time.
 The longer you can soak your retainer, the better. Just be sure to use non-alcoholic mouthwash.


Alcohol mouthwash can degrade the plastic mold of the retainer. If all you have is alcohol-based mouthwash, soak the retainer in the mouthwash for a maximum 20 minutes.
 Your retainer is now clean and ready to be used again!
