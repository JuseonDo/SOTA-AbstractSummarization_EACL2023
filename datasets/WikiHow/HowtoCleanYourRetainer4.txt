 Castile soap is much more gentle than other types of soap, being olive- and coconut-based for the most part. Named after the Castile region of Spain, castile soap does a good job of cleaning the retainer without inundating it in harsher, more harmful substances.
 Suds may not activate, as castile soap is a lot more gentle than conventional soap. Rest assured that it's still capable of cleaning.
 Try to designate a toothbrush specifically for using castile soap. Although castile soap is gentle and probably won't hurt you if ingested, it's a good idea to try to avoid implicating your regular toothbrush in this castile cleaning.
