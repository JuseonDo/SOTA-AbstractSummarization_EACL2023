 In order to save time and avoid complications, it's vital to confirm that you have a working product key; without it, trying to install Windows 7 is futile.;
, It's possible that your PC name will be required, so it's best to be prepared.
 The most common mistake is human error, so make sure your files are copied to a DVD, external hard drive or flash drive.
 Although not necessary, this free utility can help find any problems that might clash with the installation.
 Although this is entirely up to you, as the disc offers both versions, it would be wise to look up the differences and verify if your favorite software is compatible with either 32-bit or 64-bit operating systems.
 A major factor in most computer problems is malware; scanning your PC one last time can provide a clean, safe installation.
 Windows often requires updates for security and utilities, and having a solid connection will allow you to do away with these a.s.a.p.
 The Setup should launch automatically; if not, simply go to your start menu, click on My Computer, double-click your CD/DVD drive, and select the Setup.exe. NOTE: This wiki works under the assumption that the reader purchased the Windows 7 disc. If this does not apply to you, please refer to either the Windows support site, or another wiki.
, However, as said above, this will require an internet connection.
 The installer will take care of the rest! NOTE: You may receive a compatibility report; this is a standard procedure and does not mean there is a system error and the world as you know it has come to an end...well, maybe, but Windows 7 will install just fine.
 You just upgraded your OS to Windows 7. Congratulations! Give yourself a tap on the back, go have a sandwich, watch the football game. Life is good!
