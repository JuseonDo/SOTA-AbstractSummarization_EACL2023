 This costs you valuable space on your door that you can use for other things. Replace them with pencil and pen holders. These serve much more importance then pictures.;
, This may seem like taking up more room, but it isn't. Hang them by the hoods or straps on the hangers. If your locker doesn't have one, put two in.
 Your books should be upright. You can fit much more things in there and lots of other books. Plus it allows you to reach your books easier.
 Take all unnecessary papers and books home or throw them away. Shift your books over to see if there are any papers in them or under them.
 This creates more room for other things. Clean out your backpack and put all your books in your locker. Clean out your pockets and throw the trash away.
