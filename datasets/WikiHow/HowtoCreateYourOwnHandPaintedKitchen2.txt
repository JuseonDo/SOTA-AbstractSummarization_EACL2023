 Bin primer dries very fast so likewise you will need to move as quickly as you can with it.


When painting the cabinet doors start with the outside first before painting the inside. Make sure to lay off the paint with brush strokes going from top to bottom, not left to right. If there are panels on the doors, then paint these before painting the surrounding door.
,, Don’t overfill because it dries very hard and can be difficult to sand back. Once it has gone hard, less than half an hour, sand the filler, dust it back then touch it up again with the 1-2-3 primer.
 You know the drill now, starting at the top of the kitchen and working your way down.
 No need for spirits on your rag, just use water.
 Using a wet finger run the caulk into the gaps then wipe away any excess with a damp cloth. The caulk will need at least an hour to dry before you can paint over it again (if you are using oil based paint you’d have to leave the caulk to dry for 24 hours).
 Once more from the top down.
