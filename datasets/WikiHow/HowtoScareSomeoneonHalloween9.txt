 This way, kids don't suspect anything. Use smiling ghosts, cute witches, funny/dancing skeletons, etc. Another option is to make your house really scary so that kids are already apprehensive. For the scary effect, try black lights, fake bones, fake blood (you can use ketchup or fake blood), etc.
 Kids will love it and want to come up to your house to get that candy.
 Note that white outfits work the best, since a light-colored outfit is required in the next step.
 If you choose to wear a Jason mask, put the fake blood on that too. Your outfit needs to look like you just killed someone.



If you have a peephole on your door, you can hide behind your closed door. Just be sure that you won't hit anyone/anything when you fling open the door.
You can also hide behind bushes or conceal yourself in the shadow of a decoration.
 Prepare to jump out as they approach you. Once you see them reaching down for the candy, you can either jump out or wait until they are done getting the candy.
 Accompany your leap with a bloodcurdling scream for a better effect. As they run off, chase after them a little or immediately go back into hiding once you know no one is watching.
