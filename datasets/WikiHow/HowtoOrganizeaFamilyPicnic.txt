 Try to do it in the summer months, because that's when picnic season is most popular. Make sure you okay the time and date with your family. If you need to, you should make invitations so everyone can be able to come.;
, Ask your siblings and parents to invite some of their favorite friends from at work, school, or the neighborhood. The more people who come, the more fun the picnic is likely to be.
 The park, or outside in the front lawn works out just fine. Be sure to listen to any suggestions that your family might have about picking out a decent place.
 Some ideas for a good invitation is to make them out of green, black, and red construction paper for a watermelon shape, or just be creative and make up your own. The watermelon shape may be extremely popular with kids.
 It should be medium to large sized, depending on how many food items you plan to bring. If you have items that can spoil in the heat, you should have a cooler to bring with you too. If you don't have your own, you can get one at public grocery stores like Safeway, Walmart, or King Soopers.
 Know that the most popular food items to bring to your picnic are peanut butter and jelly and ham and cheese sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies, chips, and soda. Among the healthier items there are watermelon, apples, celery, and raisins, to name a few. Ask your friends to help you choose some of their favorite food items that they'd like to have.
 You can buy your own or make your own homemade recipe for chocolate chip cookies.
 Blueberry pie can easily be found frozen and ready to bake in your store's bakery freezer section.
 Volleyball or soccer are also some great game options for picnic game beginners.
 After all, isn't that what summer picnics are all about?
