@summary
wash and dry the fabric before use.

@summary
use scissors to trim the cut ends as evenly as possible.

@summary
apply the bias tape to the selvage edges of the fabric.

@summary
fold any fabric wider than 35 inches (88.9 cm) so that it does not exceed this width.

@summary
thread the unfinished end of the fabric through both rings.

@summary
hold the rings in 1 hand, and grab the tail end in the middle of its width.

@summary
pull the tail end through one ring, like threading a belt.

@summary
place your hands in the rosette formed by the fabric, and work the fabric around until it completely covers the rings.

, Apply seam binding to 1 end with fabric glue and allow to dry. This end will be the baby sling's tail.
 This step is entirely cosmetic and optional, so if you like the looks of the selvage edge, save yourself a lot of work.
 If you don't want the excess fabric, you can cut it to size.
 Separate the rings slightly, and pull the fabric back through the lower ring. Give a slight tug on the fabric to ensure both rings stay together.
 Thread the fabric back through both rings until the tail end is even with the folded length of fabric.


If you look at your sling from the selvage side, there will be 3 layers of fabric: the tail end and the 1 long length folded into 2 parts.
 Continue pulling until the entire length is through the ring.
 This makes it easier to adjust. The sling is now ready to wear.
