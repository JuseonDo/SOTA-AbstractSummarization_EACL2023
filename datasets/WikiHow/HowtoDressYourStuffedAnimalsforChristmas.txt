 These might be Christmas-colored clothes, not just ones with Christmas elves and deer on them.;
, Make sure they fit well. Use clothes like scarves, sweaters hats, mittens, boots, snow pants, etc.
, Then you can make some or all of the following suggested items of clothing.
 Cut the basic shape using an existing jacket as a template. Fold the jacket in half and cut arm holes through both layers. This ensures that the jacket won't be lopsided on your stuffed animal. Try it on your animal and modify as needed.
 Cut out rectangles and simply tie them onto your stuffed animal. Polar fleece is great for this.
 Lay out two layers of fabric and cut out the hand (or paw) shape. Sew the two pieces together along the edges, making sure you leave enough room for the paws. Repeat for the other side so you end up with two mittens.
 Lay out two layers of fabric and cut out the pants shape. Use an existing pair of pants as the template. Sew the two pieces together along the edges, making sure you leave enough room for the waist and the legs to fit.
 It's now ready for Christmas Day.
