 If you mix mint into flavored jelly, it will turn out very strange and not particularly minty.;
, Small swirl ones are better than, say, blue mints. The softer they are the easier it will be to crush them.
 Crush them as finely as possible because you don't want a whole lot of large chunks, but leave some chunky for texture.
 Mix it lightly, but don't over mix it because they jelly will get overly liquidized.
 This lets it become more solid and easier to eat and scoop.
 Whatever you want, as long as you like it.
