 Pack clothes, collars, and blankets for your stuffed animal. Your pet can't be happy without the required stuff for it.;
, If you're in the car or on an airplane, put a blanket on the seat next to you and lay it down there.
 You need to carry your animal and go sight-seeing with it. It builds plenty of memories.
 There could be shirts for dogs that you can use for your stuffed animal, rare necklaces, charms, and other things that are great for your pet. Make sure they are affordable.
 Put a blanket on the end of your bed and lay it on top! It'll be sleeping on something cozy and it'll feel protected because it is right next to you.
 Take a picture in front of something very cool. Let's say you're in Paris! Take a picture of it in front of the Eiffel Tower!

, Act like a tour guide and explain some wonderful sights. This makes your animal seem more real, and more fun! You'll also feel smart.
 In some shops that you'll see, you are going to find a stuffed animal that could be the perfect friend for your stuffed animal! Buy it one and introduce each other! Make them best friends, or siblings!

, It'll have a full tummy and it'll be just as excited as you are.
 After a long day of exploring, you'll forget there is also playing needed! Make it dance, have it jump around, and have a dinner with it! It'll be so happy that you didn't forget to play.
 That cute shirt in a foreign language or that beautiful necklace needs to be worn on your cute pet! Wearing it on the last day shows that you and your animal had a great time and you loved visiting that place. It shows festive, unique happiness. It celebrates your visit!

, Make some brownies or cookies and enjoy a movie with your pet, relaxing at home and remembering those fun times you had on your vacation!
