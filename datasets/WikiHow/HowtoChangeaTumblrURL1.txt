 After you change your URL, Tumblr will automatically update all of the pages associated with your blog, as well as any individual posts, to incorporate your new URL.


Any built-in links (which lead from one page or post to another), as well as default pages like the "Archive" page, will also be updated automatically.
However, any links that you entered personally - such as links in your blog description or outside links which direct to your Tumblr page - you will need to manually update yourself.;

,,,,, You will have to reblog it as many times as you want it queued.


Make sure your queue is set to post frequently throughout the day, and once or twice tomorrow.
