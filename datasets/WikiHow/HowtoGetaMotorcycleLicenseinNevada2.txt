Bring your current Nevada drivers license and the applicable licensing and testing fees. The knowledge testing fee will cost 25 dollars and standard licensing fees will vary on an individual basis.



If you obtain a permit, you must adhere to specific rules; such as riding the motorcycle during daylight hours only, no freeway driving, and driving under the visual supervision of a licensed motorcycle operator.

Bring a motorcycle with an engine size you want to be licensed for to avoid restrictions. For example, if you bring a moped with an engine size of 50cc, you will only be licensed to ride motorcycles with engines sized at 50cc or less.
The skills test will require you to demonstrate your working knowledge of the motorcycle and its controls. You will also complete an on-road test that includes changing lanes, stopping, and turning.
An examiner present at the skills test will inspect your motorcycle for safety and verify that the motorcycle is registered and insured with the state of Nevada.
