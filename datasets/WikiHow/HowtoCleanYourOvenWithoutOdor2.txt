 Ammonia is a powerful natural cleanser that can help to loosen and remove grease from your oven. Start by heating your oven to 150 degrees F (65.5 C). Then turn off the heat., Heat some water on your stove to boiling. Then place this water in a baking dish and set it on the bottom rack of your oven. Add 1 cup (240 ml) of ammonia to a baking dish (or oven-safe bowl) and place this on the top rack., Close the oven door and allow the ammonia and water to work on your oven overnight (or for at least 8 hours). While you sleep, the grease and grime is being loosened., In the morning, remove the baking dishes (reserving the ammonia) and the oven racks from your oven. Leave the oven door open for 15 minutes so that the oven can air out., Add 1-2 teaspoons (4.9-9.8 ml) of dish soap and 1 cup (240 ml) of ammonia, that you have reserved, to 1 quart (0.94 liters) of hot water. Using this liquid, scrub your oven with a sponge and/or scouring pad. The grease and grime should come off easily., Fill a container with warm water and rinse off your sponge. Using your sponge and the clean water, wipe down the inside of your oven to remove any traces of ammonia and dish soap. When you are finished, return the oven racks.
