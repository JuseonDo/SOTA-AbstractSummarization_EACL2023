 It will give you a more professional look.;
, If you are working on patterned paper, make sure that the blank side is facing up. This will be the inside of the pouch.
 Use a ruler and a pencil to lightly sketch the line. This will be your folding line. If you are using cardstock, you can score the line lightly instead to make it easier to fold., This will be your second folding line. Remember to use a ruler and a pencil.The bottom of the paper will be inside your money pouch. If you'd like to make it more fancy, you can cut the edge at a slight angle.
 You can use a glue stick or double-sided tape to do this. Leave the top edge alone, or you won't be able to put any money inside. For a crisper finish, run your fingernail along the fold to sharpen the crease.


If you don't have any glue or double-sided tape, you can use regular tape or even a stapler. This won't give you a very neat finish, however, but it will do if you just need something to hold your money.
 Do not glue it down. Instead, run your fingernail along the edge to make the crease sharper. For a neater finish, unfold the flap, and erase the pencil marks you drew earlier. This way, they won't be visible when you open the pouch to take the money out.
 If you'd like to give the pouch as a gift, you can write a "To:" and "From:" on the back, followed by the person's name and your name. You can also decorate the edges of the pouch with washi tape or glitter glue, and tie it off with a piece of baker's twine.
