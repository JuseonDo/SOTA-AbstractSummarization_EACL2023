 No matter what your heart says, don't look at the photo. If you want to remove the tag, do it quickly without inspecting the details of the photo. If you can't bear to look at the photo, have someone else do it. Note: it has to be someone you can trust... one hundred percent.;

 This can make you feel better and help you feel more secure.
