 You'll need coffee grounds, sea salt and body lotion for this treatment. For the body lotion, ideally a firming one would be good, but any moisturiser will work. You'll also need an old towel and cling film.
, Soak with water as hot as you can stand it, then wring out and place it on the area you want to wrap for a few minutes until it cools (thighs, arms, tummy). This helps opens up the pores and soften the skin, making the wrap even more effective. Next comes the messy bit!, It needs to be wrapped tight enough to stay on but not so tight as to become uncomfortable. If you have any bandages (like the things you get in a first aid kit) wrap this tightly over the top to help keep the cling film in place. Leave on overnight but put a towel down on the bed first!, You should notice a few inches change on the desired area!
