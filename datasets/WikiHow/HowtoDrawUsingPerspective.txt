@summary
decide which direction you want your paper to be: horizontal or vertical.

@summary
draw a straight line through the center of the page (use a ruler or straightedge for all of the lines in your drawing!).

@summary
make a dot anywhere on the horizon.

@summary
draw a box somewhere on the paper.

@summary
erase.

@summary
locate the corners closest to the vanishing point (there are two).

@summary
draw a line that is parallel to the side of the box closest to the vanishing point.

@summary
,

@summary
erase the lines that connect the vanishing point to the new corners of the building and the line inside the building.

@summary
add doors and windows.

@summary
feel free to add roads, people, other buildings, billboards, anything you can think of to the drawing!

@article
 Pick horizontal if you want the drawing to have short, small buildings. Pick vertical for tall buildings and skyscrapers.;
, This line is called the horizon. It should be parallel to the bottom of your paper. (Make sure you don't draw too darkly, this line is meant to be erased in some places!)

, This is your vanishing point. It determines which way your buildings point.
 The box will be the front view of the building. Make sure that the box's top and bottom are parallel to the top and bottom of your paper. And the sides are parallel to the sides of the paper. (If you skip this step, your drawing will turn out lopsided) Usually the box touches somewhere on the ground (below the horizon line), but then again, it's your picture, and you could make the building float if you want!(To make the building floating, draw the box above the horizon line)

, If there is a line(the former horizon line) inside of your box, erase it.
 Draw lines that connect those corners to the vanishing point.(Don't forget to draw lightly!)

You now have a building base. You can add windows and doors if you want, too!

, Adding doors and windows is simple. On the front view of the building, you can draw simple boxes. But for windows or doors on the side of the building, draw a line parallel to the side of the building. Connect the ends of the line to the vanishing point and draw another line anywhere withing the building that's parallel to the other edge of the window. Erase the extra lines.


Your building is complete!
