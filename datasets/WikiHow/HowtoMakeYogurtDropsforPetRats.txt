lay out your wax paper.

prepare the icing tube.

once that is done:

spoon three large spoonfuls of yogurt into your icing tube and close the top by rolling it up, twisting it, or simply squeezing it tight.

make yogurt drops!,

@summary
once you have finished this sheet of wax paper, quickly but gently move it into the freezer and allow them to freeze.

@summary
once you see that the drops have hardened, pull them out and place the paper on the counter.

Grab a sheet of wax paper of nearly any size. Set it down on your counter flat and weigh down the corners with something heavy. This will keep it from flying around while you squirt the drops.;
,


Roll the top of the icing tube about two inches so that you can easily see the bottom. Pick your cap and prepare your icing tube however it requires. The cap can be a simple circle or you can use fun shapes. If you have the patience, you can even make many different shapes by switching out the caps after each or every other row.


Puff out any air bubbles back into the yogurt bin until it seems smooth enough to work with.



Squirt a small drop onto your wax paper an inch from either edge. Every half inch plop another drop on the paper.

When you are ready to start another row, space them half an inch from the other rows. This way, if they start to run when you move them to the freezer they won't get mixed together.
 This could take overnight or throughout the day if you start in the morning.
 Use a dull knife to scrape them loose from the paper. Carefully roll the paper up and pour the drops into a plastic bag and seal tight.
 Feed them sparingly to your rats and they will love you forever!
