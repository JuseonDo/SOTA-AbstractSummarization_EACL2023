 You can rinse them in a small bowl or in the plastic packaging.;
, There are a few ways of doing this. You can melt them on low heat over the stove, stirring constantly (being careful not to let the chocolate burn) or you can melt them in the microwave, on low power. (see tips for more info). Be very careful not to burn the chocolate!

,,,, Enjoy!
