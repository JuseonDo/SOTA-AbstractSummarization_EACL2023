 A dish's label should indicate whether it's microwave safe. You should cover your dish in plastic wrap after adding the potatoes.Read the plastic wrap's label first to double check that it's microwave safe.
 You should microwave the potatoes on high heat for six minutes. When they're done, add your milk., You can use a large fork or a potato masher. Mash the potatoes until they're to the texture you want. This is a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer potatoes smoother than others., Take a casserole container to hold your shepherd's pie. Spread the potatoes across the bottom of the container. Use a fork or spoon to flatten the potatoes until you have a thin, even layer of potatoes at the bottom of the pan., Evenly spread the ground beef mixture over the potatoes. Again, use a fork or the back of the spoon to get an even texture covering the potatoes. Your upside down shepherd's pie is now ready to serve.
