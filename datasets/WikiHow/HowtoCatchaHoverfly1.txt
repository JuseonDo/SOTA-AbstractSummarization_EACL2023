 They usually are on flowers or plants.;

Hover Flies are generally very easy to scare off so make sure you concentrate while you are walking towards the Hover Fly and look at the Hover Fly every step that you take or else it might fly away and you would lose track of the Hover Fly.
 Is it feeling comfortable on the place or not. You must think about these questions or else once you strike and catch the Hover Fly, it would fly away. This step is only used to ensure that the Fly does not escape.
 Remember that you so this carefully as well and keep looking at the Hover Fly.


If the Hover Fly starts moving, stand still and do not pull your hand away or else this would scare the Hover Fly away.
 Your hand should be at least 1–5 centimeter (0.4–2.0 in) away from the Hover Fly.
 Ask your self the questions again from before.
, Grab the wings of the Hover Fly and hold it tight.


Just a reminder that if you fail to grab it's wings; there might be a chance where the Hover Fly still doesn't move because it may think that your hand movement was the wind touching it or something else.
Don't forget that if you didn't catch its wings; you should freeze because it may go to the same area it went before. Do not get frustrated because there is always a chance where you can finally catch a Hover Fly.
 Keep it in a jar with a good source of nature; if you want it to 'live' in a jar, you must grow a 'real' flowering plant inside the soil of the jar as it produces oxygen and Hover Flies collect pollen from the flowers.
