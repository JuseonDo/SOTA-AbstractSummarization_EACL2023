, Measure out ⅔ cups (150 grams) of white granulated sugar and ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon. Put them into a bowl, and mix them briskly together with a fork. Make sure that the cinnamon is distributed evenly throughout the sugar.
 If you have not done so already, crack open an egg over a shallow dish, and separate the yolk from the white. Discard the yolk, or save it for another recipe, then whisk the egg white. You want it to be a little foamy, but not so much that it turns white and stiff.
 Simply rinse them, then pat them dry. Roll them in the beaten egg white until they are evenly coated, then roll them in the cinnamon-sugar.
 Choose a baking dish with high walls. The plums will release lots of juices as they bake. Make sure that the dish is big enough to fit the plums comfortably; you don't want to pack them too tightly.
 They are ready when they have turned crusty and juicy. You can check if they are cooked through by poking one of them with a toothpick. If the toothpick pieces the plum easily, then the plums are ready!, They taste great with cream, custard, or vanilla ice cream.
