Forget the cute, cheap, fishing rods that are sold for kids. They are usually too difficult to cast, and the line is usually cheap. You will spend more time untangling knots than actually fishing. It will be tempting to buy the Donald Duck rod, but skip it.
Buy a good, ultra-light rod and reel. They come in five to six feet. Try to buy the shortest one you can, but not less than five feet.
Buy a spool of good line. There are a lot on the market. Stren is recommended for its ease of casting and fewer tangles. Go for a two - four pound test.
Buy a few torpedo style floats. There are some that are specially made for flies. Ask a clerk at your local tackle shop.
Buy some flies that are made for fly fishing. Make sure they are for dry fly fishing. This means they will float. They make some sponge spiders that do really well, and some called "Pan Pops," too.;
, Attach the float so that it can slide along the line to the desired length. Tie on the fly, and you're ready to go.
 Try to find one that isn't very crowded. Kids can get enthusiastic with their casting, and we want to catch fish, not people. Also, look for a pond that has a lot of pan fish. We're not after a huge bass. Kids will be very happy with a bunch of bluegill.
,, They don't have to cast far. In fact, they may have better luck casting closer to shore.
 Sometimes the fish will strike it as soon as it hits the water. If there is no action right away, start them reeling in slowly. Use a start and stop action.
 Usually there is no need to set the hook.
 If there are fish in the pond, they will hopefully catch more than enough to keep them happy. It will be fun for them.
