 It doesn't have to be a backpack or a duffel or anything, a large purse will work. Carry things such as tweezers, a pocket knife, a notebook, a camera, a voice recorder, duct tape, or anything else you can think of. (Note: Make sure the purse isn't really bright. It doesn't have to be black or dark grey, just make sure it's not bright pink with blue polka dots!);
, Example of a page: HTML CODE: 6-82-25-11. Robert Hall very dangerous, do not approach. Crystalline firewall systems: Freezes computer when firewall is breached. (Insert best friends name and information). Put this in your bag. Hint: It might also be useful to have a copy of this on your computer, too. Also you might want to write things in the notebook in languages such as German, Chinese, and Latin. Also in codes that you can decipher.
 Deliberately sit in the corner and talk to 'the person on the other end'. Handle this step carefully, so people don't think you're crazy. If someone starts to look at you strangely, turn your head so that they can just barely see the earpiece, then finger it guiltily. When they notice, pretend to be embarrassed and leave the room.
 But stop just after she/he walks into the room, saying something like this into the phone: "Bye! Nice... talking to you."

, (Bugs can just be tiny, wadded balls of tape, colored metallic). Sit down, then groan and look at where the 'bug' is. When he/she notices, pluck it off the wall, being careful to disguise the bug, then flush it into the toilet.
