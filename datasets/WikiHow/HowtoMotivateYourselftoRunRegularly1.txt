begin slowly.

@summary
if you’re out of shape, and especially if you’re pretty overweight (20-plus pounds or more), start by walking 20-30 minutes, a few times a week.

@summary
if you feel you’re ready for running now, or if you’ve done the above walking routine for at least a month and are ready to incorporate running, start with run-walking.

@summary
if you think you can run without the walking, do it for short periods at first — 10 minutes, then 12, then 15, and so on.

@summary
remember that the key principle is this: your body will adapt if you give it time.

@summary
accept that you’ll be tempted to ignore this advice and be more ambitious.

 Most beginners try to go too long or too hard; this is a mistake. You end up getting too sore (some soreness is normal at the beginning of any new activity) or worse, injured.;
, After a few weeks of this, start doing some faster walking intervals — quick walking for a minute or two, alternated with slower walking.
 That’s warming up with walking for 5-10 minutes, then jogging for a minute or so, alternating with walking rest periods.
 Add some time every 2-3 runs, but don’t be too quick to add the distance. And don’t add faster paced running in yet.
 Start slowly, let your body adapt to that, then gradually gradually add time. Later, when you’re used to running (after a couple of months), you can add intensity.
 But don't ignore it; you’ll have a much better experience with running for following it.
