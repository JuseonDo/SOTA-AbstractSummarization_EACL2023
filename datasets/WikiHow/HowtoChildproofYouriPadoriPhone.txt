If this is the first time you are enabling restrictions, you will need to choose a passcode. Be sure to select something that you will remember!







, This will prevent your child from accidentally removing important applications from your device or installing applications that could cost you money.


Be sure to also turn "In-App Purchases" off as well so that your child doesn't accidentally spend money on enhancements for the game.
 Earlier, you may have restricted the ability to add or delete apps, but it's best to be safe than sorry.
 All apps, movies, and TV shows that are downloaded are rated appropriately and can be restricted.
 Do the same with "Find Me By Email" and "Allow Game Invites." This will prevent strangers from being able to find your child.
