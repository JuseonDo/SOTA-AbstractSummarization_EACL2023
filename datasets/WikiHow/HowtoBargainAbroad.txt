 Keep in mind that no one is going to sell you something unless they are going to make a profit.


Don't worry about insulting the merchant by offering an incredibly low price. If the merchant turns up his nose and appears insulted, move on to the next stall. You just established that the item cannot be bought at that time for or below the price you quoted.

, Remember that by paying an outrageous price for something, you are dooming the next poor traveler to pay the same or higher price for that object. By not getting ripped off you are not only benefiting yourself, but future travelers.
 This is part of traveling, and it keeps you sharp.
 Prices are often indicated much like any western shopping center and they will give you a rough idea of what things cost. Usually, purchases at the supermarket cost more than the same items sold in the street market.
 Try to imitate their attitude.
 In developing countries, start with a maximum of a quarter of the first price, and don't go over half of the first price. You can often buy something for 10% of the original price.
 Start to walk away, show an empty pocket or a handful of change. Smile sadly and shake your head. Smile happily and wink at the nice try, but signal no thanks.
 This is bargaining, not diplomacy or war. Don't throw the money down, or act like a rude bully.
 Make an offer much less than that, and don't go over your limit. Walk away first. You can always buy it elsewhere.
 The seller then has the advantage. Pretend indifference if you have to.
