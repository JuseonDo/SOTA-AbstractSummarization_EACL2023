@summary
note/s: you'll need a small/large tennis racket(small ones are better, but make sure they're not too small!),

@summary
put the ball in the centre of the racket (the trick is to keep it in the middle) and bounce it up to your eye level and keep going without it falling onto the floor.

 and some patience.
 Once you've mastered that, start doing even higher and harder bounces! How many can you do? How high can you get the ball and? Try it!


If the ball flies in a different direction, you'll have to run to keep up with it. Make sure there's plenty of room around you! Use all appropriate equipment and make sure you use your common sense at all times.
