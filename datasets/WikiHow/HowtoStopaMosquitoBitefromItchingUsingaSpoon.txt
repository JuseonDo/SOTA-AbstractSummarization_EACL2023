 It’s always a good idea to disinfect an area that has been bitten or stung by an insect.


Use warm water and antibacterial soap to clean area.
Pat dry with clean, dry towel.;
, Bring water to a rolling boil and remove from heat.
 Allow spoon to heat up but avoid letting it get to the point where it’s scalding--about 15 to 20 seconds will do the trick.
 You should feel itch relief within a few seconds of applying the spoon. The heat from the spoon will destroy the protein that causes the itching.
