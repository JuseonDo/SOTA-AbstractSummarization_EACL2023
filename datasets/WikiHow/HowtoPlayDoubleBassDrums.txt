exercise daily - you don't want to pull a muscle do you?,

@summary
learn how to perform both the heel up and heel down techniques.

@summary
once you've figured out which way you like to play double bass "heel-up or heel-down" play 16th notes alternating right-left-right-left and gradually get faster (wait until you can play perfect 16th notes before increasing your speed!).

@summary
go on the internet and find out the 25 rudiments of drumming.

@summary
once you have the 16th notes down work on 32nd notes then 64ths then rolls.

afterwards get a piece of music that you play in concert band and play the snare part on your feet.

@summary
once you have completed this and you sound like a god at rolling on the bass then you must decide what type of music you would like to learn using the 25 rudiments of drumming and implementing them into your feet.

@summary
an essential thing that is often overlooked is tempo and consistent timing.

@summary
do not be surprised if you see no results after a month; there will probably be none.

 Make sure that you stretch before playing (One recommends doing 3 sets of 25 calf raises 30 seconds prior to playing).;

The heel down technique is simple, yet most drummers find it more difficult than heel up. Put both of your feet on the foot pedals so that they completely cover them. Then, just play a rhythm by following one beat after the other. Do not raise your foot off the pedal, you want your foot to stay in contact with the foot board so you will have better control of the entire motion of each hit. You may feel muscle strain in the front of your calf, that means that you are using the correct muscles, but don't overdo it!






The heel up technique - place your feet onto the pedal the same way as in Heel down technique, but lift your heel off the pedal. The ball of your foot should always stay in contact with the foot board so that you maintain control of the entire movement of each hit. Kick one beat after the other. Make sure that you rest the beater of the pedal on the bass drum between hits so that your muscles have a chance to relax. Instead of feeling muscle strain in your calf, you may feel it in the front of your thigh (quadriceps). Again, don't overdo it!







, Try the reverse: left-right-left-right. Try different patterns and repeat each many times. There is a book called "Stick Control" that has many different pattern suggestions.
 Such as: Single stroke rolls, Double stroke rolls, Paradiddles, Flams, Flamacue, Flamadiddle, and many more.
,,, Use a metronome and start slow (60 or 70 bpm). Then slowly build up. Make sure your timing is 100% accurate.
 It takes much longer than that. Measure your progress every two months or so.
