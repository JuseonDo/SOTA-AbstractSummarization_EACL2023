Your doctor may also recommend that you take time off work. This will depend upon what type of job you have, and the physical demands your line of work entails.
It is definitely advisable to refrain from heavy lifting and other strenuous jobs.
 Try exploring other forms of sexual activity that do not put the same strain on your cervix that intercourse does.
