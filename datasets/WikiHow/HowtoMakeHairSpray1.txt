 Try to use filtered or distilled water if you can. Ordinary tap water contains too many chemicals and minerals, which may cause buildup in your hair overtime. Heating the water will make the salt easier to dissolve.;
, You can also use Epsom salt instead., Coconut oil will be the most nourishing for your hair, but it is solid at room temperature. You will likely need to warm your hairspray under hot water each time before you use it. If this bothers you, try argan or olive oil instead.If you have oily hair, reduce the oil to one teaspoon (five milliliters).
If you have dry hair, consider adding an extra one to two teaspoons (5 to 10 milliliters) of oil.
 If you'd like your hair spray to be unscented, you can leave the essential oil out.For extra holding powder, stir in one to two teaspoons (5 to 10 grams) of hair gel. This is great for those with curly hair., Place a funnel down the neck of a spray bottle. Holding the bottle steady, carefully pour the mixture into the bottle. If you can, try to use a glass spray bottle. Many people find that the oils (both coconut and essential) will degrade plastic bottles overtime.
 This will help further blend the ingredients. Overtime, the oils will separate, so you will need to shake your bottle before you use it. If you used coconut oil, this will be even more noticeable, and you'll need to hold the bottle under hot water for a few seconds.
