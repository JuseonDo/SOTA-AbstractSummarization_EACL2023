 Lay them on their shells, so the fish is pointing up and not facing the plate.;
, The towel should be completely saturated with water, but not dripping or leaking.



Keep the towel wet. Continue to check it, and if it begins to dry out, soak it again and place it back on top of the oysters.
 Freezing the oysters will kill them, but it is important to keep them very cold. Do not place them under any raw meats that may leak onto the oysters. They can stay fresh in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days.
 Run them under cold water and remove them from their shells by scrubbing them with a stiff brush.
