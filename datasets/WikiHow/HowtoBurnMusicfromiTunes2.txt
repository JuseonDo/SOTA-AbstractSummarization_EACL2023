Smart playlists let you create playlists of songs that match certain criteria, like genre or artist name. Smart playlists are nice when burning CDs, because you can limit them by total size.
 In the Smart Playlist dialog box, click the first dropdown menu, and then click Media Kind. The default Media Kind is Music, which is what you want.
,,,, If you see a track in the playlist you don't want, click it to select it, and then press Delete. The track is deleted and a new random track is added in its place.
