 You'll need a reasonably long, leather jacket, and then you'll need to distress it for that 'battle hardened' look.
 You'll need the waistcoat in burgundy.
 However, khakis are recommended.
 You should get them in brown suede. Amazon is a good place to get these

, It may sound silly, but it's the most accurate thing you can find at an affordable price. Tie it accordingly like they did in "Day of the Doctor." However, there is a replica at Magnoli Clothiers - however, it is rather expensive.
 You'll need to have it in the sort of sticky-uppy style (not unlike David Tennant's). If you don't feel like dying it white, you can always buy a wig and dye that.
 For fake ones, go on Amazon and search for rapper goatee. you should dye it white like the hair.
 Any brown leather bandolier works as long as it can hold a sonic screwdriver.
, If you're dead-set on accuracy, get some prosthetic make up (like the kind for the Hartnell costume).
