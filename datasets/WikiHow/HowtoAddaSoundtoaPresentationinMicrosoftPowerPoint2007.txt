 To add a specific sound file, select to "Insert sound from file.";
,,, You have inserted a sound into your presentation, but the choices as to how you present it are open to your whimsy and creativity.

If you would like to change your choice of whether to play the sound automatically, or after a mouse click, access the drop down menu in the "Sound Tools - Options" contextual tab in the Ribbon.






By default, PowerPoint 2007 leaves the sound object as a visible object in your slide. This can be toggled by clicking the box labeled "Hide during show," located in the "Sound Tools - Options" contextual tab. This will help you have a cleaner presentation when playing a sound automatically, but if you have selected to start the sound playback upon clicking the object (see Step 3), you will not be able to do so if you've elected to hide the object during the presentation.






Increasing the file size limit for embedded sounds will absorb the sound file, if it is under the limit, into your presentation's single ".pptx" file. If the sound(s) you have included in your presentation are above the limit you specify, you will need to include the sound file(s) in the same location as your ".pptx" file, wherever you save it or share it (e.g., you would attach the ".pptx" file and the accompanying ".mp3" file in email if you were to be sending your deck to a colleague).
