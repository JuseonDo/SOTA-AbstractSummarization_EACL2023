 Squeeze the fruit gently to check for a small amount of give. The avocado should be soft, but not mushy.;
,, Remove the seed from the fruit.
, Slice a thin piece of the top and bottom of the seed using a sharp knife. Opening the seed slightly will aid in its germination.
, Place the dish in a dark area, such as a closet, for 2 to 3 weeks.
 Observe the seed periodically for root growth. When the roots are 3 inches (7.62 cm) in length, the seed is ready to plant.
, Face the pointed end of the seed upward and balance it with the toothpicks on the sides of the glass, making sure 1/4 of the bottom of the seed is resting in water.
, Check the water level and refill when the level goes below 1/4 of the bottom half of the seed.
 In about 2 to 4 weeks, the seed should crack and a root should appear, followed by a stem. When the root is about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) long, it will be ready for potting.
 Line a small planting pot with drainage holes with a small amount of gravel. Fill the rest of the pot with potting soil.
 Leave the top sprouts of the root system exposed, as well as 1/3 of the upper part of the seed. Pat the dirt firmly around the seed and water.
