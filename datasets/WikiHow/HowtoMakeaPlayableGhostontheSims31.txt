 You can make them however you want.;
, You can kill them however you want, depending on the ghost colour. One favourite is drowning (build a pool, make the Sim get in, delete the ladder and build a wall right at the edge of the pool) but there are many other ones.
 It takes about 5-7 days, although it can be faster sometimes. When it comes, you should get a phone call on your Sim's mobile. Accept it.
