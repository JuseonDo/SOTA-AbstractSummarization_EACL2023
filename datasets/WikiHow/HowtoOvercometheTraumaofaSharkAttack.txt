 How upset you are afterwards will depend on how badly injured or scared after the attack you were.;
, If you died during your shark attack, that would not have been a good thing. Your family and friends would probably miss you a lot and it would cause them a lot of pain.
 To get your mind off things.
 This technique is especially effective if you have nightmares.
 Doing so will only make your fear worse.
 Understanding the animals better will help you understand why they attacked.
 Remember that this takes a while to do, so don't expect it to happen overnight.
 Try going to swimming pool or river first to help calm your fear.

 Be sure to do this gradually, though.
