 Most teachers tell their students or send home a letter to alert parents to the homework involved in this level of schooling.;
, For example, if 5 homework assignments are required in a week, you may want to allow extra play time, a family game or an hour of TV as an incentive.


The incentive should be chosen as something the child likes, but does not encourage bad behaviors.
 You can use a word processing program with a "Table" function, or a spreadsheet program.


The columns should include some or all of the following: subject, assignment, due date, materials needed, time the assignment will take and a space to mark when the homework is done.






The rows should be blank spaces for the child to fill in their homework chart. There should be enough rows for a week's worth of homework.






Leave enough space at the top to write the week's dates. Leave enough space on the side to use a 3-hole-punch.
,, Ask them to fill it out as homework assignments are given throughout the day and week.
,


Checking can be done as frequently as is needed to develop responsibility and trust between you and your child.
 Reward accordingly.
