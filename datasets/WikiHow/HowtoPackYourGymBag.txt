 This is going to be your gym bag, so make sure it is big enough.;
, Fill the bottle with water - you will need it. Water is lost during exercise, so hydration is important!

, You will likely be hungry after gym due to the use of energy.
 This means you can wash your face after gym to remove the sweat.


If you are going to shower afterwards, keep some soap with you. You can also keep shampoo, but it will take longer and you might be late for your next class.
 You don't want to smell bad, so it is important that you apply these two cosmetics.
, Keep something loose, because you are just going to draw attention with tight clothes.
 Have a friend hold it to cover you while you change, but make sure you do the same for them!

,, You don't want to wear those sweaty, stinky gym shoes all day.
 The easiest way to do this is by keeping a hair tie, hair clips and hair brush, so you can quickly fix your hair in a messy bun or sleek ponytail.
