 Soapnut (also known as reetha) cleans hair without stripping its natural oils.The shikakai powder naturally conditions the hair and leaves it smooth and soft., In some places, it is possible to purchase this solution already made up as a shampoo. If you cannot find it, try making it as follows:Place equal amounts of soapnut (reetha) and shikakai into a mortar or blender. If wished, add the same amount of Indian gooseberry (amla), for strengthening the hair. Grind or blend the ingredients together until you have a powder.
Make a shampoo from the powder. Tip the powder into two to three glasses of water. Stir well to combine. Let stand overnight.
Boil the water the following morning. Boil until it reduces by half. Remove from the heat and let cool.
Strain through muslin or a similar thin cloth. It is now ready for use. Just be sure to keep away from eyes when using, to avoid bad stinging.
 Be careful. Don't overdo the job. Be gentle. If required, take some oil into your palms and apply to the ends, to remove the tangles easily., Start applying the shampoo. Massage it in part by part. When you start applying in some part of your hair, massage gently. You will not get a lather. Take some more shampoo and put it in the same part. Now you will see the lather. Do this process all over your hair, massaging in thoroughly., Massage gently. Wash off with cold water so that it locks the cuticles and softens your hair., Once you finished washing your hair, wrap it in a towel for 10-15 minutes. Take off the towel after 10 to 15 minutes and try sun drying it. Don't blow dry it., Remove the tangles, only using your fingers. This will condition your hair and also softens it., Keep it in the bun for one to two hours (but don't try this step if you have migraine, sinusitis, etc., or it will worsen the pain)., Start combing with a wide toothed comb and enjoy the shining, bouncy and lustrous looks. The frizz will have gone.
