A chronological resume is listed by dates and is recommended for those looking for a job in a similar field as their previous work.
A functional resume does not have dates and is all explained in paragraph format. Instead listing by date, you describe your best skills. This is good for those changing career fields, going back to the workforce from a long break, or for students.
A chrono-functional resume is a combination of both of the above. Almost anyone can use this format if you want to add more detail to your jobs. This form is actually becoming more common.;
, An address is important because managers need to know how far you will commute.
 Display your most attractive qualities so employers can notice right away.
 GPA is not needed.


If you are a student or recent college graduate, display your education after the objective or summary on your resume.
If you have had several years of work experience and attended school far back, place this section at the very bottom of your resume because your experience and summary should be your main highlights.
 Start with your most recent position, and list 3-4 jobs total. No more than that! The duties that you list should reflect your summary of qualifications and describe your clear capabilities. Therefore, it must look organized and easy to read.
, This is the 21st century. It is assumed that you should already have a separate reference page when you meet employers. Do not place them on your resume.
