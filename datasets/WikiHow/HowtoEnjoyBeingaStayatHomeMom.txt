remember that you have value.as a sahm, you have chosen to take out time to teach your children your values and morals in a more hands-on and directed way than might happen if you were working as well.in doing so, you will be helping the next generation carry on what you consider important, and that's as valuable a role as any in this world.

 For example, common routines are breakfast, class, snack, lunch, nap time, and afternoon snack, and it is important to leave time slots open for flexibility, such as for special events and activities. While you might be tempted to see more freedom without having a schedule in place, you'll find it benefits both you and your children to know what is coming up next throughout the day, and it helps remove that feeling of "where did that day go?!".,, There are only so many hours in a day and no mom is a superwoman. Outsource routine tasks that are important to complete, but keep you from focusing on your children, such as cleaning or ironing (realizing that this "outsourcing" can be to other family members!). If that's not affordable or achievable, sort out a way to get it done so that it won't stress you out. For example, it is a good idea to lower high expectations of a perfectly maintained home and it helps to find clothes that don't need regular ironing or repairs.
 If you are a stay-at-home mom, you are in "give" mode the majority of the time. Serving your children and family when your tank is on "E" is dangerous for everyone. Schedule "mom time" on the calendar at least once a week. This could be catching up with friends, going to the movies, having a facial or massage, or taking a hike on your favorite local trail.
 Children are a ton of work, but they are also loads of fun. Don't allow yourself to get so overwhelmed by the work that you forget to enjoy your children. Watch how they have fun and join in - they'll love having mom share in their games, coming down to their level.
