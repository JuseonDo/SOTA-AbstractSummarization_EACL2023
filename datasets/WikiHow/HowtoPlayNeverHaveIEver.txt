 Typically, you'd need at least five people to join in, but there can be as many as you want, provided you have enough alcohol.;
, This means getting out the glasses and the alcohol and gathering chairs around a table. The table is preferably circular. You'll need to get at least an equivalent number of shot glasses for each player.
 This will keep the game flowing. One of the players can pour the drinks, but the drunker they get, the more difficulty they might find in doing so.
 This isn't actually necessary, but it's recommended as a cautionary addition. This person can be a good friend who isn't really into drinking or simply isn't in the mood to play, and they can sit nearby just to make sure someone doesn't get dangerously drunk or accidentally hurt themselves. They can also be the designated driver, or be the one to call up a cab for the players to drive home in. In addition, this person can be the one to pour the alcohol also.
 This is best left in the hands of the sober friend, because this may be a factor into who wins the game.
 This is when you choose who's going to go first.
 The statement has to be something that person has never attempted or done before. For instance, "Never have I ever been to a brothel." Anyone who has been to a brothel has to drink a shot of alcohol.
 This is meant to encourage strategy. If you don't think anyone's done it, don't say it.
 The game can go on as long as everyone's able and interested, but when it finally ends, there are two ways of determining the winner. The winner is either the one who drank the least shots, or the one who acts the most sober, though the former is more accurate.
