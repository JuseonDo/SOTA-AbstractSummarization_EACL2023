@summary
find a rug importer in your area, preferably one who deals directly with the weaver(s) who made them, they tend to be better aware of their products' origins and quality.

@summary
come to the store with a basic idea of what you want, and the level of intricacy you're going for (generally, the more intricate the knot, the more expensive the rugs will be).

@summary
begin browsing rugs that are in your price range, and pick out maybe 10-12 that you like.

@summary
take your list of rugs and sort them into groups.

@summary
from those groups you've made, depending on the size and quantity of the groups, eliminate two or three from each.

@summary
if possible, get your remaining rugs next to each other for comparison.

@summary
if elimination by comparison leaves you with one rug, wait!!,

@summary
if you are left with 3 rugs, try to eliminate it to two.

@summary
once the rugs arrive at your house, bring them to the room you're decorating.

@summary
don't be pressured to make a decision.

 You should also lean towards someone who's been in the business for a decent amount of time. **see tips for more about dealer finding;
, If you don't know exactly what you're going for, that's okay too. A really great rug connoisseur will be able to help you identify exactly what style would fit you and your space best.
 Depending on the size you're looking at, you may not be able to lay them all out next to each other, but do your best to remember them as you view the others.
 Examples would be 'rugs with heavy use of red' 'rugs with more intricate patterns' and the like.
 Then you should have maybe 3 or 4 rugs left. At this point you would probably be able to put them next to each other.
 If there are any you can eliminate from there, go right ahead.
 Don't make any decisions until you see the rug IN YOUR HOUSE where you want it. The lighting of the room may throw off your decision or take it in another direction completely.
 If you can't, tell your rug dealer these are the 3 you would like to be brought to your house. Set up a date for the dealer to bring the rugs over.
 If seeing the rugs in your room's light makes your decision, congratulations! If not, take the time to view the rug from all angles of the room. Are there things about them you like, don't like, things that will bother you over time?

, If your style has gone in a separate direction, say so. You can always go back and keep shopping.
