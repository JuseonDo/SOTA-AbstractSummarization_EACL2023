 Do this until the steak is up to room temperature.;
, Remove the pan and steak and place the steak on a chopping board.
 Do this until the steak has absorbed the oil, then sprinkle kosher salt and black pepper on both sides.


Make sure you rub in the salt and pepper well.
 Carefully place the steak into the pan and let it sear on one side until brown.


This should take about four minutes.
 Watch carefully to ensure that this side does not turn black.
 Turn the heat off and place the steak on another chopping board. Allow the steak to cool and rest for at least ten minutes.


This is so that when you cut the steak, the steak won't bleed. Bleeding is the last thing you want.
 Make sure it is thinly and evenly sliced.


To prevent crying, try leaving the onion in the refrigerator for ten minutes before slicing it.
 Combine the ingredients and drizzle with the lemon juice. Add some kosher salt to taste.
 Ensure that everything is well combined and add extra salt if necessary.
 Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the crisp toast. Make sure you don't make it soggy. Rub the top of the slices of toast thoroughly with the garlic clove.
 Add coriander leaves for a delightfully fresh taste.
 Place the slices of steak on each piece of toast.
