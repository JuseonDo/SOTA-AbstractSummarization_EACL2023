, It is best to prepare the soil for the new plant before digging the peonies out of the ground. Plant the newly-divided plants as quickly as possible so the roots do not have time to dry out.


Choose an area that receives full sun. Although peonies can survive in partial shade, they do best in areas that receive at least six hours of direct sun daily.
Till the soil and enrich it with peat moss or compost if necessary. Peonies prefer well-drained, rich soil.
, This will give you a better look at the roots. You must be able to see the buds (eyes) at the top of the root structure. Rinse the roots off with the garden hose.
 Make sure that each new division has at least three buds and an adequate root system.
, If the buds are more than 2 inches (5 cm) below the soil, remove the plant and add soil to the hole. Peonies planted to a greater depth may fail to flower.
 Tamp the soil down to firm it.
 Keep them well-watered for several weeks while the new plants grow their root base.
 The layer of mulch helps protect the soil from thawing and re-freezing during the winter months, which could kill the plant.
