  If you can't do this, you can't do a 180.

If you can get at least 100 jumps normally without falling off, you will be just fine doing a 180.;
,, This doesn't need to be very high; eight inches would be perfect,,

Your body will quickly follow your shoulders, so don't flick your shoulders too far.
 Otherwise you will go flying in a random direction, so you will most likely fall.
