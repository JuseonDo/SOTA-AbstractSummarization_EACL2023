 Place the stopper in the bottom of the sink. Sit your stuck pots in the sink. Turn the hot water faucet on. Wait for the sink to fill and do not let any water get in the upper pot., Wait five to 10 minutes. The difference in temperature will cause the top pot to contract in size and the bottom pot to enlarge slightly in size, thereby making it easier for you to unstick them., For instance, you could choose to twist the bottom pot counterclockwise while twisting the top pot clockwise, or vice versa. Don a pair of rubber dishwashing gloves in order to improve your grip.
