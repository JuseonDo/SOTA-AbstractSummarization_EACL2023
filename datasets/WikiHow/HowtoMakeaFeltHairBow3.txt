 The size of the rectangle is up to you; the width of the rectangle determines the length of the bow.
 Use a contrasting color for this piece, for example, the first piece could be black, and the second piece white.
 Ensure that the outer border is the exact same measurement on all four sides. Allow to dry.
 This draws both rectangles into a cinched form in the middle. Wrap florists wire around this, or glue or stitch in place.
 Wrap this around the center join to cover up the wire or stitching. Glue or stitch in place at the back of the bow.
 It's now ready to wear.
