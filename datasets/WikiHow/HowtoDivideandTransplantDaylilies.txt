 It is best to divide them in early spring before they begin their yearly growth or wait until late summer when flowering is done. Whenever you choose to divide the plants, they may not produce flowers the first summer, or may produce fewer flowers than normal.;

Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil.
Dig the soil and till it to a depth of 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm).
Amend the soil by adding organic compost if necessary. Daylilies do best in rich, moist soil.

Stick the tines of a garden fork into the soil 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) away from the base of the plant.
Push the garden fork's handle down gently to pry the roots from the ground.
Move the fork over and continue loosening the roots. Move the fork all the way around the clump of daylilies until the roots are free from the soil.
Lift the loosened clump of plants and soil from the ground with a shovel.



Stick 2 garden forks, back to back, into the center of the root ball.
Push the handles of the forks apart, separating the roots.
Divide each new division in the same way if your clusters are still too large or if you want to make more new transplants. Be sure that each division has at least three sets of fan leaves.



Dig a hole for each new transplant. The hole should be deep enough to plant the roots to the same depth as they were before. Make the holes 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) wider than the width of the root balls.
Plant the new divisions into the holes and then backfill the holes with soil. Tamp down the ground around each plant to firm it up.
Apply a layer of mulch to the soil.
 If you transplant lilies in the spring before they flower, do not cut the foliage back.
 Keep the area well-watered until they become established.
