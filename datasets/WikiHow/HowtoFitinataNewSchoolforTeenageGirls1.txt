@summary
before you start school, have a day for your headmaster or someone to show you where all your classrooms are.

@summary
also, ask the school if they could set you up with a buddy on your first day so they can tell you who's nice and who's not - it's best to have someone show you the ropes!

 While they're doing that, look at all the other girls in the class and see what type of clothes they're wearing. Depending on the school, you may be required to wear a uniform. Usually, it's a choice between skirts or trousers. If your new school requires a uniform, try to choose similar clothing styles as the other girls. However, if your school doesn't require a uniform, just go for your own style but avoid breaking the school dress code (ex: high skirts will get you in trouble).
