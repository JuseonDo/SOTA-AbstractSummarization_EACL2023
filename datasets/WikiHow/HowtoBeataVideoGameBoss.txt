 If you just started the game, then take a small break and stretch. If you've been playing for a little longer than a couple hours, take some time to really limber out and consider getting something to eat, or doing anything else you haven't been able to do since you started playing. This quick break is mainly to take you out of the tightening moment of stress and give you momentary relief.;
, You may have needed a moment to adjust and make yourself comfortable.
 Refocus your attention from what you can't do to something you can do to keep morale up.
 Sometimes it's necessary to rearrange, equip new abilities, or stock up in items that you may need in order to defeat the boss. Take the time to really go back through your menu and make sure you have everything you need. If you don't, consider buying more items to heal or help you even if you want to conserve money; it's better to be overly equipped than understocked.
 Sometimes, stress can make you angry and can actually boost your gaming and encourage you to really push through certain stages of the game. If you attempt something you ignored before and prevail, it may boost up your confidence and enhance your reflexes while letting you get use to the game's controls even more.
, Instead of getting really worked up and discouraged, it's best sometimes to get away from the game and find something else to do until you decide that you want to try again. Video games are centered around being fun, so the instant it becomes too overwhelming it can lose its power to be a fun thing to do and become a hassle.
 All Video Game Bosses have a weakness. Try different tactics and strategies. Also, try to use the level to your advantage.
