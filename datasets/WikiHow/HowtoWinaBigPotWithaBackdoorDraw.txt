 A backdoor flush draw is a situation where on the flop you have three cards to a flush and need two more of your flush cards to make your flush.;
, You have either:


♥-♣ on a flop of ♥-♥-♠ or
♥-♥ on a flop of ♥-♣-♠

,


♥-♣ on a board of ♥-♥-♠-♥, continue on.
♥-♥ on a board of ♥-♣-♠-♦, fold.
 If you did not complete your flush - fold.


♥-♣ on a board of ♥-♥-♠-♥-♥, bet, raise and reraise.
♥-♣ on a board of ♥-♥-♠-♥-♣, fold, a flush is a hand with five cards of the same suit.
 With a pot with $23 call a $1 bet, with a pot with $46 call a $2 bet and so on.
 Having done this, when you must make a decision, at the flop, to continue with a backdoor flush draw, you should have a quality hand. One or both of your hole cards should be an ace or a king.


A♥-K♣ on a flop of 8♥-T♥-6♠ - continue
K♥-Q♥ on a flop of T♥-2♠-3♣ - continue
J♦-T♦ on a flop of 4♦-K♣-T♣ - fold

,
A♣-J♣ on a board of J♦-K♥-2♣-A♠. When you have a made hand, like a two pair, you should continue. Even if, by the betting, you think another player has a set of kings, continue to the river because you are not totally sure of that and because two pairs is a drawing hand too. With your two pairs, two aces and two jacks would beat a set of kings or a straight.
Q♣-J♣ on a flop of A♣-9♥-5♠ - continue you have a second, nut backdoor flush draw.



Q♥-J♥ on a flop of T♥-2♠-5♦. A backdoor straight draw adds to the strength of your backdoor flush draw. Read the section on outs in "Small Stakes Hold 'em".
J♠-T♠ on a flop of A♠-8♣-6♦. The backdoor flush draw is not strong, but add the value of two gapped backdoor straight draws to it: J♠-T♠-A♠ and J-T♠-8♣.
 You want to see the turn for a bet and not for two or three bets. Use caution in pursuing a backdoor flush draw from early positions and with aggressive players yet to act
