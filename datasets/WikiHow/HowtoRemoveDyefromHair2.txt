 Palmolive and Dawn are two popular dish soaps you can try. Mix it with a quarter-sized amount of your regular shampoo.
 Rub up a soapy lather, allowing the dish soap to penetrate deeply into the hair. Lather your hair for at least a couple of minutes.
 Dish soap causes hair to become very dry and strips out natural oils, so be sure to rinse it out thoroughly. You will probably have to repeat this technique more than once, but because dish soap is so harsh, don't repeat it too many times in a row.
 The results won't be drastic right away, but you should start to see the color fade significantly after doing this for two to three days.
 Always follow the last rinse with a deep conditioning treatment such as hot oil. Dish soap is extremely drying; your strands will need a dose of hydration every time you use it.
