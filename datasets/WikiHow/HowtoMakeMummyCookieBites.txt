 Let it sit on the countertop for a few minutes.


Never microwave or force-soften the cream cheese as it might curdle.;
, You can use your hands to crush the bag or you can use a small, wooden mallet to gently tap the cookies until they are crushed.
 Blend well until the cream cheese and Oreos form a thick dough.
 These balls will be the actual mummy bites so make them the size you desire (1 inch/2.5cm balls will be sufficient).
 Fit as many as you can on cookie sheet and grab another sheet if necessary. Make the entire batch in one shot.


Place cookie sheet(s) in the freezer and freeze balls for approximately 10 minutes.
 Take the chocolate manufacturer’s instructions into consideration as well, to ensure the perfect melted consistency.
 Dip each ball into the melted chocolate. Wait a few seconds before dipping into the chocolate, as you want the chocolate to be warm but not too hot (which may melt and/or compromise the shape of the cream cheese/Oreo balls).
 Refrigerate for approximately 1 hour or until bites have hardened.
 Smooth the bag before sealing to remove air. Put the bag aside while the bites chill.



Snip a small amount on one end of the freezer bag to create a small hole.






Squeeze/drizzle chocolate over each bite to create a “wrapped” gauzy effect.



Replace sheet(s) in the refrigerator and allow them to remain until you are ready to serve.
