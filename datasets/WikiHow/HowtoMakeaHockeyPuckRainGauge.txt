hockey puck.

drill press.

@summary
find the centre of the hockey puck:

@summary
estimate the location of the centre and make a small mark.

@summary
insert the spade bit into the drill press.

@summary
,

@summary
set the drill press speed low.

@summary
adjust the drill press depth of plunge, so the spade bit will leave about 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 inch (0.6 to 1.0 cm) undrilled material at the bottom of the hole.

@summary
use clamps, a drill press vise, or other mechanism to hold the hockey puck securely on the drill press table, with the centre of the hockey puck exactly positioned under the point of the spade bit.

@summary
,

@summary
drill the hole in the puck.

@summary
clean up the puck and erase any pencil lines.

@summary
,

@summary
test by inserting the rain gauge base into the hole.

@summary
remove the rain gauge from the hockey puck, and run a brass flat-head screw through the centre of the hole.

@summary
you're done!

 Cost about $1.00



 


Rain gauge tube. From a farm supply or hardware store. Cost about $2.00






Brass screw, flat head. Cost about 20c, or package of 10 for $2.00





;
, An inexpensive press is just fine for this project.






Spade bit, same size as base of the rain gauge.







Measure the distance from the mark to the edges of the puck.






Move the mark until all distances to the edge are the same.






If drawing lines on the puck, keep them in the central area so they will disappear when the hole is drilled in the puck.
, Hockey pucks are soft. Using a slow speed prevents melting of the edge of the hole.
 You do not want to drill all the way through the hockey puck.
, Do not go all the way through.
, It should be loose enough that it can be removed for reading small amounts of rain, and for emptying. But it should be tight enough that it will stay upright and not be blown out by a gust of wind.
 That screw is used for anchoring the hockey puck to a board (deck railing, for instance). When snugged down, the screw should not interfere with the rain gauge.
 Install the rain gauge outside, and hope for a rainy day to come soon.
