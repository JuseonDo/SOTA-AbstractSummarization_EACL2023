@article
 Run your thumb and index finger across the crease to ensure the leaf folds neatly and firmly.
 Roll it downward into a tight roll. Keep a firm hold on the bottom and smooth it over as you roll downward.


Add a few dabs of hot glue to the inside ends of the rolled leaf to hold the roll in place. Allow a few minutes for the glue to dry before using it.
 Make sure the full leaf is facing upward with the rolled piece sitting directly in the middle (along the middle vein).
 The rolled leaf should be sitting in the front (and center area) of the folded leaf.
 Grasp the right side of the folded leaf and roll it inward, toward the rolled leaf. Tuck underneath the other side of the bottom area of the rolled leaf and add a dab of hot glue.
 Lay the end along the base of the other side of the leaf. Add a dab of hot glue to hold it in place.


Fold the leaf in half, backwards with the crease running along the top of the rolled/folded leaf.






Roll the sides inward, following the same way you folded/rolled the previous leaf but this time, bend the edges/ends outward so they resemble a flowering petal.






Glue the ends and hold until dry.
