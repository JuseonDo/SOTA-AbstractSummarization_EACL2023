 This should go without saying, but you never know what some people might do.;
, Being awesome is not a legitimate reason.
 In the movie, Neil just randomly asks his friends, and they more or less agree. In real life it isn't that simple. You may have to annoy them until they agree. (It worked on Todd, after all!)

, It doesn't have to be an Indian cave, since although that would be good for authenticity reasons, those in urban areas may have trouble finding one.
 It is split into two volumes, volume one being Chaucer to Burns, and volume two being Wordsworth to Tennyson. Digital copies of this work can be downloaded for free with the links provided below. You can also purchase reprints of the book via Amazon.com the range around $30 USD.
,, Live each day to the fullest!

, Start with quotes from the movie, then just random poems. Write your own if you want!

,, Throw a desk set off the roof, call yourself Nuwanda, have a phone call from God, whatever.
, Above all else the DPS are best friends.
