 Lie down and let the sound of the rain soothe you. If it is bedtime, drift asleep to the sound of the rain.;
, Don't open the window unless it is bearable; instead, cuddle up under your favorite quilt or blankets and listen to the sound of the rain on the roof. Yes, turn the TV off!

, Watch the raindrops as they create puddles, listen to the different tones, from the white noise of distant rain to the more melodic large drops that hit puddles when running off the roof. Especially breathe deep, taking in the freshness of the air that only a fresh rainfall provides.
 Let them splash around in the puddles and rain (Bring your own rubber boots and join in if you want to feel like a kid again). They can take their rubber ducks and bath toys with them, or they can try to spot where the animals have hidden from the rain (birds, squirrels, possums etc., whatever your part of the world has). If you have an anthill nearby, let them investigate what the ants are doing. Ask them if the ants come into your house earlier to warn you the rain was coming?

, Relax and breathe deeply. Ask others to appreciate the rain with you.
 It'll bring back memories and cheer you up.
 Get out the old puzzles and games; finish that long-forgotten sewing or woodwork project; read that novel; dance with your loved one on the living room floor.
 Apart from needing to take an umbrella or raincoat, once you're indoors again, you'll forget about the weather and you won't regret wasting sunshine.
