@article
 Greetings like "Hello" or "Good morning" are examples. Don't train it to say long sentences. For example: "I like ice cream and I want the ice cream truck to come over to my house so we can buy some." It might be too confusing.;
, You can make it compliment you--"(Insert Name Here) is awesome."

, Close the door so nobody comes in to disturb, or else the parrot will be confused about background noises.
 Speak a little bit slowly first. But don't feel frustrated if your parrot won't say it right. Don't shout at your parrot. It might take some time. You can continue training it the next day or you can just keep trying.
 Reward your parrot for all its hard work.
