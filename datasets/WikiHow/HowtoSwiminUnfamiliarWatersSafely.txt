 Pop into a local shop or restaurant and ask where the locals swim, where lifeguards supervise and ask for tide times.;
, You can ask locally or check for flying flags or signposts. Check out how much of the area is supervised and obey these rules.
 Always check with the lifeguard if it is safe to swim otherwise.
 Do not go in any deeper than your lower chest as you will be affected by any minor variations in water depth beyond this point. This depth of water is sufficient for swimming and playing.
 Be aware that the water depth may not be uniform and there may be sandbars, sudden drops or inshore holes.
 Always swim with at least one competent swimmer. Ideally swim together but, if you are strong swimmers, always stay within fifteen metres of each other, provided you can see each other clearly and hear one another. If you go by yourself, you could get stuck and you would have no one to help you get out.
 Feel the bottom with your feet so you are aware of rocks, sudden drops etc.
, You could be sucked over by the tide.
