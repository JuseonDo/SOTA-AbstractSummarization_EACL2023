@summary
examine exploding volcanoes and colliding of continents, folding and breaking... you know that natures greatest building projects like mountains are created by destructive power.

@summary
look at how nature breaks down things and think about whether creation of life seems natural!,

@summary
point out that the most basic "natural" scientific processes called entropy and chaos do not normally improve things: so how did cell molecular organization of life just "happen" (please see the image with a chart.

@summary
entropy is disorder or uncertainty in a system and much like inertia it is neutral and only exists because of outside forces.

@summary
equilibrium apparently has no creative energies or powers, and so entropy could do little or nothing but come to a balanced or settled condition (as, by definition, energy is not available to do work by entropy).

@summary
examine the creativity of a great booming explosion, "boom" (a big boom).

@summary
visualize the big bang.

@summary
contemplate, how and if all life came into existence as the result of "a" big bang, where did that big bang come from?
@article
, The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in closed systems unless external energy is used to "clean it up", similar to how cleaning up a room requires your energy. Entropy, for the most part, means disorder. An example is about breaking down rocks to pebbles and to sand, dissolving, oxidizing, mineral deposits, poison, corrosion, erosion, and rot. Evolution depends on disorder such as mutations but then devolves to order, which is in contrast of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. While some may use escape hatches, such as that the organisms themselves are not closed systems, or that the Earth is not a closed system because it gets energy from the sun, the Sun is not intelligently affecting the Earth in a meaningful way, unlike a person cleaning up a room. Evolution is not surely proven because nothing in science will ever be proven, as the scientific method means that a better alternative to evolution may be found. God can override laws as he wishes, after all, He made laws but is not bound or limited by them.

, Entropy merely resolves to equilibrium.,, How much creativity was in that -- over eons of time, settling to equilibrium.
 Massive force so great it's not over yet? The universe is said to still be expanding from that explosion.
 What went boom? Where did that object come from? So how many competing "big bangs" are there out there right now? How do you know?


Obviously there is something much bigger than our known "expanding universe".
