Renting the right ozone generator will make the process more effective. While exact figures are not well-established, a generator rated at 3500mg/h is probably the bare minimum to do an effective shock treatment on a mid-sized car. Larger vehicles may require a more powerful generator. Units up to 12000 mg/h have been used effectively and safely. It is essential that the unit be compatible with a flexible duct.;
, Take everything out of the car, including the spare tire. Anything left behind could potentially be damaged or discolored by the ozone.
, Some ozone machines will come with the duct, but any dryer duct will do. Duct tape may be helpful.
 The ozone generator should remain outside the vehicle to allow it access to fresh air.
 The idea is to seal up the car to prevent the ozone from escaping the vehicle.
 No one should be in the car during this process. No animals should be in the car during this process.


Do not run the generator longer than the recommended time.
 The slight ozone smell is normal and will disappear completely after three or four days. If necessary, repeat the ozone shock treatment after airing out the vehicle.
