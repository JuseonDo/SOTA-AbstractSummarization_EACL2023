@summary
talk with your child and discover what they think they need in the "spy base".

@summary
gather the wood and other materials needed to build the base.

@summary
a spy base needs four walls, a secret entrance, an observation platform, and a way to view outside to see if dangerous enemy spies are present.

,

@summary
have your james bond or nancy drew choose the location (in your backyard).

@summary
build a simple framework to attach the walls to.

@summary
attach the walls to the frame, except on one side.

@summary
the remaining side should have a hidden door.

@summary
place a roof on top of the structure that will keep out the weather but allow observation or the launching of missiles (water balloons).

@summary
build a platform inside the base that will allow "observations" through the top of the base.

@summary
drill holes in the walls to allow those inside to monitor if enemy spies are approaching.

@summary
such a building can also be built entirely makeshift.

Check around and see if you can get some scrap wood from a construction site. Otherwise, you'll have to buy it.
, Against a wooden fence is best (Only three walls to build and the fence can help support the structure.)


If the child is old enough to assist, by all means allow the child to do so. He/she will enjoy the structure much more if he helps to build it. If his friends are interested, let them help too. Children want to build things themselves. You should assist with jobs involving saws, drills, etc., but they should do as much as possible.
 Always consider whether the framework you have is sufficient. If necessary, add to the framework to keep it safe.


You will need at least one square frame to attach the plywood to. You will need two if you are building a freestanding structure.
If you are attaching the spy base to a wooden fence, Nail two 2x4 joists to the fence base (the part the planks are nailed to). One square frame will be needed for the front of the structure.
If the spy base is freestanding, you will need two square frames to attach the walls to.



The walls do not have to be plywood, but need to be durable enough to withstand the elements.
 The door should be hinged on the inside of the base (We wouldn't want those enemies knowing how to get in). Drill a hole large enough to put a finger through (without getting stuck) so the door can be pulled open.



One way to allow outside "observation" is by leaving a gap between the top of walls and the roof.
 Add extra supports as this will be stood on, if not built too high, the platform can also double as seating. You could build the platform around the inside perimeter.
, The imagination of the builder is the biggest limit.
