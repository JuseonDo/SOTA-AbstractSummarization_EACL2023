 When doing this trick, you can charge up your gas and hold it off until the race begins. This way, you can get an early boost in the race without even drifting, snaking, or moving at all, and get ahead of those behind and ahead of you at the start-up line.  From Mario Kart Wii and onwards, start holding accelerate about 2 seconds before the race starts.  Too late, and nothing happens; too early, and you'll burn out!
, When he appears, he will do the usual countdown before the race begins to prepare you for the upcoming lap. Make sure you start this trick here as doing it too early or too late will either make your kart not boost at all, or it will even make it slow down and get stuck in your current position., As soon as you see the 2 appear on the screen and Lakitu making a beeping noise, immediately press it now!, message appears on the screen and Lakitu shines the green light, let go of the button to do a boost! Just let go of the acceleration button when the race truly begins to boost a head-start and beat other racers behind and ahead of you!
