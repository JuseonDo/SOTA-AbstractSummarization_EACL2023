 A shared printer is a printer that is connected to one of the computers on your network, and then made available to others. The computer that the printer is connected to must be powered on in order to print to it. Almost any printer can be shared on the network.
 Follow the steps in the first section to install the USB printer as you normally would.


Use this method if you are using Windows XP, Windows Vista, or a mix of many different versions of Windows on your network.
The computer that you install the printer on will need to be powered on whenever another computer on the network wants to print to it.
 You will need to ensure that File and Print sharing is enabled.
,, Click Save changes.
,,, Give it a name and click Apply.
,,, Windows will look for available shared printers.
 You may be prompted to install the drivers. If Windows can't find the drivers, you can download them from the printer manufacturer's website.
 Once the printer has been installed, you'll be able to print to it just as if it was plugged directly into your computer. The computer that the printer is connected to must be turned on and logged into Windows in order to connect to it.
