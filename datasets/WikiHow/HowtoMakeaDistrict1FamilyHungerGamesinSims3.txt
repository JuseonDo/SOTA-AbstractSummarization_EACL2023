 Some ideas are Gold, Goldberg, Goldwater, Silver, or Copper. All members of this family must be athletic and toned, as District 1 trains people for the Hunger Games. All athletic outfits must be camouflage colors (for the Hunger Games arena).;
, Give him either blond or red hair. Facial hair is up for grabs. Dress him in clothes that would fit the district. Use the traits Family-Oriented, Athletic, Loves the Outdoors, Artistic and Brave.
 Give her an elaborate hairstyle, and use the flashiest jewelry you can get. Give her a dress as her everyday outfit. Use the traits Family-Oriented, Athletic, Artistic, Neat and another of your choice.
 She, too, must have an elaborate hairstyle and the flashiest jewelry possible. Use subdued makeup (think Glimmer). Think what a District 1 tribute would wear to the Tribute Parade, and imitate that for her everyday outfit. Use the traits Athletic, Artistic, Snob (because she would be a Career Tribute) and either Mean Spirited or Evil.
 Remember, District 1 is the richest district, being right next to the Capitol. You may need to use "motherlode" several times for this.
, This would be more District 4 than District 1.
, A District 1 adult would be a businessperson making and selling jewelry and other luxury items.


As an alternative, you can choose the Professional Sports career track. District 1 residents, being trained for the Hunger Games, are very fit.
 This enables them to cook rich foods.
