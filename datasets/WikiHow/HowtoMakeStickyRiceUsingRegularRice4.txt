, For best results, try to use a short-grain rice type.Short-grain rice tends to be starchier than medium or long-grain rice by nature, so it might give your better results.

Popular medium-grain rice varieties include jasmine and basmati.
 Reduce the heat to medium-low. Be sure to keep an eye on your pot so that it doesn't boil over., Stir everything together with a spoon to combine. You will be using this to season your rice.

To save time, consider doing this while the rice is cooking.
 Be sure to stir the mixture from time to time. This will prevent it from getting scorched., When the rice has finished cooking, take the rice pot off the stove and remove the cover. Pour the coconut milk mixture into the rice, and stir it using a fork or spatula., Put the cover back on the rice pot, and place the pot some place where it won't be disturbed. This will give the rice enough time to soak up the flavors from the coconut milk mixture., Stir everything together with a spoon. This will be your sauce. If you don't have any tapioca starch, you can also use cornstarch or arrowroot powder instead., Be sure to stir the sauce from time to time so that it doesn't curdle or scorch., Start by peeling the mango. If your mango is ripe enough, you should be able to nick the skin with your knife, then pull the skin off. Once you have the mango peeled, cut it in half and remove the seed. Cut the mango into thin slices. Repeat this step for the other two mangoes., You can create more servings than just four, but the portions will be smaller., You can set them down right next to the rice, or on top of the rice. If you are placing the slices on top of the rice, to overlap them to create a fan-like shape., If you want, you can also sprinkle some sesame seeds on top of the sauce.

Keep in mind that, because you are not using sticky rice, the texture may not be quite the same as in the traditional dish.
