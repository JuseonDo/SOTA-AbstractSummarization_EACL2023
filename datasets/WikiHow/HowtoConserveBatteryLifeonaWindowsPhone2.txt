 There is an option in Windows Phone to use either the light theme or a dark theme. Setting a light theme will have black text over white base, whereas dark theme has white text over black base. If you use the light theme, the white base uses more battery when compared to a dark theme. If you're on the light theme, you might want to switch to the dark one.
