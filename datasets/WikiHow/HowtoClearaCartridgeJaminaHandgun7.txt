@summary
understand that true jams almost never occur with a revolver.

@summary
note that double and single action revolvers have a mechanism to cycle the cylinder and to align it with the barrel before firing.

 If you experience one, you can tap the stuck round out of the cylinder (carefully, especially if it is an unfired round). You will probably find either a very dirty or corroded cartridge or chamber, or the incorrect caliber round.
 If the cylinder fails to revolve, you probably need to carry the weapon to a qualified gunsmith for mechanical repairs.
