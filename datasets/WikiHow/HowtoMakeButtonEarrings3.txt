 These kits usually include a set or two of metal buttons as well as two plastic pieces. These plastic pieces are meant to help you put your buttons together.Save the packaging! It usually has a template for the fabric.
 Set the button backs aside when you are done.
 If your kit did not come with a template, or if you accidentally threw it away, draw a circle roughly twice the size of your button top.


Some templates are shaped like a semi-circle. In this case, fold your fabric in half, and place the straight edge of the semi-circle along the fold.
The best fabric to use for this is cotton fabric. It can be plain or patterned.
 Try to be as neat as you can. Because of the small size you are working in, any small mistakes will have a big effect on the final product.
 This will make assembling the button easier. Be sure to leave a long tail of thread and the needle still attached so that you can pull on it to gather the fabric later.
 This is the larger of the two plastic pieces. Try to center the fabric as much as possible.
 Push it down until it rests firmly inside the button maker.
 The fabric should now be gathered around the inside of the button. Stitch in place a few times, then tie the thread off into a knot, and snip it. This will keep the fabric in place for the next step.
 If you need to, place the button cover tool (the other piece from your button making kit) on top, then tap it firmly with a hammer. Lift the button cover tool away when you are done.

If you don't have pierced ears, use clip-on earring backings instead.
 How long the glue takes to dry depends on the type of glue you are using. Some only take a few minutes to dry, while others require a few hours. Refer to your glue bottle for specific drying times. Once the glue has dried, your earrings are ready to wear!
