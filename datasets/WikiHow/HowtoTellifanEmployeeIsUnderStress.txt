 You can recognize this in the extent of errors that you are finding, in addition to the type of errors. Only you would recognize whether the mistakes are out of character.
 Maybe he is unnecessarily short in his responses to your queries or he loses patience easily. But any form of jittery behavior should not be ignored.
, Maybe his usual extroverted personality has gotten quiet and reserved, or his optimism has turned into a strange cynicism.
