, The suction cup must have a keyring handle, and measure approximately 1.75 inches (4.44 cm) in diameter. The suction cup will help you with removing the glass panel up and off the iPhone.
 Your iPhone 3GS will now be opened.


Proceed with the following steps if your goal is to access the logic board or replace the screen.
 The three cables are located at the top right corner of the iPhone and labeled with round orange stickers.


Place the spudger just underneath each cable, and gently pry each cable upward.
 Your iPhone will now be separated into two halves.
 This will allow you to access and replace the screen. After the screws are removed, the screen can be gently lifted out of the device.Skip this step if you do not need to replace the screen of your iPhone 3GS.
 This sticker exists as a warning to users who service their own iPhones, since making changes to the logic board could render the device useless or void the manufacturer’s warranty.
 You will now have access to all working components of your iPhone, including its processor, RAM, and battery.
