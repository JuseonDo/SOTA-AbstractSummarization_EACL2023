, This brush is most effective at erasing large backgrounds. If working with smaller images and backgrounds, experiment with using a different brush style.
 Select “Continuous” if erasing multiple colors in the background, or select “Once” if removing a background with one or two colors., This feature allows you to remove the background while preserving the sharpness of edges in your picture.
 A low tolerance level is ideal for erasing one to two colors, while a high tolerance level erases a larger amount of colors. For example, if erasing the blue background of a sky, set your tolerance level between 20 and 25 percent for the best results., For example, if removing a tree behind a vehicle, position the pointer near the edge of the vehicle. The pointer will turn into a circle with crosshairs at its center.
 Take care not to drag the crosshairs over the edges of the object against the background, since this erases part of your image.


Use a smaller brush size to remove the background from small, tight areas between the object and background.
