 The measuring tape should rest where your bra band rests. Keep the tape smooth and parallel to the floor.
 This number is your band size.
 Usually, the tape measure should cross over your nipples. Keep the tape measure parallel to the floor. Do not allow it to become slack but do not keep it too tight, either. This number is your bust size.
 Add a cup size for every inch (2.5cm). For example, a difference of one inch (2.5cm) puts you in an A cup, a difference of two inches (5cm) puts you in a B cup, a difference of three inches (7.5cm) puts you in a C cup, a difference of four inches (10cm) puts you in a D cup, and a difference of five inches (12.5cm) puts you in a DD or E cup. If the difference is less than one inch (2.5cm), you should wear an AA cup.
 The cups should contain your breasts and the center of your nipple should fall in the fullest part of the cup.


If your breasts brim over the cup in the middle or at the sides, the bra is too small.
If the bra fabric is pinched together in places and not filled in by flesh, the bra is too large.
 Neither the band nor the straps should dig into your skin but both should fit snugly and lie flat.
 This center piece of fabric should lay flat against the breastbone.
