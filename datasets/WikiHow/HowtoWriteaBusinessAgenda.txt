 At this time you may make any general announcements pertinent to the meeting or meeting space before moving forward.;
, During the meeting, the secretary and treasurer reports should be officially approved by the group.
 If your company or board has departments or divisions, each group should be given their own portion of the agenda to bring up two or three relevant items regarding past or ongoing business issues. Progress of each issue should be reported, and time should be provided for any questions and further explanations.
 Again, each division or department should have an opportunity to inform the board or group about upcoming projects or efforts. This may be the time to ask for involvement, volunteers or other forms of participation or support. Time should be allowed for questions and follow-up answers.
 This is typically called "Open Forum." During this time, new concerns or ideas can be addressed in an orderly manner. The chairperson conducting the meeting must recognize, or officially call upon, an attendee before she begins her open forum discussion.
 At the time of adjourning, a new meeting date should be set. This pre-planned date should appear on the agenda. If it needs to be changed, the new date can be reflected in the minutes.
