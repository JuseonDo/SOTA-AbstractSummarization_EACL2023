, The body should be a bit smaller and should be rounded and then made a bit more skinny

, This is easy. All you have to do is make a stubby little clay cylinder 4 times. Then stick the legs tight to your cat's body.
 If you have made it here your halfway done! Good job.
 Names like Rusty and Firepaw are great coming from the book. Other than that, names like Mustache cat are common along with similar silly names.
 Make more cats, and give them names. Also, for bonus make mice maybe, or food.
 If you have already made this or do not want to make this, go to the next step. You will need large amounts of clay and paint. Construct trees, lakes, fish, berry bushes, foxes, wolves, caves, rocks and more out of the clay and paint.
