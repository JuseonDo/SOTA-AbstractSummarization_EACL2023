This is mostly up to personal preference, but factors such as opened doors and stud placement should be considered when choosing a location.;

A stud is the wood framing that comprises the inner structure of the walls. It's essential to find a stud when putting up shelves because shelves drilled into dry wall are not well supported and will collapse.
 Mark it with a pencil.


Studs are usually placed every 16 to 24 inches (40.62 cm to 60.96 cm) apart. Ideally you want to put up shelves with the incorporation of at least two studs. If your shelves are shorter than the distance between two studs, you will want to use one stud as a center point for your shelves.
 Decide on the height of the shelves.



If you are putting up shelves at more than 1 height, make sure to make marks for that as well.
 Draw a straight horizontal line to the next stud.


Repeat this step for the shelves at other heights.
, Screw the 2-inch (5.08 cm) wood screws in so that the bracket fits tightly.


Repeat this step for the other studs and other shelves. Use your level to guarantee the brackets are aligned.
, Adjust to level.
 Use 1/2-inch (1.27 cm)wood screws.
