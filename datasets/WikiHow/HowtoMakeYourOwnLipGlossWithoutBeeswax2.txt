 Use as much as you wish to make lip balm (at least a tablespoon, up to four tablespoons). Remember that more petroleum jelly makes a sheerer balm and less petroleum jelly makes the color a bit more visible.
 Add it slowly until you obtain the desired color.


Optional: Make many lip balms of varied colors. Clean out a small makeup palette (for children) and use the palette tray for molding the differently colored balms.
 If it is not fully blended, the lip balm will not work.
 Microwave for 10 seconds and no longer. It should not be melted, just soft and warm.
, It will now be ready for use.
