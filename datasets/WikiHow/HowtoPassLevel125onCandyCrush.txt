 Level 125 has jelly squares placed in all corners of the board, which can be difficult to access.;
, The licorice blockers in level 125 cannot be wiped from afar using special candies such as wrapped candies, striped candies, or color bombs, but can be clicked on and switched with other nearby candies., Licorice blockers and two-layer icing may prevent you from being able to access most double jelly squares in level 125.
 Although licorice blockers are resistant to special candies, these candies can help you clear the remaining double jelly squares from the board.Create color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row. A color bomb detonates all candies on the board of the same color you match it with.
Create striped candies by matching four candies of the same color in a row. A striped candy wipes out all candies in the same row either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.
Create wrapped candies by matching five candies of the same color in an L shape, T shape, or + shape. A wrapped candy clears out the surrounding eight candies after detonation.
 Special candies can detonate nearby licorice blockers, but will not clear any other candies past the licorice blockers., These special candy combos can help wipe several jelly squares from the board at the same time -- including candies in corners that are difficult to access -- and increase your odds for passing level 125.
