 Choose carrots that are very fresh and don't have any blemishes. The sweeter their flavour, the more enjoyable they will be when chargrilled.
 Dry them off or allow them to dry before proceeding., Be careful when cutting, as the carrot can easily slip. Keep the slices as thin as possible. Lightly oil the carrot slices using a pastry brush., If it isn't non-stick, brush with a little vegetable oil. Place on the stovetop. Cook the first side of the carrots, then turn over and cook the other side.
