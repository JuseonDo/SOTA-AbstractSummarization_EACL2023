 Select a bright, hot pink for the base coat and then pick up a bottle of white and black polish. You will be creating a small bow at the top of each skull so for that extra glamour, add a small nail faux diamond.
 For this manicure, two coats is a must for the bright pink color to be prominently displayed.
 You could paint these adorable skulls on each nail, however if you really want to make them pop and be noticed, select just two on each finger. The rest of the nails can hold a small heart at the tip.
 While the paint is still wet, extend the circle by painting a small rectangle underneath it. The rectangle will be the skullâ€™s mouth.
 Create two small dots for the skulls eyes in the middle of the large, white circle you painted. Use a toothpick or a nail art stripper to create the teeth by painting three straight lines down the middle of the rectangle. Draw the bow using black nail polish on the side of the skulls head using a toothpick or nail art stripper and add a small faux diamond in the middle of the bow using nail glue.
 If your hand is steady, paint the heart using the polish brush. Otherwise create a small, slanted oval and then paint another small slanted oval next to it, making sure the ends touch.
 You may want to add two layers of top coat to encase the small diamonds and the complex design.
