 Be sure to wash off all debris no matter how small, especially oil grease.;

Fiberglass can release glass dust into the air when sanded, which is dangerous to inhale and can irritate skin.
To prevent this, wet the areas of the chair you're about to sand with water as you go. The water will trap the dust and keep it out of the air .
, Let it dry.


If you're using the recommended paint sprayer, fill the sprayer's tank with your primer mixture and spray on the chair from there.
If you're stuck using a paint brush, just dip and prime.
, Now you're ready to paint!

, Let the paint dry, then repeat the process.


Apply 2 to 3 coats.
If you're using the paint sprayer wash the primer out of it first.
 Use the sprayer if you have it or the brush if your don't.


Penetrol is an effective and widely available top coat option in the US .
Be especially careful if using a brush for this step. Brush marks made here will be painfully visible.
