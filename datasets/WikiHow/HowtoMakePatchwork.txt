 This will act as a stencil to make sure that all your patchwork pieces are the same size.;
, To do this, place the sample plate on top of paper liner. Mark with a pencil and cut.
 Mark an area of 6 mm around paper liner; this will allow space for the seam. Pin it and cut with scissors.
 Stitch it roughly to hold it together temporarily, and press with iron to keep neat. Repeat the process for other pieces.
 You'll be joining them so that the edges match up and the pieces are facing the same way.
 Avoid stitching the lining paper.
 When the first two pieces are attached, you should be able to fold them over and see something like this, with slip stitches along the connecting edge and other edges free to have more patchwork pieces sewn to them.
 Remove the temporary stitches to remove the paper liner. Pressed with iron for neatness.
