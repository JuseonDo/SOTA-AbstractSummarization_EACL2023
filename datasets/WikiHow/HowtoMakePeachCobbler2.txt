, The heat of the oven will melt the butter while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
 Set the peaches aside when you are done.

If you do end up using the canned peaches, make sure that you drain them well. Save the juice for another recipe, or discard it.
 Pour everything into a large mixing bowl, then stir briskly until evenly combined., Keep stirring until the yolk breaks, and everything is evenly mixed together. There should be no streaks or swirls of milk, egg white, or egg yolk.
 Using some oven mitts, take the baking dish out of the oven, and set it down on a heat-safe surface. Pour the batter over it, but do not stir.
 Keep the bowl close to the baking dish, so that the peaches don't splatter when they drop. Once again, do not stir the cobbler.


For extra texture, sprinkle 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of sugar over the top of the cobbler. The sugar will caramelize, and give the cobbler a nice, crispy texture., The cobbler is ready when the batter rises and turns golden-brown at top.If the cobbler still is not ready, continue to bake it for 10 more minutes., It tastes great on its own, or alongside some cream or vanilla ice cream.
