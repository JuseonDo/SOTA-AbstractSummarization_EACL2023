start by getting in the proper position.

 They should have their arms bent a little bit and up above their head. Their hands should be spread and their wrists should be bent backward. You should keep their legs shoulder width apart and slightly bent. Lastly, they should keep their back arched.
 A strong adult should put one hand on the child's stomach and the other hand on their back, this will prevent them from falling headfirst into the ground.The adult should keep their hands their until the child has successfully completed the backbend.
 It is really all about keeping your form all the way through and trusting yourself.
