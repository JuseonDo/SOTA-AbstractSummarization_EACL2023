 If you aren't already on it, then join your school's track team. Those workouts will get you in good shape.;
,, If you haven't ran a 1500 before, either double your 800 time, subtract 20 or so seconds from your mile time, or cut in half and subtract 40 seconds from your 3000 time. These are just approximate times though, as every person is different.
 Look on a race pace guide to find out where you want to be at at 400, 800, and 1200 meters.
 Imagine yourself running quickly but easily, with good form and breathing. Also picture yourself running the split times that you wanted to.
, Tell yourself that you are prepared for this race.
, Make sure you add in a surge thereâ€”you can also try to sprint up to catch the next person. Make sure you do this even though it might seem to soon, but if you don't you'll run a far slower race.
 It helps to just concentrate on running 100 meters, then you just have a lap and a half left.
 Concentrate on just catching up to the person in front of you, and passing them.
 If you aren't already, you should be sprinting by now. Block out all the pain, and remind yourself that everybody else is just as tired as you are.
 Future careers are made and broken here, and you don't want to ever be saying "What if?" about the race.
