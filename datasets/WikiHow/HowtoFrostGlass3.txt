 Attach it with a removable type of tape, such as painter's tape or masking tape.
 Keep in mind that complex designs will be difficult to create with frosting spray, though it is possible with a lot of time and patience.
 Use a razor knife to cut out the design, making sure to leave the outline intact.


Keep in mind when cutting that you are creating a large stencil so you will want an inverted image.
 This will prevent any dirt smudges or flakes from appearing in your design.


If your window has a filmy coating, clean it with vinegar first in order to strip away the oils. Window frosting spray will not stick to a window that is oily.
 Make sure it is positioned exactly where you want the design to be.


Tape around the perimeter of the stencil to create a strong hold. If the stencil should slip when the window frosting spray is drying, it will cause the image to smear.
 The closer you are to the glass, the thicker and darker the frosting will be.


If you are using multiple colors in the design, spray the colors one at a time and allow each one to dry before spraying the next color.



You can speed up the drying process by directing a fan at the window, making sure it is on the low setting to prevent the stencil from shifting.
 Slowly peel off the tape while holding the stencil in place to prevent it from sliding across the image. Lift the stencil off the glass in a fluid motion.
