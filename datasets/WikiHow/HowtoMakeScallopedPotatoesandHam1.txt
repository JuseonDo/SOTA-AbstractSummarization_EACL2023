, Stir the onion occasionally to help it cook evenly. You will be ready for the next step when the onion turns tender.
 Add the four, salt, and pepper, and stir it briskly with a whisk. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens and turns smooth and bubbly.
 Remove the saucepan from heat first, then slowly stir in the milk with a whisk. Keep whisking until the milk is evenly mixed in. Removing the saucepan from the heat first will prevent the milk from cooking too quickly.
 Stir the mixture constantly as it cooks to prevent scorching and a skin forming on top. Once it is cooked, take it off the heat and set it aside.
 If you have not already, scrub the potatoes clean, peel them, and cut them into thin slices, about ⅛-inch (0.32 centimeters) thick.Combine the sliced potatoes with the cooked, cubed ham in the casserole dish.
 You don't have to stir the sauce into the potatoes, but you can if you want to. Once you have the sauce in, cut the butter or margarine into small cubes, and sprinkle it over the potatoes. This will give it extra richness.
 You can cover the potatoes with the lid that came with your casserole dish, or you can use a sheet of tin foil. The potatoes are ready when they turn soft and tender, and the top turns golden. If they are not ready yet, let them bake for another 10 minutes.
 This allows the sauce to not only cool, but also to thicken and become creamier. After this, you can serve them with your favorite dish.
