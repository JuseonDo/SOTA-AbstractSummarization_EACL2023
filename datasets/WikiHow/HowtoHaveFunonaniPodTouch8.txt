 All the icons will jiggle and an "x" will appear on the top left of icons that did not come pre-loaded by Apple. Touch the "x" to delete an icon/app. Touch and drag the icon to rearrange its position on that screen or drag it to another screen. Touch and drag an icon atop another icon and you'll create a single icon that contains a group showing the individual apps. For example, drag Angry Birds onto Doodle Jump and you'll have a single icon called "games" with both apps grouped inside that icon. You can also drag an icon/app out of the group and return it to the regular menu. To stop the jiggling icons and return to the regular screen, tap the main button at the bottom center of the device.
