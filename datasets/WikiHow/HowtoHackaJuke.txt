Click Convert.
Press 'play clip'. The purple bar is where the clip starts and the red is where it ends. This process may take a while. Don't be alarmed if the screen freezes; this is normal so give it a few minutes.
Ignore the error message indicating the file is too big hit 'Ok'.
Change the phone type to 'Other CDMA phone' through Edit, Settings. This will allow you to connect your phone and thus upload the songs.
