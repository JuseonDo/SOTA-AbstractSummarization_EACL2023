 Line the muffin pan with paper cases., Melt over hot water, then allow to cool slightly., Stir gently to ensure complete coverage of the cornflakes., Fill so that the cornflakes rise out of the cases in a mound., Push 2 to 3 miniature eggs into the "nest". This step is optional; the "nests" can be enjoyed without eggs too., When they're ready, simply remove from the muffin pan and arrange on a serving plate.
