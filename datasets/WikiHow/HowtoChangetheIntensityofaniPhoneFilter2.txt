, If you're using the "Albums" view, you'll have to tap an album to open it first.
 This is the set of horizontal lines with sliders at the bottom of your screen.
 It's the circle icon surrounded by dots at the bottom of your screen.
 The "Color" button is for photos with a color filter, while the "B&W" button covers black and white photos.
 It's at the bottom of the screen. Swiping to the left increases your filter's intensity, while swiping to the right decreases it.
 This will save your changes.
