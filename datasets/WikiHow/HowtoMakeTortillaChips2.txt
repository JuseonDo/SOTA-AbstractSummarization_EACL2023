 Use a neutral oil, such as vegetable, grapeseed, or canola oil.
 Oil that is heated to below 325° F will not produce browned or charred tortilla chips. Although frying the tortilla chips at 325° F will mean a longer frying time, it produces the most consistent results.


If you want to heat the oil up to 350° F (177° C) or higher, expect to cook the tortilla for less time and be vigilant against browning or burning. If you decide to cook your tortilla chips at 350° F, check them for doneness at around the 45 second to one minute mark.If you don't have a candy- or other thermometer to check the temperature of the oil, use the back end of a wooden spoon. Dip the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles just start to form, your oil is probably hot enough., There's little need to flip them or move them around.
, Salting immediately after removal is best, since the salt sticks to the excess oil on the chip, adhering better.
 If not serving, store in an airtight container. Homemade tortilla chips are particularly susceptible to getting stale if not stored properly.
