 You really need to know what's going on before you start telling everyone you are a Lord of the Rings Fan. The books are long, but it's worth it. The books are:


The Hobbit
The Fellowship of the Ring
The Two Towers
The Return of the King;
, Take notes--on paper or in your head--of the similarities and differences of the books and movies. Ask yourself why they may have left certain parts out or embellished upon an aspect of the story, such as Liv Tyler's character Arwen.
 This is an optional step since some people view it as creepy. It's up to you to decide if "merch" collecting is a big part of fandom.
 A forum is an excellent way to communicate with others about your feelings on a particular the book. Discuss them and try to get inside J.R.R. Tolkien's head as you read. If it helps, draw a simple map after reading through the book a second time. Try to follow Frodo's journey to rid the Middle Earth of "The One Ring".
 It is Bilbo Baggins' story 60 years before The Lord of the Rings  takes place. It is in The Hobbit that Bilbo acquires the Ring.
 It is the history of Middle-earth, written by J.R.R. and Christopher Tolkien.
 It is a twelve volume series of the history of the development of the world of Middle-earth, written by J.R.R. Tolkien.
 These books include:

The Adventures of Tom Bombadil
The Road Goes Ever On
Pictures by J.R.R Tolkien
Unfinished Tales
Bilbo's Last Song
The Children of Húrin

,, All the characters names are exotic. You may not be able to keep up. Try searching online for characters' names and dig into the character and it's history. This is helpful because people will be convinced you know more than Frodo and Gandalf.
