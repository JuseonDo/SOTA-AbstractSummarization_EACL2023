 Spend a few minutes resting, and then get up and begin to get ready.
 Make sure you look your best, but don't worry too much about it.
 If you have a school uniform, put it on neatly. If you go to a school without a uniform, wear something comfortable, yet stylish. Make sure everything is ironed and neat & clean.
 Don't eat too much for your first day, but eat enough that you won't be starving during your first few classes.Eat something healthy like fruits or a glass of milk or both.. Remember to pack a lunch if it's needed.
 Get your school bag and pack pens, pencils, math instruments, notebooks, books, or anything else you might need for your school day.
 Play it cool throughout the day, and relax as you get to know your way around and meet everyone.
