get an idea in your head of what kind of mosaic you would like to make.

@summary
head over to your local hardware or floor store and select and buy the tiles you would like to use.

@summary
with your safety glasses and protective gloves on, throw your tiles at any hard object, or simply drop them.

@summary
gather your broken tiles into color categories.

@summary
now it comes time to make the mosaic.

take your pieces and slide them into the wooden frame (if not already there).

@summary
once the tiles have set, mix up the cement with water until it is of the consistency described on the cement bag (liquid but not runny).

@article
 Sketch a basic drawing of what you would like it to look like when it finishes. This can be as detailed as you want, but it just has to give you a guide.

, This includes color and texture, or anything that you like. You could also go dumpster diving to find old tiles. These should be ceramic. (If your mosaic will be used where it may be subjected to freezing temperatures, the tiles should be porcelain that is frost resistant.) You may want to purchase a tile cutter if you are looking for a dramatic, organized mosaic with square pieces. You should also buy some tile adhesive and cement.
 In order to avoid major scratches, lay a thin comforter over the ground. Or score and cut with the tile cutter. These are great stress relievers and they don't hurt anyone.
 This will help you when the time comes to actually put them into place.
 When you have all of your broken tile pieces, lay them onto the surface that you will decorate. Again, this can be anything at all.
 They might scatter a little, but if you are careful, it should not be too bad. Slide the attempted escapees back into place.
, Now put the cement/water mix over all the tiles.
