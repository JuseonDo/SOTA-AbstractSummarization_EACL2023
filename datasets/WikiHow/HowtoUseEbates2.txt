 Even if you do some research on the product you want ahead of time, the best thing is to open a new window, sign into Ebates and follow a single link through to your shopping cart and purchase, instead of using tabs. Your purchase will not qualify for cash back if you don’t use the Ebates link to make your purchase.
 When your shopping is done and you go to checkout, enter the codes in the coupon field. Then, enter your credit card details and make your purchase.
 You will be eligible to receive your cash back via PayPal transfer or check each quarter. Refunds and returns will result in money being subtracted from your cash back tab.
 After making an order, you should get a confirmation and an Ebates tracking number to inform you that you made a qualifying purchase.


Most purchases are tracked and credited within 48 hours., Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer all offer a toolbar extension that helps pick up on sites that are available on Ebates. When the Ebates cash back button informs you of potential cash back, you can sign into your Ebates account and make the qualifying purchase through their link.
