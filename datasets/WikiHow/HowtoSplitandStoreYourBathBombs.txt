 Carefully place the bath bomb in the corner of the bag, with the seam facing up toward you. If your bath bomb doesn’t have a seam, it may be more difficult to split., Ensure you are working on a flat, sturdy surface. If your cutting board is slipping around, place a damp towel underneath it to keep it in place., You could ask a friend to hold the bath bomb while you split it.


If your bath bomb is flat rather than spherical, try carefully cutting it in half with a knife. If your bath bomb doesn’t have a seam or is an unwieldy shape, you can crush it with a hammer and split the pieces into two bags.
 Keep tapping until the bath bomb splits down the center. Be careful not to smash your fingers. If it crumbles, keep the pieces to toss into your bath.
 Tie a knot right above the bath bomb and use scissors to cut off the excess part of the bag. Alternatively, you can wrap each half in plastic wrap., Don’t put more than one bath bomb half in a plastic bag. Not only will they be more likely to bump against each other and break down, but you’ll have to cut open the bag to get one half of the bath bomb, then reseal the bag with other half.
 Put your individually-wrapped bath bombs in a plastic air-tight container or a mason jar with a lid. Store them in a bathroom cabinet or closet to keep them away from heat, light, and moisture., Though they may be gorgeous and look like works of art, you shouldn’t display your bath bombs, even if they are in plastic bags. Putting them on display can lead to oxidation, which makes the fizzy bath bombs lose their fizzing ability when added to water.
