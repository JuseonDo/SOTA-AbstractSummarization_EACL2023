 A good brand to use is called "Popcorn Weaver". Get popcorn without butter, which can make the string or yarn slippery.;
, The thinner the yarn or string, the easier it will be to string. The color doesn't matter since the popcorn will cover it up.
 Triple knot it just to be safe.
 Find a flat space on the piece; sometimes you'll find a natural hole.
