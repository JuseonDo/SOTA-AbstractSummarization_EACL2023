 If you use a mouse, move your cursor to the upper-right corner of the desktop.,,,,,

,, Select the "Just remove my files" option if you are going to keep the computer for yourself. Choose "Clean the drive fully" if you are getting rid of the computer.


The full clean will take several hours to complete, but will securely erase all of your data.
 Your computer will reboot and begin resetting.
 This may take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, depending on your computer., If Windows 8 did not come installed on your system, you may be prompted to insert the disk. Use your Windows 8 installation disk if you have it, or your computer manufacturer's recovery disk. If you don't have a recovery disk, you can create one.
