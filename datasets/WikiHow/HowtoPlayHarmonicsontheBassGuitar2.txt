 This method involves holding down the strings in the usual manner and focus is on the picking hand. For ease of learning holding down the first fret of whichever string you choose will be the starting point.
 Previously the twelfth fret would produce the desired harmonic but due to the first fret being held down, it will now reside at the thirteenth. Place your picking hands thumb overtop the fret using the same basic rules from the previous method.
 Adjust your thumbs placement if needed.
 As in the previous method, once the desired harmonic is found practice releasing your finger after the string is plucked to allow it to ring out.
