,, As you do this, try to center your hands on the beam. Here are some tips to help you keep your balance:


Look at the middle of your hands.
Keep your legs are higher than your hands.
, To do this, don't forget to stay tight. Don't lean forward––instead, keep pushing up to stay balanced. Tighten your stomach too.



Center yourself.
Keep your legs in a wide straddle.
 To complete your mount, get into the squat position, and stand up.


Be aware that this mount might take a while to learn.
Always get a spot, especially if it's your first few times attempting this.
