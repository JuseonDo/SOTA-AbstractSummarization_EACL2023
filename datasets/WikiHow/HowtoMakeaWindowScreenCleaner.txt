 If you don't have any remnants lying about the home, ask a local carpet retailer for some.;
, Again, if you don't have any at home, ask for unwanted offcuts from the local hardware store. The blocks must be of a size that you can hold comfortably - probably about the size of a kitchen sponge.
,, Follow the drying time instructions on the glue.
 When it comes to cleaning the window screens. run the carpeted side of the block up and down the screen to remove all the gunk. You can dampen it if this helps remove the stuck-on dirt etc.
