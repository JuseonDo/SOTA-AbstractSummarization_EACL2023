 Use a marker to indicate the center of each wall and draw straight chalk lines connecting opposite walls.
 Start from the center point where the perpendicular chalk lines intersect out to the walls along each line.


Do not apply adhesive yet. Adjust the lines if more than one-half of the last row of panels needs to be cut.
 Use a notched trowel held at a 45-degree angle to apply enough adhesive on the subfloor for the area to be covered by the first parquet panel. Lay the first panel, aligning it with the chalk lines.
,


Holding each parquet panel at a 45-degree angle, align the tongue-and-grooves between the new panel and the adjacent panel already laid on the subfloor and tap into place with a rubber mallet. One the panels are aligned, lay the new panel into the adhesive. Repeat until all 8 parquet panels have been laid.
, Lay the last row of parquet panels.
