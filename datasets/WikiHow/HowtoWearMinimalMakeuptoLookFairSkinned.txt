 Scrub very hard after carefully massaging it carefully into your face and neck. For a short amount of time, exfoliation makes your skin seem brighter if you are tanned but were naturally fair before that.;
, Massage this in too.
 Squeeze some foundation cream of a light color, just once, into your palm and with a finger, spread it around a one-cm radius.
 If there is any left on the palms, rub your palms together.
 After that, do the same for your neck.


If there are any darker parts that you have not gotten to, this is the time to take a dab of make-up and distribute it. If your skin is still dark, rub more make-up between your palms and rub your palms evenly on your face.
 You must let the lotion dry first

, Take an eye-brow pencil and color in your eye-brows to their natural color. If your eye-brows are sticky, try stroking them with wet fingers first.
 You want to look fair, not pale. Pale does not look natural if it is done with the use of make-up.


The use of mascara promotes your skin to look fair in contrast to your eye-lashes if their natural color is dark. Use mascara, and eyeliner, on both your upper and lower lashes.
 This contrasts your skin tone even more.
