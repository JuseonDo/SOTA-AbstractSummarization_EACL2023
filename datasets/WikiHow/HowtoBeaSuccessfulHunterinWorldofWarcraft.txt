choosing your race should be your first step.

@summary
like most fresh characters, you are going to spend the first 4-5 levels just completing missions to get you ready for the next zone.

@summary
also, make sure you are keeping your training up on a level by level basis.

@summary
in the "second zone", you are going to have the opportunities to learn skills and professions for the first time.

@summary
at 10th level, you are given the missions to collect your first pet.

@summary
as you gain levels, so will your pet.

@summary
at upper levels, you gain the ability to set traps and even feign death to avoid mob attacks.

@summary
from here it is all about learning your craft and making the most out of your experience, so make the most of it and have fun.

 As a hunter, there are few advantages you will have as a start-up character, so your racial abilities should be something you strongly consider.;
, Take advantage of this time to build XP based on combat. When you go into an area, clean house. This will ensure that not only have you completed your missions, but that you have gained yourself the maximum amount of character buffing before you head toward your next "stage".
 As stated above, you have few advantages at this point in your career, so you need all the bonuses you can get.
 Chose wisely. Skills like First aid are always a bonus as are cooking and fishing and none of them count against your professions. You only have two professions to choose from, so make them count.
 DO NOTHING ELSE. GO THERE RIGHT AWAY!!! Get it done and get a pet to help you hunt and fight. You will notice your odds in a fight greatly improving.
 Soon, you will find them becoming formidable friends to have alongside you. Much like yourself, your pets will require some specialized training.


Talk to your local pet trainers on how to accomplish this task.
As they advance, they will get skill points to apply to their abilities as well, so keep watch.
 Start learning to use these abilities as soon as they are afforded you and you will easily be able to take on enemies upwards of five levels above your own. It's a great way to power level yourself.
