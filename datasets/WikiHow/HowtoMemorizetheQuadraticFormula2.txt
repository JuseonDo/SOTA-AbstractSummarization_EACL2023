 This method can be especially effective if you pick a tune that is meaningful to you and create your own lyrics for it. You can make the song as silly or catchy as you want, but make sure to not make it too complicated, or it will be difficult to remember.

Write down the lyrics of the song so that you remember it. Even better, make a video of yourself singing it. Then you can listen to the video during your study sessions and sing along with it. You could also post it to  YouTube or another website so that it can help others who are also trying to remember the formula.
