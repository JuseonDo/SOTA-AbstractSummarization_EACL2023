,

@summary
when a zombie is chasing you, run around the hole.

@summary
repeat this trapping process until all of the zombies are gone.

@summary
either close them up or leave them to burn.
@article
, The zombie should continue walking straight towards you and fall into it.
 Soon you should have a pile of trapped zombies.
 To close them up, cover the hole with an easy-to-get substance such as dirt. Now you will not fall in there and they will not be able to escape. To leave them to burn just go away from the hole and make sure nothing is covering it. Wait for the sun to come out and the zombies should all die. After that cover it up again.
