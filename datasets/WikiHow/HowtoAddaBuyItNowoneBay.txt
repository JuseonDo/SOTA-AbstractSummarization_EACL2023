If you have a serial number, ISBN or UPC code for your product, enter it in the search box and click "search." EBay will attempt to locate your product for you and fill in much of the information for you.
If you do not have any of the numbers, simply describe the product yourself as accurately as possible.



You can add details to give your buyers a better idea of what your item is, how it performs and whether they should expect problems with it.



More pictures can increase the likelihood of a quick sale.
Buyers are reluctant to purchase an item online if there are no pictures of the actual item.



Select "Fixed Price" tab from the "Choose how you'd like to sell your item" section of the listing.



If you are using the "Fixed Price" option, this will be the only price you have to enter.
You can also select the "Online Auction" option tab and enter a starting sale price and a "Buy It Now" price.
