learn about the importance of the hormone cortisol.

@summary
cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex is under a negative feedback control in which its excess in the blood inhibits the secretion of the pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone.

@summary
know about the functions of cortisol.

@summary
people who administer cortisol as an anti-inflammatory agent can develop diabetes if the administration of the hormone is for along time such as occurs with people under a constant requirement to take this hormone as a supplement due to its deficiency in the body.

@summary
learn about the main disorders that involve cortisol.

@summary
the second cause of cushing syndrome is excessive secretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) by the pituitary gland itself or due to ectopic secretion of this hormone by a malignant tumour in the body.

@summary
the other cause is ectopic secretion of this hormone which can be caused for example due to a malignant tumour of the lungs.

@summary
in addition to these two causes which involve secretion of the acth in excessive amount to the blood circulation by the pituitary gland and which is called cushing disease, the adrenal cortex itself can undergo pathological condition in which a tumour of the adrenal cortex can oversecretes cortisol causing symptoms of cushing syndrome.

@summary
,

@summary
the adrenal cortex can have adenoma or carcinoma which are possible causes of oversecretion of the hormone cortisol.

@summary
the other disorder which involves cortisol is addison's disease or hypocortisolism.

@summary
addison's disease is manifested by increased secretion of acth which is oversecreted due to the lack of the negative feedback that cortisol usually makes on the secretion of acth.

@summary
this is caused due to the secretion of melanocytes stimulating factors by the pituitary gland the thing that increases the pigmentation of the skin.

 Cortisol is a very important steroid hormone which has many physiological functions in the body that are related to homeostasis of body tissues. This hormone is secreted by the adrenal gland in its cortical area in response to stimulation by the adrenocorticotropic hormone which is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in response to stimulation from the hormone corticotropin releasing hormone which is secreted by the hypothalamus.;
, Cortisol has many functions in the body so that its disorders are manifested clinically by many symptoms.
 Cortisol is an anti-inflammatory compound which usually functions by suppressing cells of the immune system. It is usually prescribed by doctors to treat inflammatory reactions such as allergies. Also cortisol has an important effect on glucose level in the blood. Its excess in the blood can cause a state of hyperglycemia with the development of diabetic symptoms in the affected individuals.
 Also cortisol can have an effect on blood pressure in the sense that its excess can increase the blood pressure due to the increased metabolic rate in the body that cortisol enhances.
 There are two main disorders which involve the hormone cortisol. These are: cushing syndrome and Addison's disease. Cushing syndrome is by definition a medical condition in which cortisol is excessive in the blood. This can have several causes. One of them is the result of administration of cortisol as a supplement for various reasons such as to treat inflammatory conditions of the skin for example. This is called iatrogenic cushing syndrome.
 The first cause that is related to increased secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland can be caused for example due to an adenoma of the gland which oversecretes this hormone.
 The net result in both of these two conditions is the excessive stimulation of the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete cortisol to the blood circulation with its concomitant symptoms of obesity and other symptoms.
, This occurs in up to 20% of all patients with cushing syndrome. Adenoma is more common in females more so than in males.
 This is primarily a disorder of the adrenal cortex in which it occurs due to an autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex by circulating antibodies. Also tuberculosis is another possible cause to this disorder. The autoimmune cause is however the main culprit to this disorder.
 Also one of the signs of addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, especially in areas where the skin creases.
 Also this condition can sometimes cause hypoglycemia and decreased blood pressure due to the usual effect that cortisol makes.
