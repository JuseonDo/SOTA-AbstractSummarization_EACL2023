 If they spot you, obey their instructions and tread water until they can reach you. If they don't hear, keep yelling but start dealing with the issue immediately.;
, Conserve energy and think clearly.
 If you have a board, hang onto it and use it to keep you afloat. If not, use your swimming abilities. Weaker swimmers will have more trouble than stronger swimmers, so don't try anything that you cannot manage.
 Instead, swim out of the current in a direction that follows the shoreline and cuts across the current diagonally. The aim is to swim over the rip current, as it usually peters out and does not extend across the entire shore. See the diagram next to the article summary for a pictorial explanation.
 It will carry you out of the current. You will be deeper but you won't be dragged under, so just keep treading water until rescue arrives and attract attention by waving your arms frequently. If you are a strong swimmer, you can attempt swimming back to shore at an angle.
