 This will keep you warm and dry you up at the same time.;
, If you have sensitive skin then just use an unscented lotion.This will make you smell good and feel good at the same time.
 Make sure your clothes are appropriate for what you are doing that day. For example of you are going to school wear some skinny jeans a tank top with a cardigan and a pair of boots.
 Again make sure it is appropriate for what you are doing that day. For school you might want to do a natural look for example: brown eyeliner, some champagne eyeshadow, mascara and a peach lip is perfect.
 This will moisturize your hair and it will make you hair super soft.
 If you aren't going to blow dry your hair then just go on ahead and comb it out.
, Don't overdo it or you will smell too strong.
