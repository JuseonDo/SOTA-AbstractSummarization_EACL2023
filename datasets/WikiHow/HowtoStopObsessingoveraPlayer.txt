 If it was destructive from the beginning it's better that it's over. If you are still involved with this person, break it off! The longer you are involved the harder this will be to heal.;
, Men can sense a women who doesn't respect herself (i.e. he knows that he is a loser so if you are with him, what do you think he thinks about you?).
 Take up a hobby. Exercise. Do what's best for you. Seek friends/family! Life is short!

, Co-dependence is not fun, whether it's a good guy or a player.
 HIV and AIDS don't discriminate and being with someone like this just increases risk! Nobody is worth all that!

, He is a jerk. You are not the only one he sleeps with and doesn't call the next day. Most players have women throwing themselves at them, regardless of the situation. Players numb the feeling of caring about anyone., Don't whine, cry etc. He isn't worth it. Remember any attention, negative or not is still attention which feeds his ego. End it quickly, with no messy interactions.
