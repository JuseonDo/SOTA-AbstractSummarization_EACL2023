 This will prevent the build up of bacteria on your hands and may prevent dirt under your nails getting worse.;
, Make sure it is clean, because otherwise you may be transferring dirt and skin cells back under your nails (yuck!).
, The more often you trim them (before they get too long), the stronger they will grow out to be.
, Don't worry if you can't though, because your body will usually provide natural moisture for your hands.
 It strengthens your nails and helps you push back those cuticles!
