,, Right after your search, you can check out the various Grand Theft Auto-related games or downloads available. If your console is a PS3, select the Grand Theft Auto V game download for the PS3. If you have a PS4, get the GTA V download for that specific console.
 After selecting the gaming platform of your choice, you will now have to enter the details of your PSN account. This will also serve as another way to confirm your age eligibility and region. If you do not have a PSN account, this will be a good time for you to create one.
 This time, you will be given the opportunity to take a second look at your chosen download purchase. Review all the important details of the download like price, quantity, and description, and make sure that everything is accurate.
 After checking the details, proceed to select your desired method of payment. You may choose to pay through your credit card, your PSN Card, or PayPal. After selecting the payment method, confirm your choice to download the game.
 When everything has been verified successfully, just sit back, relax, and wait for your download to finish. The game requires 17.2GB of your hard drive space for PS3 and 41.8GB for PS4, so be sure to keep your Internet connection at top speed to finish the download faster.
