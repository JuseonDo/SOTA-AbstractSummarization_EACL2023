 Take a shower once a day using soap all over the body. Shampoo should be applied to your hair at least once a week. This shower should be in addition to any showers you take after gym class or any sports you participate in.
 Even if you don’t believe you will be participating in any strenuous activity, apply deodorant each morning. They make sprays, gels, and solids in a variety of scents!

, For boys, that means shaving or trimming the face consistently to avoid an unkempt beard. (If you haven't had the need to shave yet, you can skip this step!) For girls, that means shaving or waxing the underarms and legs.
 Dentists recommend brushing your teeth before you go to bed and in the morning after breakfast (or when you wake up, if you don’t eat breakfast). You should always use a toothpaste that contains fluoride, and don’t forget to floss!
