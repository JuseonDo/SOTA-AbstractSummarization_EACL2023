 For example, saying "I can do it, I can do it!" It may be demanding, but after you get it out of the way, you will be relieved.;
, If there are events or happenings that you can't miss, find a time to complete your studies.
 Really make an effort to keep your finished homework in your planner.
 It helps a lot.
 School doesn't come easy. To have fun free time, it takes work and effort.
 In order to make this easier, eat a decent breakfast and get a some sleep the night before so your mind isn't set on food or sleep while you are in class.
 This is helpful, just in case there are any last minute tips your teacher may give you about a test, quiz, or just the topic you're learning about.
 When you are in class, you will then have something to keep you going throughout the day, in order to get to your free time to be able to do that activity. This tactic does take self control, however, it is up to you to get all of your homework done rather than skipping it to get to that one activity.
 If you have to study, then make sure you have flash cards to do it with.
 It is always better to do your homework right away, rather than doing your fun activity with the thought of your homework hanging over your head.
 That way, as your tolerance of the homework lessens, so does the required time spent, focus, and thought. This will make it infinitely easier for you to get your homework done efficiently, and thoroughly.
 You don't want to be behind because you forgot a binder, or homework. In most schools, you don't even receive credit for the homework you've done. SO DON'T FORGET ANYTHING!

, Thanks for reading!
