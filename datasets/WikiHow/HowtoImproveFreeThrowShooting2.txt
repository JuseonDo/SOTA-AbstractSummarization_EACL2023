 This is a very important part of the form and it dictates the flow for the rest of the shot. The proper turn would be to have your shooting hip and shoulder squared up or pointed at the direction of the ring. The feet should be turned 10-45 degrees towards your off hand.
 The off-hand should be supporting the ball and not pushing or holding it in any way. The strong handâ€™s elbow should be tucked in and the ball should be released at the highest point in the jump, with the wrists snapping forward upon release of the ball.
 This is called the follow through. The follow through can help with shot accuracy and shot strength. The follow through should be done on every shot, including hook shots, free throws and jump shots.
 The best shooters in the game developed the right shooting form by practicing it daily; taking hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of shots every day. Once you have the correct form, you have to constantly practice using it in your shot for muscle memory. Using the proper form should be second nature for good shooters.
