Use a scissor to cut away the lock of hair.Most labs will require the test taker to get their hair collected at a designated hair collection location.Different labs may require up to 100 mg of hair to conduct their drug tests. Call the lab and inquire before you start cutting off hair., Hair from other parts of the area, excluding pubic hair, can be gathered together to make up the minimum amount of hair that's needed for a test., Put the hair sample in a test tube and seal it. It's important that the container is air tight and doesn't contain any chemicals that would alter the results of the test., Send the hair off to a lab so that they can analyze it. Results will usually be available within a week.
