, Use this line to help you keep your cut straight. You don't need the other part of the phone book so put it aside or throw it out.
 Cut as close to the spine as possible for best results.
 To get the same amount of pages in each section look at the page number on the very last page and divide that number by 5 using a calculator. The number that comes up is the number of pages you need to have in each section.
 You may even want to glue the pencil to the spine to hold it in place as you roll. When you have finished rolling you should have the spine surrounding the pencil with 5 distinct page sections pin wheeling outward, each one held by a binder clip.
 To make this process easier you can use an empty toilet paper roll to guide your pages. Make sure that the pages are all flat against each other and put back the binder clip on that section. Because the ends of the pages don't line up now, use scissors to cut off any excess paper making them line up again. Do this step to all 5 sections.
 Hold it in place for several minutes until the glue dries. Repeat this step to the other 4 sections.
 Paint the top and outside of the desk organiser with at least 2 or 3 coats before painting the inside and bottom with 2-3 coats as well.
 This will be the bottom of the organiser ensuring that the things will not fall out. Secure it to the bottom of the desk organiser with the decoupage medium.
