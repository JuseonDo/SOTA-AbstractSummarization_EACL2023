 Alternatively, you can just do it on the computer by getting a grid and editing the original image.;
,, Do not do any shadows yet.
, If the image has no clear hair lines, make up your own. Try to copy the image's hair. Use a 4H pencil first, and use it lightly. After you've done this, draw new lines (for hair) with a 2B pencil, then use a 4B. Do not use the 4B pencil too excessively. You want the illusion of depth.
 Again, focus on using the 4H more. Use the 2B for the basic lines.
 Use the 4H and 2B for the shadows. Careful smudging works very well.
 2B for basic lines, 4H for the shadows. The 2B should also be used a bit. With a lot of drawings, the bottom lip is not heavily outlined. This is where shadowing needs to be focused on more.
 This process should be done like the nose and eyes-with a 2B and 4H. Carefully does it.
 This is where smudging comes most useful. Don't be afraid to use an eraser.
 Smudging is also handy here. The 4B can be used a bit more here too.
