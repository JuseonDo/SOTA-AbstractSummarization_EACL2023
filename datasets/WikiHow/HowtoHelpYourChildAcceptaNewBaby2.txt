@summary
keep the child's daily routines as normal as possible before, during, and after the birth.

@summary
figure out positive ways for your child to interact with the baby.

@summary
reward and reinforce behavior that's welcoming and positive, so that the child associates being a good sibling with having a happy parent and a happy family.

@summary
as much as you possibly can, ignore or overlook behavior that's unwelcoming and negative - the very last thing you want to do is to teach your older child that your precious attention and time can be obtained just as easily by pinching the baby or by saying "i hate the baby" as by offering to bring the baby a clean diaper.

@summary

@summary
try talking to the baby about the older child when the older child is nearby, e.g. "baby, look what your smart big brother did, he tied his own shoes/made his own bed/found the remote for me" and "baby, when you grow up, big sister can show you how to play candyland.",

@summary
don't *always* drop what you're doing as soon as the baby cries.

@summary
do fun things alone with your older child, especially if you do things with just the baby.

@summary
do fun things as a family.

 Try to keep a sense of normalcy so your child will not feel like the new baby is changing everything. Especially try to avoid major upheavals such as potty-training or a new childcare situation right before or after the birth.
 Your child can hold the baby (even toddlers can do this under close supervision, sitting down, with the baby on a pillow in the child's lap), sing to the new baby, try to "teach" the baby to smile, read to the new baby, and so on.
 For example, you can make a "Welcome Home" card with the child, spending quality time during the making and also making a big deal out of giving the card to both mother and baby.

, Many many many times your older children will have to wait while you take care of the baby. Every once in a while, make the baby wait.
 If you're taking a mother-and-baby exercise class, for example, make a point of doing something special with your older child about equally often. This will help your child see that there's still time for just the two of you. Even a trip to the grocery story without the baby can be fun for your older child if you're not too exhausted to be nice.
 Your child will naturally resent the baby if he or she feels the baby is preventing your family from doing fun things together. Show your child that the new baby is part of the family - this is important because young children sometimes do not understand that the baby is here to stay - by planning family outings where you can bring the baby along to share in the fun.
