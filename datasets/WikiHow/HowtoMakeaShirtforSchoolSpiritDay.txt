 Try to find one that matches the colors of your school. If you can't, a plain white or black shirt works just as well. Make sure it has no designs on it. It can be long sleeve, short sleeve, a tank top, etc.;
, Scroll down to "Things You'll Need" for a list. Gather everything and get organized. Put all your stuff in a big area on either a table or solid ground.
 Obviously you want your shirt to be loud and exciting. Make sure it has your school name on it and school mascot. You may want to consider putting your name, the year you made the shirt, the year you'll graduate, or other things to help you remember the shirt.
