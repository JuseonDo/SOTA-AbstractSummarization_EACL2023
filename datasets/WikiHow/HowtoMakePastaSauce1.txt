 of ground beef in a frying pan. Pour a 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) layer of vegetable oil in the pan and stir the beef until it's almost browned. When it's almost ready, add in 1 finely chopped small onion and dust the beef with a light layer of garlic powder.;
, To drain the beef, tip the pan over until the grease pours out. You can keep the beef in the pan by placing a plate below the beef, which will keep the beef from falling down as the grease drips out below the plate.
 You can also use a fork to mash the tomatoes, but the consistency will be a bit thicker.
,,, Stir the ingredients together.
