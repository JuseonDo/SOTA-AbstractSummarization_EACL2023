 Use painting pads instead of brushes or rollers. They will give you a smoother surface, and they are usually the same width as common baseboards, so you can paint the baseboard from top to bottom with one stroke.

, This type of paint will clean easily if you get scuff marks on the boards.
 You can use standard masking tape, but be careful because standard masking tape can pull the paint off of the walls. There are many specialty masking tapes that you can buy at any hardware store. Ask a store employee to help.
 The object is to avoid getting paint on the walls while you are paining the baseboards.
 Tape the plastic down with your masking tape, right where the baseboard meets the floor. You've now masked the baseboard.
 Push the paint pad into the paint, so that just the sponge part of the pad is covered in paint. Scrape the excess paint off of the pad by running it over the edge of the tray.
 You should be able to paint about 4 feet (1.2 m) of baseboard with each dip in the paint.
 Run the pad along the baseboard until the entire baseboard is painted. Make sure you overlap your strokes, and that each new section is blended together.
 That should give your baseboards time to dry.
