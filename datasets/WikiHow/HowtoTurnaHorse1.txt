Before learning how to turn a horse, you should know how to ride a horse to begin with. You should be able to mount and sit on a horse comfortably.
When riding Western, the horse you are riding will be a neck-reining horse. This means the horse will respond to the reins on his neck instead of the reins pulling at his mouth. Learn how to move the reins against the horses neck. To do this, you pull the reins gently to the right or left. (If to the right, the left rein will lay against the horse's neck and the right reins will not and vice versa.) The horse should turn his head if at a standstill. Some horses will even start walking if you turn them at a halt.;
,, Your horse should start walking.
 Your horse should turn his head and start turning. Keep the reins there until you're completely turned the way you want to be. Continue on.
