, After you wash the potatoes, use a paper towel to cover them in non-fat cooking spray and place them on a baking tray. It should take 45-60 minutes to bake the potatoes. You can test them by poking them with a fork.
 Wait at least 10 minutes for them to cool down.
 Use a knife to cut one long slice through each potato to separate it in two.
 Use a spoon to scoop out most of the potato flesh, so that only 10-20% of the flesh is remaining in each potato. Repeat this process for each potato half.
 unsalted butter in the microwave. Place it in a microwave-safe covered bowl and melt it for 30-60 seconds until it has a liquid consistency. Make sure to cover the bowl or the cheese will splatter.
, Use a brush or paper towel to coat the insides and outsides of the skins with the butter. This will make them crispier and will prevent them from burning.
 Add just a punch of salt and pepper to each skin. You can add more, depending on your preference.
 Wait until the insides are nice and crispy.
, Distribute them evenly along the skins.
 Cook them until the cheese is melted.
,,,, Cook them for another 3-5 minutes, until the warmed cheese is melted.
 Sprinkle them with more salt to taste.
 Enjoy this perfect snack of nacho-riffic potato skins. You can enjoy them as they are or add a side of sour cream to the mixture. They're perfect with a glass of beer.
