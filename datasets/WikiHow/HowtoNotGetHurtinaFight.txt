 If someone is trying to provoke you, don't challenge them.;
, Don't let them take you by surprise. If you're in a situation where you think someone might attack you, stay vigilant.
 This will give you a second to collect yourself and get ready.
 Wait until they throw a wild punch, then jab at their stomach.
 If they swing and you block it, add some snap to it so that you hurt their arm. Enough pain will make them back off.
 You don't have to be doing matrix moves, just make sure that if you miss with a block that you won't be wide open.
 Don't let them grab onto you.
 This could enrage them enough to try to keep fighting you, and will also be used against you if they try to get you in trouble.
