,,,,,, This is a realistic volleyball so try to out bulks to show the actual volume of the ballâ€™s surface.
 Simply trace the outline sketches that were sketched earlier.
 Get your white crayon and start coloring the white areas. When you color using crayons, you have to leave the parts that needed a different color because it is a little bit hard to blend colors with crayons. Crayons are not as soft as pastels.
 On the not colored areas, stroke your gray crayon on a shape that adapts to the shape of the ball and the shadow.
 It is hard to blend two crayon colors but it is still possible. All you have to do is to add a layer of the color that you want to blend. In this case, get the white crayon and add another layer of it with some parts of the gray.
