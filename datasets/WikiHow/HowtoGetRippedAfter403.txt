 Yes, you can gain weight on only three meals a day, but only if you consume enough calories within those meals.
 Buy Whey Protein, Creatine, or make your own.
, Resting allows your muscles to develop. Try drinking some sleep herbal teas that shall allow you to rest at night.
 Junk food can put on weight or bulk you up rather fast, but after 40, it is very unhealthy to the body. So, if you are not suffering from weight loss issues, then you can eat junk food more often.
 Sprint instead of jogging. Cardio prevents your ability to put on weight. Therefore, do not do it as much.
