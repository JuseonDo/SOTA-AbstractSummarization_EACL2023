,, Anything goes with jeans, so get creative!

, Corduroys are the warmest pants you can wear in the winter, and are a much better option than jeans. Jeans get cold easily and are sometimes uncomfortable in cold weather, whereas dress pants are too thin. Wearing thick leggings underneath a pair of corduroys is an excellent way to feel warm.
