 Go to the W-shop and pick up paint (which is cheap and pretty) and a floor (a wood floor works well with any color or wallpaper).;
, You can have a playroom, a theater (don't overspend on the theater theme), an art or designing studio, a bedroom, and lots more.
 Look at the previews too so you get a good idea what the item will look like in a room.
,, If you have a designing studio, you will want a trunk for your clothes, a stage, a desk, markers,and lights. You can toss a board game or flowers on a coffee table. Fill your playroom with lots of interactive toys. Be creative!
