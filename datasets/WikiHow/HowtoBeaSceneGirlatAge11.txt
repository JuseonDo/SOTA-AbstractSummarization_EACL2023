, Add a cute background and some cool scene music to your page. Take tons of pics and edit them in a good software. ONLY UPLOAD THE FLATTERING ONES. Also, an optional thing is to have a cute scene name. Make sure you ask your parents. Remember, you're still 11 and need permission first.
 "Zumiez","Rue21","Bluenote",& "5below" have really cute shirts.You MUST have skinny jeans! Don't spend $100 on skinny jeans,Ross,Target,Walmart TJ Maxx have really good ones. You could also wear tutus with leggings or over jeans.
: Cute necklaces, a couple of jelly bracelets, pyramid stud belts, huge sunglasses, and tiaras are all good ideas for accessories. Also, you can punch the lenses out of 3D glasses for dorky glasses, as those are popular now. You can wear "kandi" (beaded bracelets) .
 Go to the salon and ask for short, choppy layers and a fringe (bangs).
, Not all the make-up, pictures, clothes, and hair. I don't mean mainstream music like Drake, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, and artist like that. I mean the music that speaks to your soul, music that makes yo wanna get up and dance every time you hear it. You can listen to any music you like, just as long as it isn't mainstream.
 Scene kids are thought of as rude, impolite, selfish,immature, because of the stereotype. Scene kids today who are trying to be a scene kid are acting like the stereotype and not even knowing it and are giving Scene a bad name. If your going to be scene youMUST BE NICE Your are representing the scene community and your fellow scenery. Don't run around screaming about how scene you are,Because only posers call themselves scene. And scene girls know their scene, so they don't need to talk about it.
 Instead say " No I'm not (insert what they called you here) I can't really label myself, but I would fall under the category of Scene" if you say that you will sound more mature and not like a poser.
