 If you have dark skin, then dreadlocks are good. Black, light brown, dirty blond and red are all great, but your natural shade will work too. If dreadlocks do not work for you, braid your hair into numerous tiny braids to achieve a similar effect. This can be done at a hair salon, with an electric hair-braider. If you have a very patient friend with nimble fingers, this will also work. Alternatively, you can just wear your hair messy, and kind of sloppy.
, It should be swept under your cheekbones to make them stick out.
 Mascara is okay, as long as it's black or brown. The same goes for eyeliner.
 Keep the shine to a minimum if any. Avoid lip liner. You don't have to wear lipstick or gloss at all.
 Pirates never had nail polish, but if you feel naked without it, wear a clear, black or flesh toned coat. Keep your nails about the length of a well-groomed guy's nails. Let the dirt build up underneath!

, Walk around barefoot to improve this. Avoid wearing any footwear.
 Pirates are not cute, and your goal in this is not to be a "sweet but kind of sexy pirate-ish gal". That will just be embarrassing.
