 Squeeze your feet into the new leather shoes.
 Heat each shoe in turn with a hairdryer, bending your feet back and forth as much as is possible. Blow with heat for 20-30 seconds at a time.
 Keep the shoes on as they cool.
 Put on thinner socks or pantyhose. Try on the shoes. If you can feel enough of a difference, the shoes are stretched. If not, repeat the process.
 This conditioning will restore any depleted moisture caused by the heat.
