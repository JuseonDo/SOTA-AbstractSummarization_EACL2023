where you see localhost or 127.0.0.1, look on the right for the port number.

,,, Copy the port number.
 The IP will be 127.0.0.1 (or localhost) and the port number will be the one you copied from the tor browser earlier (see where I'm going with this?). Save the settings/activate the new proxy.


This will route all your network traffic through tor using the same port as the tor browser, making EVERYTHING you do anonymous, and giving you the ability to view onion links in any browser application (chrome!!!!!)
Since tor usually switches ports On each re-connect to the tor network, you will need to redo steps 2-5 each time you reconnect to tor. This isn't a problem if you stay connected to tor all the time like me.
