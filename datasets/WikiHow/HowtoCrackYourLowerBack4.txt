 A chair without armrests is best so that you have a freer range of motion with your arms.
 If you're working with your right elbow, bend it and rest it on the outside of the left knee.
 If you're resting your right elbow against your left knee, turn your torso to the left. If you're resting your left elbow against your right knee, turn your torso to the right.









Be careful as you turn your torso. No jerky motions or sudden movements. A relaxed and steady pressure is best when trying to crack your back.
, Bend your right knee and bring your right leg over your outstretched left leg, which should be flat on the ground. Take your left elbow and position it on the outside of the bent right leg. Move your torso to the right, using your left elbow against your right knee as a fulcrum.









This is the same basic stretch as the seated chair crack â€” both use elbows against opposite knees as anchors. Once you feel the crack in your lower back, repeat the process using the opposite leg and elbow.
