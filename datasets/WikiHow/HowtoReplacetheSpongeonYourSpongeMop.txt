@summary
assemble these materials: a measuring tape, a cellulose sponge refill, a sharp knife, scissors, polyester sponge (from a home improvement store), and rubber cement.

@summary
measure the sponge refill and write down the dimensions of it.

@summary
go to the home improvement store, buy a big polyester sponge and cut it in half.

@summary
make a test of the whether the sponge can withstand the rubber cement.

@summary
remove the sponge from a used mop head refill.

@summary
,

@summary
shape the polyester sponge to the shape of a new cellulose, sponge refill.

@summary
apply rubber cement generously and especially at the edges and mount the sponge.

@summary
,

@summary
bind the sponge, to the base, by closing the hinged squeezer and tying it, in the clamped position, to the mop handle, with some cordage.

@summary
,

@summary
let the glue set for a day, remove the cordage that was holding the water squeezer down on the sponge.

@summary
you now have a sponge, on, that nary needs frequent changing.

, The dimensions, for the sponge, on a Rubbermaid Sponge Mop is: length - 9 5/8", width - 2 7/8", height a - 1 1/4" and height b 1 3/16". There is a taper to the shape and the different heights reflect that. The sponge can also be made a bit thicker (1/16" - 3/16") for more durability.
 This is a durable type of sponge that is used for heavy cleaning, so it would probably not be found in drug or grocery stores. Make sure the sponge is of the right size (more than 9" long and 6" wide so the polyester sponge can be use twice). The sponge mop refill length is 9 5/8" and sponge bought was 9" long, but the 9" sponge is usable because it fits perfectly on the mounting plate which is 8 3/8" wide.
 If the sponge "melts" from the rubber cement, try using a milder rubber cement. These heavy duty sponges are durable and should not melt from the rubber cement. As a general rule, the free running cement will tend to melt sponge more than the thick type.
, Sharpen your knife first and use a thin bladed knife. Use a good scissors to do some snipping. Carefully make one side of the sponge flat(this is the side that will have the rubber cement sticking to it). The plastic plate, that you will glue the sponge on, may be warped because the cellulose sponges contract when dried, so you may have to shape the sponge to fit the plastic plate.
