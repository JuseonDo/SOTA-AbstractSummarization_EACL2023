 Make sure you are happy about it being dyed. It's best if the t-shirt is already old and quite worn.;
,, Add it mainly near the neck and arms.
 The color will change to the red color of blood. Let it dry in the sun.
, Mix some cornflour, water and a little red food dye together.
 Make it look like sores, torn skin and blood.
, Add some normal shorts, pants or jeans.
 If possible, add blood stains to the shoes as well, in circles to suggest drips. This isn't necessary if you don't want to ruin the shoes but makes a nice touch if using shoes about to be tossed out.
