, Some will wave, and others will try to say something that you obviously canâ€™t hear over the sound of the cart, so just smile. Its best to always try to stop and talk to everyone and make small talk. This will make the customer feel good and for them know that even if they don't want a drink they you are there and that you still care about them and not the just the sale. Next time they just may get a drink because of this.


# Leave your phone on and keep where you can hear it in case the clubhouse needs to call and direct you to THIRSTY GOLFERS., You must charge for EVERYTHING! Giving away free drinks/undercharging will lead to immediate termination.
 This is a frequent occurrence and you can sit behind a tree for up to 5 minutes as the golfers take turns. .
 Be completely silent as not to break their concentration. Stay out of the fescue grass. DO NOT DRIVE ON THE TEES OR GREENS! Do not cross a fairway in front of golfers you may get hit and its not proper golf etiquette. Then congratulate them on their shot by offering them a cold beer.
 They appreciate being recognized and will reward you.
