,, Divide the top rectangle in the middle. Draw a perpendicular line in the lower half about 1/3 of the way down the rectangle. Draw curved lines at the points as shown in the illustration.
 It is up to you how much detail you want your gun to have. Some of the essential details are the trigger, which can be made by drawing a triangle in the oval you made, and the sight/s by drawing 2 triangles at the top rectangle. Also, draw a small rectangle at the end of the L shape for the hole of the barrel.
