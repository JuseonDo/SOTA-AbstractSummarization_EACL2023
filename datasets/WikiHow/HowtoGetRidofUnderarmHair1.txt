 Washing with warm water and soap is best. Any oils, deodorants, and other residues that could clog your razor will be removed.





;
, Shave gel helps razors move across your skin more smoothly, preventing cuts and nicks.
 This movement pulls your skin taut. You’ll now be able to remove hair from hard to reach areas with your razor more easily.
 Underarm hair grows in a swirl pattern. Using an X motion helps to prevent skin irritations and ensures a closer shave.
 The cool water will close your pores.
 Once you’ve finished shaving the first underarm, follow the process again on the second underarm.









Use warm water to rinse your razor. You should rinse your razor in-between each shave to keep it clean., You apply more pressure against your skin when you use a dull razor, which can lead to razor burn.








Visit your doctor if your razor burn and bumps won’t go away. They could be signs of a more serious skin condition.
