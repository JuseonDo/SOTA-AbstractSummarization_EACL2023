first, consider the website you're surfing.

@summary
look at the title of the animation.

@summary
look for anything that requires you to turn the volume up and/or concentrate hard on an image.

@summary
turn off the sound.

@summary
if you suspect it could be a trick, let it play but step away from your computer and turn the sound down.

@summary
if it's on youtube, look at the comments and see if anyone complains about the scare in the video.

@summary
also look at the tags of the video.

@summary
sometimes, if it's a video where they have a clock counting to new hour, it's going to be a screamer.

@summary
,

@summary
ask a friend if they have seen it before.

@summary
,

@summary
try to calm yourself before watching the video.

@summary
as the video begins, play a song through your computer speakers.

 If it's one that you've never seen before, don't take the risk.;
, If it looks like something boring or interesting, chances are it's a trick to scare you.(Note: some screamers have titles that say how to prevent screamers)

, It is usually a sign of a scary experience.
 If it does happen to be a "shock flash" animation, it will scream at you.
 Don't concentrate on it too much, it won't shock you this way.
 Also, look at the related videos. If it has a video of the car, any scary faces or pop-up video that you have seen, then it is a pop-up video.
 Some words just might give it away that it is a pop-up.
,, The more you anticipate it the more scared you will be., Make sure the song is loud and is not itself scary, or else it will backfire, and you will end up even more scared. Place some breathable, translucent material over your face, like a sheer scarf. The material should really be translucent; too clear, and you might see the video; too opaque, and you won't be able to see if, while the video is playing, someone walks up to you with the obvious intention of giving you a good scare.
