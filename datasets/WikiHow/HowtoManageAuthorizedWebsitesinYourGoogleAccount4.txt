Under “Sign-in and Security”, go to “Signing in to Google”.
 You will find this on the right side of the page.
,,,, A prompt will appear on the screen, asking you to enter your pin or password.
 Click “Yes” on the prompt that says, “Trying to sign-in?”. This will confirm your password and turn on Google Prompt.


You will need to have a password or pin-enabled Android phone for Google Prompt to work.
Once Google Prompt is enabled, it will become the default verification step. Even if you enabled verification via text or voice message, now verification will take place via Prompt.
