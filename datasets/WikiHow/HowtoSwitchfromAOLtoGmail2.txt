 Mail Fetcher is a free feature that lets you download email messages from 5 different email accounts (that support POP access). You can use Mail Fetcher to move your AOL messages into Gmail.;
, Select Settings.


Open the Accounts and Import tab. (For Google Apps domains, open the Accounts tab.)
In the Check mail using POP3 section, click Add POP3 Email Account.
 Then click Next Step.


Gmail will populate sample settings, but also check with your AOL server to learn the correct server name and port.

Once your account has been added successfully, you'll have the option of setting it as a custom From address. This allows you to compose messages in Gmail, but have them appear to be sent from your other email account. Click Yes.
