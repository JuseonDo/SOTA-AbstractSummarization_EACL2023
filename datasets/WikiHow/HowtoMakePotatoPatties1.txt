 You can use leftover mashed potatoes from last night's dinner, or you can make some from scratch. If you are making them from scratch, do the following:


Peel and cut 4 medium-sized potatoes.
Fill a large pot with salted water, enough to cover the potatoes.
Boil the potatoes until they are soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.Drain the water.
Mash the potatoes with a fork or potato masher.;
, Roll the potato mixture into eight balls, then gently flatten them with your palm. This will be enough to serve four people, with two patties each.
 The dish needs to be shallow enough to fit at least one potato patty.
 Make sure that you dip both sides of the potato patties into the flour mixture. This will help give them that nice, golden color once they are fried.
 Gently tilt the skillet from side to side to coat the bottom evenly. To prevent the potato patties from getting too oily, heat only 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil. You can add more oil as you continue to cook the patties.
 Chances are, your skillet is large enough to fit one or two potato patties, which is fine. It is better to cook them a few at a time rather than cramming all of them into a single skillet.
 Flip the patties using a spatula, and cook them for another 15 minutes.
 If you'd like, you can season them with extra salt and pepper to your liking.
