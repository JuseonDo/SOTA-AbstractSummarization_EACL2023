 If there is still a label on the medicine container, wash/peel it off.
 Alternatively, you can use beads, dehydrated beans, or uncooked popping corn, which will rattle instead of jingle. This type of toy is designed to replicate the scampering movement of small prey. The rattling or jingling contents will draw your cat's attention to the toy whenever you throw it, and your cat's predator instincts should make it want to chase the toy., If you think the cat may be able to open the bottle, despite the safety cap, tape it shut with duct tape.
