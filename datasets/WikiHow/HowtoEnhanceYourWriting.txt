@summary
get a journal, something that you enjoy writing with (colorful glitter pens, mechanical pencil-whatever) make a special time to write everyday and make sure it is well lighted, quiet, and you can concentrate and be inspired.

@summary
when you are writing in general, ensure that you always try to keep the words flowing.

@summary
read widely!,

@summary
whenever you find out a very interesting, new word or an important english rule or even a new random fact, write it somewhere.

@summary
write what makes you want to write more.

@summary
observe your surroundings.

@summary
inspiration is good, but the best writers, the masters of the craft, learn to control their 'muse' to some degree- try to do the same.

, A great way to practice this is to pick a random topic and write about that for 5-10 minutes, and never stop writing! Even if your words run dry, keep it flowing! It doesn't matter what you write; just write something!

, Read whatever you enjoy reading and figure out what you like about that author's writing and try to write like that. Also you will learn all sorts of new words.
 Anywhere. Try on your arm or sticking bits of paper in your pockets.
 If you hate writing about owls, don't write about owls. Eventually, you'll become comfortable writing about anything, but even then you'll always have favorites.
 If you are in a forest, pretend like you're a character and imagine what you'd write if you were describing this place and what kind of mood you would set and what kind of action would take place.
 Occasionally, to challenge yourself, write about something you aren't fond of. Eventually you may even like writing about owls.
