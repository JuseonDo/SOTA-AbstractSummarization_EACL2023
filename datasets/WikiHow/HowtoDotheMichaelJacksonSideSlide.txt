 Place your feet shoulder width apart and pointing diagonally outwards.;
,, You should feel the muscles in your left thigh working as they take your weight.
, Snap your left knee back and your right knee forward so that this is reversed. Snap! Snap!

,, As you push off, turn your left foot in the direction that it's sliding and take the weight onto your left toes to stop the slide.
 Your heel should slide along 'into' the floor in a straight line.
, Push down and into the floor with your right foot while sliding your left foot away. Remember to point your left toe in the direction you are travelling and keep your back upright and straight at all times.
 At the end of the movement flip your toes down and your heel up once more.
 You now have all the necessary footwork to pull this off, but next you have to join it up into one continuous line by repeating these moves to build up speed and smoothness.
 Keep your arms straight and bring them to the front of your body with your fingers pointing outward and your palms parallel to the floor. Next move your arms up and down from the shoulder. Add in a rotation so that your arms look like pistons driving the motion in the rest of your body.
 Be careful not to jerk your neck. This movement should be smooth and steady.
 Don't worry if you don't get the Michael Jackson side slide straight away. It won't be long until you've nailed the dance and can use your sweet new moves to impress friends and family.
