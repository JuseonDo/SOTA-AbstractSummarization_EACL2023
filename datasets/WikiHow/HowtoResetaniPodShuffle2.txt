 The iPod Shuffle cannot be reset when connected to a computer via USB.
 When powered off, the green stripe underneath the Power switch will not be visible.
 This allows enough time for the iPod to power off completely.
 The green stripe will now be visible, and your iPod Shuffle is now reset.


If using the iPod Shuffle 4G, slide the power switch to the “On” position instead of toggling the playlist button.
