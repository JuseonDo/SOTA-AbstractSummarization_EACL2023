 Alternatively, horehound can be grown by cuttings, which will take easily (just dust a little hormone powder on the end).;
, Horehound will grow in poor soils but if the soil is rich, it will grow more vigorously and last longer.
 Cover barely.
, Regular watering after this is not necessary; the plants will fend well for themselves.
 Remove any scraggly ones (you'll get plenty of vigorous growers).
 After a year's growth, cut the horehound back by half. Remove the flowers to avoid self-seeding, as this plant can get away from you!
