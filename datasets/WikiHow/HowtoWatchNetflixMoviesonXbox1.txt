If Netflix does not appear in the Video Marketplace, go under Apps to Browse Apps, and find it there.
, (You will be prompted to sign-up for a Gold Membership if you don’t already have one)

,


Use the onscreen instructions to create a Netflix account if you do not already have one.
, If you live in a different country that has Netflix, it will redirect to Netflix in your country.
,,,,, When the video is playing, you may find that you need to pause it for some reason. If that is the case simply tap the A button and the video will pause.


Tap it again and the video will resume.
 If you missed an important part of the movie, or want to skip ahead to the best part, you can do so by fast-forwarding and rewinding the movie.


In order to fast-forward, simply tap the right trigger on the top of the controller. If you tap it again, it will fast-forward faster. In order to get it to stop fast-forwarding, just press the A button on your controller.
You can do the same exact thing with rewinding, the only difference is the left trigger on the controller makes it rewind.
