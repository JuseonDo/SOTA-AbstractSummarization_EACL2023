 GPS allows you to automatically map all points that are found to GPS coordinates. These coordinates can then be viewed later with a mapping program, or shared with the wardriving community.

Get a GPS device and your Netstumbler and Wigle software running (see Tips)

, After doing so, you will be able to download map packs of your area. These will be necessary to view the plotted access points that you found on a geographic map.

After wardriving for a period of time while running the Netstumbler and Wigle software, you will have made a log file containing all of the coordinates of the access points.
Upload this log file to Wigle, which will then automatically plot the points onto a map for you.
Re-download the map pack to view these points on a map in Wigle.
