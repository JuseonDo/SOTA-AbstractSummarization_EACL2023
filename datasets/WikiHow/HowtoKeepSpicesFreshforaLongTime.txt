 Powdered spices have already begun to lose their essence before you even take them home. On the other hand, whole spices have not. Whole spices last much longer, sometimes even years longer, than powdered spices.
 There are many grinders easily available today., Only purchase such spices in very small quantities., Plastic can leach into the spices or remove the scent and flavour from the spices. In turn, this reduces their potency. Spices do not usually spoil, but they do become less effective., Store the bottles in a cool, dry place.

Drawers or cabinets are ideal. A spice rack is a good way to organize them.
 Constantly removing the bottles of spice in and out the fridge causes condensation to form inside the bottle. The moisture will ruin the spices faster, so avoid using the fridge and just use your cabinets., Do not hold the bottle directly over steam, as this will introduce moisture to the container, which can ruin the spices by causing them to clump. Instead, take out the spice using a spoon and transferring that to the dish.
