@article
 It seems so awesome and useful at first, but in the long run, it's all a drain on your spirit and soul. Stop using Facebook; stop caring about your friends' latest status updates. Stop spending every waking moment on your cell-phone texting. Drop the online games.;
, Focus on what makes you happy and what makes others happy.
 Some of the most beautiful, pioneering, mind-altering music is the music of the late 60s/early 70s. Listen to bands such as Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jimi Hendrix, etc. Of course there are lots of great rock bands from today too, like the Black Keys, My Morning Jacket and the White Stripes.
 People these days tend to wear very dark clothes, dark shoes, dark coat, etc. Today's modern man/woman is very depressed, conservative, judgmental and unwilling to try new things; as such, their dress sense reflects this. Brighten up with clothes!

, Love those who make you happy, and as for those who make you upset, love them only less. Don't judge people by appearance, and be friendly to all.
, If you want to live in the 60s, why are you even on the computer, reading this article, in the first place?

, People commonly smoked indoors in the 60s; doing this will increase the 1960s feeling. Remember that smoking is extremely detrimental to your health. Don't start simply because of this article. We have the advantage of knowing how harmful cigarettes are today, which people did not have in the 60s.
 Responsibly using these drugs may increase connotation of the 60s, but keep in mind that drugs are illegal and can be very detrimental to your health if not used responsibly. Make the decision for yourself.
