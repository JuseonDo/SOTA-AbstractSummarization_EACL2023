 The roots hold the sod bricks together during construction.;
, Mark the area where you will build the house so you will know where to place the exterior walls. Leave a space for the door.
 This creates the floor of the house.
, Cut down to a depth of 4 inches.
 This creates uniform bricks of sod which you can then remove and stack near where you will build the house.
 Follow the markers for the exterior walls.
 Place the center of the second-row bricks directly over where two first-row bricks meet. You must cut some bricks in half to fit the corners.
 Stagger the bricks so the ends of the bricks on the row below are directly under the centers of the bricks on top. Every few rows, lay the bricks crosswise to the row underneath to help make the walls more sturdy.
 Place the frames for the windows on the walls and the door frame in the space you left for the door.
 Leave room between the bricks and the frames and stuff the spaces with grass. If you pack too closely, the sod may settle and cause the frames to shift or the window glass to break.
 Several styles of roof were used on sod houses, ranging from flat roofs made from a lattice of tree branches, to traditional gabled roofs made from lumber, tar paper and shingles. A quality roof can protect a sod house for many years with little need for maintenance.
 Place the grass-side up to protect against erosion.
,,, You may also choose to cover the outside of the walls with stucco to protect them from the weather.
