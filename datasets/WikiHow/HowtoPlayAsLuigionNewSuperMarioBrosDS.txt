Many people say you must beat this game in order to unlock Luigi, but that is untrue because you can do this anytime at all, even when you start the first level of the game.

If you just go ahead and pick a game without following these instructions, you will not be able to play as Luigi, so do not choose a game yet.

If you let go of the L and R buttons before you press A, you will not be able to play as Luigi, so press A whilst holding L and R.



If you hear Luigi saying his name in the background, you have done the task correctly. If not, try again until you hear him.
