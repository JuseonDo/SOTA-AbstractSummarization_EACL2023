, Avast! 4 Home is free for personal home use, and CounterSpy is $19.99. Once you have the product keys, install each program.
 This will enable you to enter in the key emailed to you. Avast is now good for 14 months.
 During this time, it will request the product key, as well as to set up some initial preferences. Once the wizard has finished, run CounterSpy to perform a scan. You want to go ahead and remove all that it finds.
