, There must be adequate ventilation. Take proper precautions, such as wearing gloves and protective eyewear. And use the same precautions listed on the labels of the ingredients, in addition to your common sense.
 Add one and a half teaspoons of lye.
, Heat the oil to about 60ºC or 140ºF.
 Add the methanol/lye mixture.
, Through a process called transesterification, you will see a dark layer of glycerin forming beneath the lighter layer of biodiesel fuel, as the trans-fatty acids in the oil are stripped of one molecule of glycerin, which is replaced with three molecules of alcohol.
 Over the next couple of days, you will see your biodiesel become clearer. This occurs as all the glycerin settles.
 This biodiesel fuel will work in almost any modern diesel engine. Ask your mechanic if you have any rubber hoses or gaskets, and have the mechanic replace them with synthetic. Biodiesel will dissolve natural rubber and that will end up clogging your filters. It has substantially reduced carbon emissions.
