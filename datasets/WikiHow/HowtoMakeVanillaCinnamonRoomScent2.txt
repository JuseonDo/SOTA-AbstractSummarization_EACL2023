 If you don't have a funnel, you can make a simple one by rolling up a sheet of paper into a cone. Baking soda has some wonderful deodorizing properties.


Use a plastic bottle if you can. Essential oils may degrade certain types of plastic.
 You can use equal parts of both vanilla and cinnamon essential oil, or you can use a little bit more/less of one of them. For example, if you really like the scent of vanilla, you could do 7 drops of vanilla essential oil and 5 drops of cinnamon essential oil. You will need 12 drops of oil total., This will help distribute the essential oils throughout the baking soda. Keep shaking until you don't see any clumps in the baking soda.
 Try to use distilled water or filtered water if you can. Tap water has too many mineral and chemicals, which can affect the spray.
 The baking soda and oils may separate over time, so you will need to shake the bottle each time before you use it.
