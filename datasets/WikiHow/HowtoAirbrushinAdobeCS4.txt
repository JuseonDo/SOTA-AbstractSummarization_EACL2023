 Duplicate your image layer by going to your layers window and dragging it to the "create a new layer" icon. Then, create a new group folder by clicking on the "create a new group" icon. Drag the duplicate layer to the folder; the folder will serve as the holder of all your edited layers.;
,, Set the settings according to what you see on the accompanied image. You can also experiment with the sliders and apply a surface blur that you think provides a balance between a realistic effect and an edited image.
,, Then, set the settings to 50% gray and the opacity to 100%.
 Go to filter>noise>add noise.
 Set the settings to Monochromatic and the distribution of the noise to Gaussian.
 To apply the blur, go to filter>blur>Gaussian blur.
, Apply the layer mask by selecting layer>layer mask>hide all. You can also click the “add a layer mask” icon to add layer mask (hold down the alt key/option key (for Mac) for the hide all application).
 First select the layer mask and then using the brush tool, paint over the skin of your image. Remember also to keep the foreground color white on your tools panel.

For a softer brush, hold down the shift key and “”. For the example image, a 15% to 45% brush softness was used.
 Do so by correcting the color of the skin by adjusting the hue/saturation. Select your layer filled with 50% gray and go to image>adjustments>hue/saturation. Alternatively, you can type in Ctrl+U (or Command+U for Mac users).
 Experiment with settings until you are satisfied with the color of the skin of your image. On the accompanied image, less saturation was applied to make the skin slightly lighter.
, Then, experiment with the opacity. On the example image, the red channel is used with a 24% opacity.
 Here is the final product.
