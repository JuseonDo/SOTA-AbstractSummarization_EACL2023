Normally, a hedge border runs along the edge of a property or a garden. Plot a line that runs over level ground with even access to sun and consistent soil along its entirety: remember that your hedge plants will need to grow evenly.;

Consult your local nursery for advice on which plants grow best in your climate. For a short hedge of up to 5 feet (or 1.5 meters), consider azaleas, dwarf oleander, or Indian hawthorn. For a tall hedge of 10 feet (3 meters) or greater, look at Japanese yew, pittosporum, and wax myrtle.

Bulbs should be placed about 4 feet (or 1.2 meters) apart for most plants. Bury the bulbs about 3 inches (or 7.6 cm) into the layer of fertilizing soil or compost.

Pruning involves clipping leaves and branches from the top and sides of the hedge with garden shears. Remove any especially long branches or dense masses of leaves. Your goal is to create a consistent, full look along the length of the hedge.
