, From about an inch (2.54 cm) from the top, cut a slit all the way through to the bottom. This would make 2 legs.
 This would make 4 legs so far., You are going to cut the "ridge" of the 4th leg, matching the length of the cuts. One of these slits are going to make 2 legs. Repeat for the 3 other legs to make 8 legs total.
 Be aware that the legs will curl up in the process, so be sure that there's enough room in the pot.
