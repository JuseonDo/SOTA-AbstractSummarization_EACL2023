@summary
look around the audience and don't focus on only one focal point.

@summary
speak slowly and try to breathe normally.

@summary
laugh at yourself if something goes wrong.

@summary
give your audience a chance to interact with you, (ask them questions, and have them ask you questions so you can touch up on some points that you overlooked and/or left out,)before leaving the podium at the end of your speech.

Make eye contact with members of your audience. If eye contact is too intense for you, look just above their heads at a point such as a clock or a painting.
Move your eyes around your audience so that everyone feels included in the presentation.
 The natural adrenaline rush that you will have in front of your audience may make you want to speak much too quickly. And have a confident smile on your face.
 If by chance, you forget your speech, then simply say thank you and leave the stage. Your audience will find you much more easy to relate to, and you won't lose their confidence in your knowledge of your subject.
 Acknowledge your audience with a smile, a brief nod or a slight bow, if appropriate.
