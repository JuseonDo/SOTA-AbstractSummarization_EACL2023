To find out how to change a particular program’s startup settings, look at the program’s “help” offerings, or do an internet search.
For example, Skype, an internet telephony/chat program, can be disabled via Tools → Options → General Settings → deselect "Start Skype when I start Windows".
As another example, Dropbox, a file sharing and storage program, can be disabled by right-clicking the system tray icon (the icon in the windows toolbar near the clock), clicking the gear-shaped icon, then selecting “Preferences…”

, Startup items can be deleted manually though your computer’s “regedit” program.


See an overview of this process here.
Editing your computer’s registry should only be done as a last resort and only if you know exactly what you are doing.
