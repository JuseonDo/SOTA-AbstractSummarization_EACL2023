, Mix the yeast kinds together.
 Take a cup of distilled water and 2 teaspoons of sugar or splenda, sugar works best, and mix them together. Now pour the sugar water into the jar holding the yeast. The yeast should turn into a brown or yellow blob.
 You should see the blob start to grow. Take the newly grown slime and put it in a separate jar. Does it change, grow, look, or act different than your first blob of yeast? If so you have created a hybrid colony of yeast. Sometimes you need a microscope to see the differences.
 Baker's yeast is a species of yeast that reproduces sexually like animals and some plants. It is used to make bread rise. Brewer's yeast is a modified, more complex strain of baker's yeast. It is used to brew beer and wine. They reproduce by merging together than breaking apart into many yeast cells. The 2 different strains merged and split into many hybrid cells.
