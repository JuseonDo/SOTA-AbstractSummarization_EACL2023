@article
, This means your index finger and middle finger are on top of the ball with your thumb pushing it against your folded ring finger and pinky for support.
 This is where the seams form a C shape, a backwards C shape, or a horseshoe shape.
 Your last knuckle should lie just before the seam.
 Your thumb should be directly in line with the gap between your index finger and middle finger.
 There should be a gap between the baseball and the palm of your hand. This will minimize friction as you release the ball thus adding velocity.
