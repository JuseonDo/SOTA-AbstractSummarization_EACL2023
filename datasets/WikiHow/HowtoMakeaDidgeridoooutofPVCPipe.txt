 The length will determine the pitch of your didgeridoo. It's easier to estimate longer, you can always cut it down. A length of 51.5" (including the mouthpiece) will tune your didgeridoo to a low C.;
, This will make the mouthpiece.
 These tend to send off ribbons and hangnails that will only impede your airways. A wire brush is ideal for this task, but you can shave off excess PVC with a pocketknife if need be.
 Place the coupling firmly onto the end of the pipe. Fit the bushing into the coupling. You now have an assembled didgeridoo!
