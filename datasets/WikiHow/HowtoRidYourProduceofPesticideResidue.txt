Though more expensive, organic produce is grown without the use of artificial pesticides.;
,


Some produce, such as strawberries, peppers, peaches, cherries, apples and greens typically pose more of a risk of having high levels of pesticides.
Avocados, bananas, corn, watermelon, cauliflower and broccoli are some of the produce that typically have less pesticide residue.



Use warm water and wash your produce for as long as you would your hands.
If mild dish washing liquid is available, use a small amount on your fruits and vegetables and rinse thoroughly.



These solutions can be found in the produce section of your grocery store and are effective and safe.



This can be made my mixing one teaspoon of sea salt per cup of water, or by diluting vinegar with water.
Soak your fruits and vegetables in the mixture, then rinse.



Even when you plan to remove the skin from your produce, wash it first to eliminate even more pesticide residue.



Local growers use less pesticides and are also more likely to grow organically. Their produce is often picked fresh.



When produce comes out of your own garden or back yard, you know exactly what you are putting into your body.
