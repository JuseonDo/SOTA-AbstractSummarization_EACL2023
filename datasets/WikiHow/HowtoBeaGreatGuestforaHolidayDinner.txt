 Try to calm your nerves. Be engaging with other guests and remember to smile.;
, Punctuality shows respect and personal responsibility. Arriving too early could interrupt the host's preparations, and lateness distracts guests from their conversations and potentially brings the host away from the party. Neither of these scenarios cast you in a positive light.
 You may ask the host what to bring, but it is bad form to ask whether or not to bring it. The host could feel obligated to say no out of politeness. Some examples of what to bring are wine, champagne, a dessert, or even some festive flowers.
 Be genuine and to the point.
 Keep it about the holiday. Dress tastefully and leave personal drama at home.
 Steer clear of anything that could cause any uncomfortable situations. No discussion of politics, religion, or strong beliefs, even if other guests are engaging in it. If asked your opinion, try to keep it light and diplomatic.
 The last thing the host needs is to be put in a position to explain your actions to their guests.
, Find something nice to say about the food, the house, or environment. Be merry and enjoy!
