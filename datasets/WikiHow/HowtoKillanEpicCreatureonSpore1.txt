 Make sure you have full health, max speed,spit, and other abilities such as charge.;
,, (It is best to save at this point). Join in by charging at the creature and occasionally backing up to spit.If you die,just quit and and go back to where you saved. Eventually, all of your pack/flock members would have died. If the epic creature's health is below 700 continue, but if it is above that, it is best to start over.
 It might take a while, but you have to keep doing this until it is dead. If that doesn't work, keep walking backwards and spitting until you can resummon flock. While they attack it, eat and heal yourself, then join in!
