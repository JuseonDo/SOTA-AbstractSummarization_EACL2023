Push the post or post piece back and forth, rocking it vigorously to loosen the pole.
Pull straight up on the post to lift it from the ground. This method works well for those with a strong grip and with a few poles.
Rent or buy a post puller if the ground is very hard or there are many posts to pull. You may have to straighten bent posts for it to work. A post puller works using a jack-like device to lift the post out of the ground. Some can be powered by hand and others by a power take off drive shaft on a tractor. If you are pulling hundreds of posts you’ll want to rent a powered post puller.

Use a post driver, which is a hollow tube with a weighted end that fits over a metal fence post. It has handles on both sides. You lift the driver and let it fall on the post to drive in the post. They are inexpensive and you can find them at farm stores or hardware stores.
Use a sledgehammer if you don’t have a post driver to drive the post in.
