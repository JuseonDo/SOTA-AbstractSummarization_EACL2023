Your brain uses alpha waves and beta waves (conscious/sub-conscious). You use alpha waves when you concentrate and focus on something and use beta waves when you can just "do it" without "thinking about it". Once you have the song down to this point, you're ready for the final step.
 Now sing the song and let the playing fall to the background. Your conscious will be concentrating on the singing, but your sub-conscious will be playing the song. This can feel a little like an out of body experience where half your brain is actually playing the guitar and the singer in you is using the other half. It's weird at first, but very exciting and fun once you got it down.


Finally, you will be able, with practice, to change roles back and forth (did I hit that chord right? yes, OK the next vocal line goes like...).
Note: it is quite rare for guitar solos and singing parts to occur at the same time (that is by design) don't try to change that when you go to write a song(easier on you anyway).
