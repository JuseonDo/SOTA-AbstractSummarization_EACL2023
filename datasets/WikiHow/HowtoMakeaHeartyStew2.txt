 Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until all tomato paste has been incorporated.

, A bouquet garni is a simple way to hold your herbs and spices in one place, making removal simple after the stew is cooked. Simply put the herbs in cheesecloth and tie one end together with a length of string. Submerge the herb-end of the bouquet into the stew and tie the string to one of the pot's handles to make retrieval easy.
