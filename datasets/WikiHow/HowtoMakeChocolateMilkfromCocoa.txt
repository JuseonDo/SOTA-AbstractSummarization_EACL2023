 An actual measuring spoon is good, but a regular spoon will work as well. Spoon two tablespoons each of sugar and cocoa powder into a saucepan. Start out with equal amounts of each and you can adjust.;
,,,,,, Repeat step one (using a microwave safe mug instead of a saucepan)
2. Place your mug into a microwave and microwave for 20 seconds on high power.
3. Take your mug out and stir your mixture.
4. Microwave one or two more times (stirring in between) or until there are no more lumps.
5. Finish off by stirring in the rest of your milk.
