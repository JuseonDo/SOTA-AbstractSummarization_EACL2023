Can you make it on (date of party)?
How many controllers can you bring for (insert console name)?
Can you bring any snacks (optional)?

, And rent games from Gamefly or other places like that (you can buy games, too, if you want).
, You never know how many dishes you'll use.
 Put the snacks on the tables, pour one cup of soda for every friend, plug up the controllers and pick out the games for the night.
 Don't freak out after losing a game, or be cocky. By doing that, you ruin the party.
