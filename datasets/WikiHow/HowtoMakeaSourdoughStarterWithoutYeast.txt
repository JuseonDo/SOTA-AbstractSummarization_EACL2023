 This container should be able to hold 4 cups, be made of plastic, ceramic or glass, and have a loose-fitting lid. Sourdough starter can/will etch metal, which will foul the starter.;
, For glass and ceramic containers, you can soak them in boiling water for 15 minutes. This method is not recommend for plastic, as some plastics can leach chemicals when heated. For all container types, you can soak in a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 litres) of water for 30 minutes. Be sure to soak the lid as well, and rinse the containers to remove all of the bleach.
 If you don't have a scale, use approximately 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup warm water. Any type of wheat flour (except for self-rising) is fine. The water should be around 100 °F (38 °C). Either measure the temperature with a thermometer or check it on your wrist. It should be bath-water warm, but not uncomfortably so.
, The vigorous mixing should incorporate air into the mixture, which will help the yeast take hold.
, By this time you should see some change. The batter should smell sour and have small bubbles. If not, your yeast culture might be a slow breeder, just give it more time.
, You need to feed your starter every day or two if left at room temperature and once a week if stored in the fridge. To feed the starter, remove 1 cup of starter from the container (either use it in a recipe or pour it down the drain) and add 60 grams of flour and 60 grams of warm water, or 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of warm water.
