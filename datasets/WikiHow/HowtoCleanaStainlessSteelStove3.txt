 Only use paper towel and soft cloths on a stainless steel stove. Harsh, abrasive brushes, like steel wool, will very easily scratch stainless steel., Bleach of any kind should never be used on stainless steel. Chloride products and oven cleaners often contain bleach, which can seriously damage stainless steel., If you just cooked on your stove, avoid cleaning it until it cools down. Wait until your stove is cool to the touch before applying a cleaner.
