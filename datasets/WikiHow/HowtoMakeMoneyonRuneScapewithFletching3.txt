 Willow and maple are VERY cheap on Grand Exchange, so buying them can be faster as there is always supply from those doing miscellania and trying to train woodcutting.
 If you want to train magic, make shieldbows and you can high alch them for a profit.
 Typically strung bows are worth more, but sometimes harder to sell. If you want the money now, unstrung bows sell quicker, but for a lot less.
