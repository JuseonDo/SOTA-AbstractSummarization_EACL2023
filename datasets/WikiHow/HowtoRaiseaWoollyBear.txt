he will start his 'moth process' in early spring, so in that time you should make a cage out of old window screens, and place the cup inside the cage.

 Poke a few holes toward the top of the cup and in the lid for air. Alternately, you could buy a special butterfly habitat, but it will work either way.;
, The woolly bear likes to hibernate in the soil.
, You also may want to make 2 or 3 twigs stand up against the sides of the cup so the woolly bear can climb up the twigs. Just make sure they aren't big enough for the woolly bear to crawl out of the cup.
, Only put in a maximum of 2 in a cup because in their later stages, they do not like to have much company. Just keeping one by itself is great for him.
 Do this every 3 days. It's okay if you spray the woolly bear, too. You will find that if you are putting enough water in the cup, he will start getting a black band if he doesn't have one already, or if he does have a black band, his black band will expand or stay the same. If his black band is smaller, it should get bigger if he's drinking enough water.
, Leave the lid of the cup just laying on top of the cup, but not sealed. A woolly bear cannot lift the lid, but a moth can.
 He cannot survive in a cage.
