@article
 Do not allow any liquid to get inside the housing.;
, If the lens is glued to the housing, do not try to pry it off as that will likely break it. Instead, remove the entire taillight assembly and follow these directions to remove the lens from the housing without damaging it.


Heat a kitchen oven to 200�F (99.3�C), and position oven rack in lowest position.
Line a baking sheet large enough to hold the assembly with foil, and place the assembly on the baking sheet with the plastic lens facing up. Place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove the baking sheet and assembly using oven mitts and carefully, using a flat edged screwdriver, pry the plastic lens from the housing. Remove the soft strings of glue from the edges of the lens while it is still warm using a sharp box cutter.
,, If necessary, apply a second line of glue when the first one dries. You want the crack to be totally filled and even with the surface of the lens. If you apply too much glue, sand off the excess using #200 fine grit sandpaper.
