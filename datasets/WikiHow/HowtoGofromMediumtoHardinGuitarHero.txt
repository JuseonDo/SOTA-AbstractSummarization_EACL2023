@summary
before you can even think about going on to hard mode, you must beat "through the fire and flames" in medium.

@summary
after beating it, you'll need to learn how to use all five frets.

@summary
now go into practice mode and work on "hit me with your best shot" in hard mode.

@summary
if you can get up to 85% in practice mode, try doing it in quick play.

@summary
you need to start hitting the back button instead of tilting the guitar.

@summary
try getting 96% in a song in medium, then try that song in hard mode.

@summary
start a hard mode career and get up as far as you can.

@article
 If you can beat this song, then you will easily get to hard mode. If you can't beat it then keep practicing.;

Now you can have your hands like this:
Green = Index Finger
Red = Middle Finger
Yellow = Ring Finger
Blue = Pinkie Finger
Orange = Use your Pinkie Finger to reach over.
Or you can have you hands like this:
Green = Use your Index Finger to reach over
Red = Index Finger
Yellow = Middle Finger
Blue = Ring Finger
Orange = Pinkie Finger. You Decide which position is best for you.
 Work on the song and you should be able to nail the intro and some of the verses and choruses. If you don't get the solo, then that's fine.
 Once you beat it, then you'll be fine.
 It will make you miss less notes.
 You should be able to do it, just make sure they're easy songs like "Slow Ride," "Rock and Roll all Night," and even "Bulls on Parade."
