If you plan to install Skype on several devices, go straight to http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/ and create a bookmark to the page so you can get to it easily later.;
,, Saving the file to your desktop makes it easy to locate.
 Depending on your Windows settings, you may have to give permission for the file to run. Click "Yes" when Windows ask if you want to run the file.
 Skype will guide you through the process of installing the program.


On the "Select your language" screen, Skype checks a box labeled "Run Skype when the computer starts". Uncheck this option if you don't want to sign in to Skype automatically every time you restart your computer. Keep in mind that the more programs Windows has to run at startup, the longer it will take for your computer to boot.
Uncheck the boxes "Make Bing my search engine" and "Make MSN my homepage" if you don't want Skype to make changes to your Web browser.
