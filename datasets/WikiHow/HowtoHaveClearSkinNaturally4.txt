 Eating a generally healthy diet may be linked to having clearer, healthier skin.Base your meals on whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables. Try to eat a “rainbow” diet, including produce of many different colors in your meals – this is a great way to get the vitamins and nutrients you need.
 Stay away from bad fats in your diet, which may worsen the condition of your skin.Choose fish and poultry over red meat, remove poultry skin before eating, and cook with olive oil instead of butter.


Nuts like walnuts and cashews have lots of good fats and make a great snack.
 Eating refined carbohydrates like sugar and white breads may be detrimental to your skin’s health. Limit sugar in your diet by minimizing how many sweets and colas you have. Opt for whole grains like whole wheat pastas, breads, oats, and quinoa.,, Exercising regularly can make your skin glow.An aerobic workout increases your heart rate and breathing rate. Walking, slow jogging, biking, and swimming are good options. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity at least 5 days per week.Be sure to wash your face after your exercise routine – sweat and dirt can clog your pores.
 A nutritionist can help you learn what kinds of food are both good and bad for your skin. A naturopathic doctor can give you great advice about getting clear skin while remaining completely natural. They even have their own skin care products which are all natural.
