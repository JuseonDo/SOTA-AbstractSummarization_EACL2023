 Consider marking the area with a pencil, to ensure accuracy.


Make sure that the pot rack clears any other shelves and is not too close to the stove or grill area.
 Carefully screw the hook into the ceiling. You should either screw your hook directly into the wood of a rafter, or use an anchor. You don't want pots falling on your head!


You can use dry wall anchors and anchor screws to make your rack secure. You need your hook screwed into something solid enough to hold a little weight - which sheetrock and plaster alone are not. Consider using 4 spaced hooks, rather than one, it will give your finished product much better stability, and you can use smaller hooks.
