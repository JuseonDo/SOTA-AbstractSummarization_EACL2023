 The following plants are at special risk of catching alight near open flames:


Australian natives - on the whole, these will contain too many volatile oils, for example, eucalyptus, wattles, bottlebrush, grevillea, etc.
Plants with crisp leaves, such as cordylines
Any plants with brown leaf foliage build-up, including build-up on the ground area around the barbecue (sweep away!)
Ornamental grasses, for example, pampas grass;
, Examples include:


Plants with waxy or glossy foliage (often subtropical varieties)
Agapanthus
Fruit salad plant/monstera deliciosa

, Locating it over pavers, concrete, etc. next to stone, brick, etc. walls is preferable.
 Keep plants trimmed, remove dead plant matter regularly, and cut off any overhang that comes anywhere near the barbecue facility.
