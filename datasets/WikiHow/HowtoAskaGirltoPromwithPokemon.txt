 Could be a close friend, someone you like, ideally you will want this person to be somewhat interested in Pokémon to get the full effect.;
, Be sure to be subtle about it. Just bring it up in casual conversation. Do this a good while away from prom, so she doesn't suspect anything.
 You need three days for the entire plan to play out smoothly.
 Cut out three pictures of her least favorite starter, and attach a piece of paper that reads, "Aw, it got away," to each.
 Once she picks one, grimace and say, "Better luck tomorrow."

, Replace the pictures with those of her next favorite starter, captioned, "Shoot! Close!" Only do this with two Pokeballs this time.
 After she picks, smile and say, "I guess you get to find out tomorrow."

, In a single Pokeball, add a picture of her number 1 favorite starter, with the text reading, "Will you go to prom with me?"

,


Rejection. Don't beat yourself over her "no." Keep in contact in hopes of next year or to not make the relationship awkward.
"Yes!" If she says yes. depending of what you made for her proceed to apply it to her in an appropriate manner. Then you are done asking and your confidence goes up.
