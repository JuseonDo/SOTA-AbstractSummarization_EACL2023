 Choose something like a coffee can, a yogurt bottle, a plastic food container, etc. Wash and clean the container, allow to dry completely.
 Pull the end of it over and around the container. This will keep it intact.
 Sprinkle a layer of approximately 2 tablespoons of grass seeds.
, Tie a knot with it to enclose the soil. Ensure that it is firmly in place.
 The knot should be at the base of the container.
 Draw on any other features. Use waterproof markers and glue as the features will constantly get wet.
 Soak it well to ensure it is completely wet.
 Keep watered.
 Within a week, the grass will sprout and continue to grow.
 To keep the grass buddy neat, trim regularly.
