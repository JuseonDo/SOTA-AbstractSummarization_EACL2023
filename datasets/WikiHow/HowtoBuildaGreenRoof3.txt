 This must be laid first and unless you're absolutely certain of what you're doing, it should be fitted by a professional roofer.
 This also serves as a drainage layer. While the materials used will vary depending on your location, typical layers used include pumice, peat, clay, mulch (spray mulch), florist foam, polymers, etc.Ask the roofer for advice.
