,, Be sure to list the time and dates that your yard sale will be starting and ending.
 Write the address of the sale and make sure the address is readable and stands out. Larger print or bold or contrasting marker color will accomplish this.
 Give no more than one or two examples, if any, of the items that you are selling. Remember, people are driving by and may not be able to read the information.
 Place them on corners of busy streets (intersections), or where there's a lot of traffic near your home.
