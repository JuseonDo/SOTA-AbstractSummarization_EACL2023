 Place a sifter over a small tea bowl and measure out the matcha powder into it. If you do not have a matcha scoop, measure out 1½ teaspoon (2 grams) of matcha. Gently tap the sifter to sift the tea into the bowl. This will break up any clumps and give you a smoother matcha in the end.


Usucha is a thinner type of matcha tea.;
, Do not pour the hot water into the tea bowl with the matcha yet.
 This will help prevent the matcha from clumping. The hot water will also have warmed the tea cup up for you, making it ready for the tea. At this time, you may also want to dry the tea cup with a clean towel.



This will give you a foamy tea. For a smoother tea, use circular motions.
 This tea is not brewed like regular teas, so the tea powder will eventually settle to the bottom of the cup.
