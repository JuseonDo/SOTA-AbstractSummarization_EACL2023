 Do not limit attempts at exercising to routine programs. Any form of physical activity counts as exercise. Be creative in ways to get your children moving.
 Bike riding, swimming, hiking and boat-rowing are all activities that will strengthen muscles and burn calories. Your children will consider this a day of fun rather than looking at it as a form of exercise.
 Karate, dance and gymnastics are examples of activity lessons that your child will get exercise from.
 Basketball, soccer and baseball are effective ways to get kids moving. Keep in mind that in todayâ€™s society, girls are just as able as boys to join a sports team. If you are not a fan of co-ed teams there are some all-girl teams available in the sports area as well.
 A trip to the zoo will result in a day of walking. A water park will result in a day of walking and swimming.
 Have family or friends meet at a park for a day of picnicking and a sport event such as kick ball or relay races.
 Walking the dog or carrying items up and down the stairs force children to get moving.
 Your children will love the unity it brings as you build good memories together.
