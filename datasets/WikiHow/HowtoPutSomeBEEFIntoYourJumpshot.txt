@summary
'b'-balance: keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your shooting foot slightly ahead of your non-shooting foot.

@summary
'first e'-eyes: choose a target - it could be the front of the rim, the centre of the hoop, or the basket as a whole, and focus only on that.

@summary
'second e'-elbow: cock your elbow back to a 90Â° angle and look at the back of your wrist.

@summary
'f'-flick or follow-through: straighten your elbow and release the ball by flicking your wrist, which gives the ball some backspin.

 If you're right-handed, your shooting foot is your right foot. If you're left-handed, then your shooting foot is your left foot. Make sure your entire body is aligned at a square to the basket.;
, Don't watch the flight of the basketball, or your hand as you release the ball.
 If you can see wrinkles, then you have your arm in the correct position. Rest the ball on the pads of your fingers with the centre of the ball on your index finger, then place your guide hand on the side of the ball and make sure that it doesn't slip underneath it. You will not be using that hand to help shoot the ball - it is there to make sure that the ball doesn't fall off your hand before you shoot it and nothing more.
 You should look like you're reaching into a cookie jar that is on a shelf above your head.
