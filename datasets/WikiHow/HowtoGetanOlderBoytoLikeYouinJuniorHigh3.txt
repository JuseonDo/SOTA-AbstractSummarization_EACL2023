 Boys his age are very influenced by their peers. If his buddies don't approve of you, your chances of being with him are very low. If his friends are okay with you, then you have a clear shot at becoming his girlfriend.
, Many boys are way too shy to ask you out, so why don't you just ask him out. Don't follow the old fashioned way that boys have to ask girls out, c'mon, it's the new generation! 2015!! Ditch the old fashioned way and ask him out yourself. In fact, many boys like confident girls who make the first move. This will help him feel less awkward and insecure.
