 Online public school classes are free and become part of your regular class schedule. Different schools have different approaches, but generally the coursework is available online, and assignments and tests are also turned-in and taken online. Classes, curriculum, teacher contact methods and interaction levels, and student-to-student interaction also differs from school to school. Research the schools and see which are most appealing to you.;
, Research the schools offering online classes (see Sources and Citations, below) and determine whether you want to stick to taking supplementary courses, or ditch traditional school for full-time online classes.
 This is the fun part! Read the course description details at the school websites. Make sure you are following your own student education/occupation plan (SEOP) and graduation requirements for your school. Contact your school counselor for details about what you need to graduate.
 Each school has their own enrollment procedures. Follow them carefully to ensure that you can get into the class(es) you desire.
 Because there is no classroom time, you will have to make time to learn and do assignments outside of your regular public school hours. This will require some motivation, self-control, and self-pacing. Plan ahead so you don't get behind and end up struggling to catch up in your online classes.
