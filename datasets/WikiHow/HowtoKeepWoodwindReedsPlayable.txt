fill the bottle with about 1/4 hydrogen peroxide and 3/4 water.

@summary
soak reeds in the mixture as you would usually.

@summary

@summary

 Any small bottle with a tightly sealing cap will work, but it probably must have a screw-cap since the hydrogen peroxide will tend to produce gas (Oxygen -- very small quantities and of no danger) which will pop the lid of snap-cap bottles and leak. You don't want leaks because hydrogen peroxide will bleach and deteriorate most clothing/case linings/etc.;
, The proportions are not critical. Over time, you will lose some liquid -- refill with straight hydrogen peroxide until the liquid gets cloudy; at that point, it is time to start over with new water/hydrogen peroxide.
 If you have previously-played reeds, the first time you put them into the mixture, it will foam a lot. New and/or clean reeds will not foam very much. The foaming is from the removal of the "gunk" (food particles, dried saliva, mildew, etc.) that build-up on reeds.
, For tubular reeds, a reed brush can be helpful for cleaning the inside. Simply wiping off the outsides of the reed with the fingers or with the lips is sufficient for external cleaning.
