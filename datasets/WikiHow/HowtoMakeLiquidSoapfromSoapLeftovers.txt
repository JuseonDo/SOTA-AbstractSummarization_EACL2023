 These are the pieces that are hard to hold and use anymore.;
, Use a grater if it's not too difficult to hold them against the grater.
 Wash out the finished sauce bottle for an easy squeeze bottle.
 You can use freshly squeezed juice or juice from a bottle.
 You can find this at the pharmacy.
 If the squeeze bottle might melt with hot water, do all of the mixing in a safe container first and pour into the squeeze bottle after it has cooled.
 This will give the soap time to dissolve. Shake now and then.
 Once the soap has dissolved, you can now use the reconstituted product as liquid soap. Easy!
