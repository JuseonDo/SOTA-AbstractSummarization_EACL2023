 The type of snow impacts whether or not you should even be out riding. If the snow is crusty and icy, do not ride in it. If the snow is nice and light and fluffy, then it's perfect.;

Your horse should have shoes on, as they add traction.
 If you're a beginner, have someone else show you what to do.


Wear warm clothes.
