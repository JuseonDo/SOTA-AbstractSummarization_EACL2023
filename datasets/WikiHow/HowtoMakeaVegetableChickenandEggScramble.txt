 Place the potato in and cook until it is soft and you can poke through without much resistance. It should take about 5-10 minutes to soften up.;
, Adjust your quantities depending on how many people you want to serve; 1/5th of each of the vegetables should be enough for one serving.
 Grab another chopping board and a clean knife, and chop it up. One whole chicken breast is enough for one or two servings.
 Preheat the pan. Once the oil is spread neatly around the pan and it's hot, add the chopped up chicken and cook it 3/4th of the way through.
 Once it’s cool to touch, chop your potato into small portions.
 Once it's preheated, place the potato and chicken in first just until they start to crisp up. Then follow by adding the peppers, zucchini, squash, and tomatoes. Cook them to your preference. Most individuals prefer their vegetables a little bit softer so cook a little longer. Add salt and pepper to taste.
 Crack them into a bowl and whisk with a fork until they are beaten.
 Mix them in until the egg is cooked. Pull off of the heat immediately and serve.
