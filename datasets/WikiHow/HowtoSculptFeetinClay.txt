 Study the way that feet are both under the skin and with skin. Look at the bone structure, the muscle structure, and the way that the skin sits over these structures.;
, If you need reference while sculpting, they're very useful!

, This can help you when sculpting feet by giving you a 3D perspective, as well as being able to take it apart, and feel it.
 Get the easier part of the foot in place before attempting the toes, and the muscle ripples and bone structure.
,, If too thick, remove clay; if too thin, add more clay in and smear into shape.
 Use a sharp tool to make incisions. Gently pry the toes apart and smooth them into real toe shapes, separate from one another.
 Use a small knife or sculpting tool to create toenails. Take your time as this is painstaking.
