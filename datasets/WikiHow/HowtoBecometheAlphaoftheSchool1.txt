 Then go through the list and do ratings on how well you know them. For instance let's say this girl named kiki is a current alpha, lets say I helped her ace a test so that would probably be a half star. Get it?;
, You have to have time for your friends. But be sure that you are seen with your other alpha friends!

, Also try to keep in shape.
 This is ever so important. If they can't read a note then, you're in trouble!

, Something that you enjoy and people know you for such as singing or writing good columns in the school newspaper.
 Don't copy them, just follow their lead until you get it then... make your break for a chance to be an Alpha, and start your own fads.
