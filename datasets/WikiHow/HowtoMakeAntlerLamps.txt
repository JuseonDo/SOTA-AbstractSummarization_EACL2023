Place an inverted, large antler close to the top of your lamp. This antler will secure your light socket.






Drill a hole through the other side of the inverted antler. This will be a path for the lamp cord to pass through.






Position one more antler that reaches a little higher than the large, inverted antler. This will serve as the piece that will hold the lampshade.
 This will enable you to work on your antler lamp without holding all the pieces together yourself.



Feed the cord through the hole you drilled in the antler.
Pull the cord gently until all of the cord has made it through the hole.
 Use a soldering gun to permanently fix all the antlers together in your desired arrangement.
