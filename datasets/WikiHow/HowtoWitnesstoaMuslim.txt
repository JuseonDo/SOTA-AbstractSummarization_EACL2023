,,,, (For example: many Muslims have difficulty understanding the use of the terms Son of God and Son of Man. Most will argue Jesus, who is considered a prophet in Islam, never said "I am The Son of God". This is said, because the term "son of God" was commonly used at that time to refer to the common men owing ones existence to Father God. Jesus often referred to himself as "The Son of Man" - a significant title identifying as the perfect man to take the special role of savior of the people He had come to save. Another example, Islam claims the Prophet Muhammad was foretold in the Torah and Bible: God had said to Moses:Â "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I will put My words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him" Deuteronomy 18:18. Christians say this was completely fulfilled in Jesus in John 1:45, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." This verse clarified that no one such as Muhammad was spoken of, as it was already fulfilled and refers only to Jesus. Differences of understanding like the aforementioned may be similar to what you may encounter when witnessing to a Muslim.
 Eg: Why is it so important to honour Muhammad as both the last and greatest of all God (Allah)'s Prophets, etc?

, Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Sons of God" (Matthew 5:9). Point out that Jesus/Isa is the Prince of Peace in the Bible. He calls his followers to bring peace to conflict or peace will have little meaning. We may intervene or interfere in warlike situations. We are to bring love and peace, joy,... with us -- Why?: "...brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you" (2 Corinthians 13:11).
