@summary
get close to 'the fox'.the aim of the game is to get to "the fox" without it seeing you.

@summary
however, if "the fox" turns round, the other players must freeze in their position.

@summary
the 1st person to tag the fox without being seen wins that round and then becomes "the fox" and the game is continuous until you decide to finish.

 "The fox" then goes and stands by a wall or on an imaginary line. The others go to the opposite side. Make sure the "the fox" is not facing the others.;
, When "the fox" isn't looking, the others must run or walk to get closer to the fox. Seems easy, doesn't it?

, If the fox sees them moving, the person/people who were moving go back to the start. Remember if you are seen moving, you must go back to the start even if you didn't think you've moved!

, Count up who won the most rounds and declare a winner!
