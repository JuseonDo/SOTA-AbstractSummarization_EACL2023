 This is another way of "greening" your energy by reducing your usage of it. Purchase appliances that use less power (many countries have star or energy ratings for appliances) and buy less of them.
 The less power you're consuming, the less energy you'll need to pay for and the less carbon dioxide emissions your home will be making.
