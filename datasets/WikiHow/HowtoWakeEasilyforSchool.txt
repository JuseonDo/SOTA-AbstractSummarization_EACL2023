if you eat breakfast at home, plan to have something dry the night before as this saves you from having to look through the cabinets in the morning.

 Teens need at least 7 hours of sleep, and 8 or 9 would be preferable. The older you are, the less sleep you need. So, in order to awake, say at 6am, you'll need to be in bed by 10:30 pm at the latest.;
, By doing that, you won't be stressing while going to bed about what clothes you'll pick in the morning.
 This can quicken the time. You won't have to go through millions of drawers just to find some lotion.
 Does a parental unit awake you? Sometimes they don't wake up as well: they're humans, you know. Make sure your alarm clock is set to go off at the correct time. Have it tuned to your favorite radio station for fun songs in the morning! Another alternative is an iHome for an iPod. You can wake to your iPod music instead of beeping or the radio.
 If you're a person who reads at night to fall asleep, it's better if you conserve your reading for another time. Books can drag on and on, and you'll lose track of time!

, Write it out on a sticky note and post it near your bedroom door. Such as: Wake up: 6am; Get dressed: 6:10; Eat breakfast: 6:15; etc.
, Also, don't go back to sleep.
