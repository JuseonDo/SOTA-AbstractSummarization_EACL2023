, What about giving "D:\Training\RaspberryPi\MATLAB\Playground" a shot?, There are at least two ways to do this:

Either open MATLAB, choose "New Script".



 


Or use Notepad++ and build an .m file.
 Save it with a name for example "1_BlinkingLED.m" (WARNING: in MATLAB, avoid using space in file name).





mypi = raspi;
for i = 1:10
   writeLED(mypi,’led0’,1);
   pause(0.2);
   writeLED(mypi,’led0’,0);
   pause(0.2);
end
