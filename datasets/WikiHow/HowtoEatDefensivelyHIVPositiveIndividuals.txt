 It it not wise to keep prepared foods for long periods of time as this gives bacteria the opportunity and time to multiply.;
, Foods should not be partly cooked or raw. It is safer to eat foods that are cooked fully, as exposure to high temperatures for longer periods will kill off any viable bacteria present in the foods.
 Vitamin C can be found in fresh fruit such as oranges, lemons, or any other available fruit or vegetable.
 If there is any evidence that the water may be contaminated, always boil before use. Contaminated water may contain harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella, and for an immune-compromised person, this may result in a life-threatening disease.
 Most of the nutrients and nourishment in these types of food has already been destroyed through the artificial processing.
 Untreated milk may contain bacteria such as Brucella, which can kill a healthy human being. Cheese containing molds or that show evidence of aging, should be avoided at all costs. This may contain fungal elements that will take over your immune system and make you sick.
 Ask your health professional for advice as to what to take.
 Remember that dust particles will have natural airborne spores, causing illness to a person whose immunity is compromised.
 If you have any doubt regarding the types of food or food products to be eaten, seek advice.
 So long as you take care and adequate precautions to eat defensively, you should be able to eat without concern.
