, Keep in mind there is a lot of biased information both supporting and discouraging the diet, neither side is necessarily right. You need decide for yourself whether this diet is for you.
 What to beware of: foods containing sugar or any form of sugar, such as molasses or honey; foods containing white flour; and especially avoid hydrogenated fats, also known as trans fats - they are artificial fats that damage your health. The US Government urges everyone to consume as little trans fat as possible.
 If a box is unopened, such as a box of crackers, donate it to a local homeless shelter. If it's been opened, offer it to a neighbor or just dump it in the trash.
 Meaning buy meat, low carb dairy products (cheese, butter, cream), green vegetables and low sugar fruits such as berries.
 Write down good-for-you protein sources such as water-packed tuna fish, turkey bacon, chicken breasts, and eggs. Don't forget to include low-carb veggies, such as lettuce, mushrooms, and cucumbers.
, Congratulations, you're on your way!

, For example, you can now have: Greek salads, lean meats, lean sausages, steaks, roast chicken, herbed pork chops, unsweetened berry snack in whipped cream (or with zero-calorie sweeteners), sugar free flavored gelatin with whipped cream.
 Have French-style green beans not whole. Avoid most fruits except strawberries and some tomato. Vegetables are not unlimited. It is a healthy, luxurious way of eating.
