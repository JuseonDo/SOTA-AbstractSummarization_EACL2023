, Alternatively you can click the button on the top left of the screen that says 'download (manual)', If it is in the default place, it would be under C:/Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data. Download your files here. You may need to adjust some files around into their correct subfiles e.g. SKSE scripts must go in the SKSE folder, On the launcher click 'Data files'. Your mod should be in this list. If it is not make sure the .bsa and .esm (or .esp) is in the Data folder. Tick the box to load the mod, then play.
