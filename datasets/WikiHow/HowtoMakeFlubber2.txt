pour 1 cup of liquid starch into the glue mixture.

 Add several drops of food coloring until it is the desired color.
 Stir thoroughly. When the glue and liquid starch start to mix, they should become very thick.
 The starch is what makes the glue stretchy rather than sticky. Be aware that Gak will stick to clothes and carpets, but it comes out very easily with a little warm water and some scrubbing.
