,, If you have an uneven skin tone (redness, light or dark patches etc.) use either tinted moisturizer, light foundation or a BB cream. For young skin, a BB cream works best because it moisturizes, protects and covers blemishes without looking thick and cakey. If you don't have naturally rosy cheeks, apply a small amount of blush (not a shimmery blush). For your eyes, use a primer (or concealer) on your lids to make your eye makeup last longer. If you would like, use a natural colored eyeshadow and/or eyeliner. Curl your lashes and apply a black or brown mascara, but make sure you don't put too much on. Also never forget a little bit of clear or tinted lipgloss.
,, This is optional, but you should have your hair trimmed every six weeks to prevent split ends and to help promote hair growth. If you have a picture of a hair style you like, take it to the salon and they will be able to do your hair similarly.
 Paint them a nice colour, or do a French manicure. Paint your nails with clear base coat polish or a French pink, and paint White tips on the top of your nails. YouTube has many tutorials on nail art and manicures that are simple and easy to do.
 It's better than shaving although takes more time and hurts a bit more. It's worth the pain! Not only does your hair vanish, it takes off any dead skin on the surface leaving your legs feeling gorgeous! Remember to wax at least once every 3 months or it'll hurt more the next time and your hair will grow back.
