 This will make about a dozen cookie shaped shower steamers.;
, Put your baking soda and citric acid through a fine sieve just to make sure there are absolutely no lumps. This really makes a difference, so be vigilant!

, Perhaps you want to add flower petals from your garden, or to make lemon poppy cookies you can add poppy seeds or crushed herbs. Mix this up well. Use a fork, it is easiest to mix well and clean after.
 Shake well! Spray your dry ingredients three times and mix quickly. Do this until you can pick up about a spoonful and squeeze it together without it crumbling. It will not form a shape easily in your hand so don't worry about that.
 Let dry overnight, and when you take your next shower place one on the floor in front of you, with you in between it and the spray. Let the steam do most of the work, if you don't like a very hot shower you can let the spray hit it every now and then to release a burst of oil into the air. As it melts, it will run over your feet and leave them nice and soft, too.
