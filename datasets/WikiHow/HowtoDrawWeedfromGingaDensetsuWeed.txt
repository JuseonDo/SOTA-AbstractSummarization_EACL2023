 In fact, make it a little like an oval.;
,, These shapes should look like the front of a mailbox. Then add two pupils. We'll make these more detailed later.
 For shine effect, draw a line dividing the top from the rest of the nose. Keep this white. Then split the other half down the middle and shade the right-hand-side gray. Color the other side black.
 Erase the top. Then, connect each side of the muzzle to his forehead with outward-sloping fashion. Color all this white.
 Don't draw the other side yet. Add pointy teeth and a tongue. Then slope the other side of the mouth "behind" it.
, Make chest look slightly muscular by drawing a kite shape, but don't connect the corners.
, Make his back legs kind of like the front ones. Make his tail bushy and curly. Draw socks on his back legs too.
, Add little spots of white for shine effect.
 Add any additional touches. Congratulations, you just drew Weed!!
