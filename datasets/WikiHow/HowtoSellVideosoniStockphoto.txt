 Sign up as a video photographer. Make sure you read and understand all the requirements for people who submit video clips.;
, Part of the test requires you to upload 3 video clips. These clips will be reviewed by the iStockPhoto staff for quality assurance. If the clips don't meet the company's standards, you can take the test again. You must pass the test before you can begin selling videos on iStockPhoto.
 Anything business related is a good idea because it has a better chance of selling. Use a tripod for your shoot, because any handheld-shot footage may be rejected. Avoid pan, zoom, and other techniques unless you have an experience as a videographer, as a slight camera movement may cause rejection.
 Poor lighting may get the video rejected because it will not look professional.
 Clips should be no longer than 30 seconds.
 Continue submitting videos on a regular basis to build up your portfolio. The more videos you have, the more likely someone may download one of yours, which can earn you a commission.
 Don't be discouraged if it takes awhile to earn a sizable amount of money.
