 Then plug the cable to an electrical source (to wall). Leave this turned off for now.;
, Again, leave it turned off for now.
 Then connect it to the back of the projector.
 If you want to use speakers, connect your speaker cable (usually green) to the back of the projector, where it says "Audio Out". Turn on the speakers.
 Turn the power on at the wall socket first, then turn on the actual devices.
 If you can't see picture on the screen or it says "No signal", check the RCA Cable connection or press the "Source" button and select "Video". If your projector has a button that says "Source Search", push that button and it will search for signal itself.
 You should be ready to watch your film now.
