place your loaf of bread on a foil-covered baking sheet.

 Make sure there is enough aluminum foil to cover and wrap the bread.;
, Do not cut through to the bottom of the loaf.


Use a criss-cross pattern with 1‚Äù (2.5 cm) spaces between the cuts. When you have finished scoring the bread, it should look similar to a large, round hot cross bun.
