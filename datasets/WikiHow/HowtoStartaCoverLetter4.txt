 Unless they have asked for specific information in the cover letter, you can condense the cover letter from 4 paragraphs to 2, in order to increase your chances of it being read.
 Ask someone else to also proof it before you send it out. Never rely on spell check in any word processing or email program.
 Word formats your text, so it may not align correctly when pasted into an email program.


If you choose to cut and paste, it may show through if you cut or pasted from any other texts, such as the job posting. Text colors, fonts and italics may have a different look in a different program.
 If it is playful, your tone can be more playful. Always err on the side of caution, being more formal than informal.
 They will always trump these general rules of cover letter writing.
