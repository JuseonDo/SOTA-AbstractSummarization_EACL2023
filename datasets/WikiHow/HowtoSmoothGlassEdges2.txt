@article
 Choose a medium-grit sandpaper finish. The larger the sanding bit the more of the edge it will be able to smooth at once.
 You can try placing it inside a clamp, but it is more likely to crack the edge of your glass. Only use this method if you can safely grasp the glass object without coming into contact with the sanding bit.


Be very careful when handling electric tools. Wear gloves, eye protection and a ventilation mask.
 Hold the side edge of the bit against the edge of the glass.
 Rotate it slowly until you have traveled around the entire outside edge.
