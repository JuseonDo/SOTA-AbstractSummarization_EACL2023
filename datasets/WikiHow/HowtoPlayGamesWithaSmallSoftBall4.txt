 The friend must have both his/her thumbs and IFS.(index fingers)

, This can be done, by put both their IFS tips together and the same with their thumbs.
(dinner tables in this case)

, Now you have to flick the ball with your fingers/thumbs and try to get it in the "basket".(circle) If the ball flies off in the wrong direction, your friend can move their "basket" if they wish.


This game is all about co-operation and teamwork! Make sure there's plenty of room and nobody else or pets in the room! How many baskets can you get? Swap over after a while!
