 The big commitments are easy to identify: working, volunteering, appointments, and activities. Don't forget to put the day to day stuff like laundry, dishes, and shopping on your list as well.;
, Is there anything on that list that you can resign from, delegate to someone else, or hire help with? Are there things you can rearrange or group together to save time doing or getting to? Make the necessary changes to your schedule.
 Any calendar with space to write down what needs to get done will work. Weekly calendars work best.
 Color coding helps to identify the different types of commitments you have.
 Target obtaining services for the time that you need someone on a regular basis to watch your child, usually during your work hours. If money is tight and you have to pay for someone to watch your child, target using a regular service only for your work hours and then promptly pick up your child after work. Hire an occasional sitter for special occasions.
, It does not have to be expensive, but try to vary the activities instead of doing the same thing every week. It will give you both something to look forward to and will relieve stress.
 If you don't have childcare planned well in advance it will be much more difficult to find someone to watch the baby.
, If the child, especially younger children and babies become to used to another person, instead of their parent, they could become more attached to the other caretaker.
 Your children's smile is well worth what you are going through right now.
