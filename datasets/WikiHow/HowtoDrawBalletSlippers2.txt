 Make sure there that there are no marks because when the drawing is finished it will give it a crystal finish.
 Once you have drawn the first curve draw a second one with the left end slightly behind the other curve.
 On the right side of the shoe, do the same process. On the shoe do the same but you won't have to left side because the other shoe will cover it up.
 Draw a sort of long ball at the top of the shoe that will connect both ends of the shoe together, repeating the process for the other shoe.
 To draw them, start with zig-zags from the top of the shoe upwards. Then add some structure by making the lines about an inch thick, maybe smaller depending on how big your shoe is. Do this for both shoes.
 Always remember to colour them all the same way with your pencil so you don't get streaky lines down your drawing.
