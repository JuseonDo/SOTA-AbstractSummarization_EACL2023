, Caltrain fares are calculated by zone. For example, if you plan to travel from San Jose to San Mateo, you will need a three-zone ticket. Know which zone you are going to and from., Remember that there may be lines at the ticket machines., Day passes usually cost twice what one-way trips would cost. The machines also offer multiple-ride tickets, assorted discounts, and parking permits. Multiple ride tickets offer either a fixed monthly rate depending or permit you to ride 8 times for a single price., The ticket machine already knows which zone you are starting in.,, Take your tickets and any change from the machine., There will be machines on the platform to do this., Make sure to wait behind the yellow lines and on the marked platform.,, You do not have to present a ticket to board the train, but conductors periodically check to make sure that all passengers are properly ticketed., There are no fare gates, so you need to remember to look for the Clipper Card tagging machine and use it. If you forget to tag your card when exiting the station, you will be charged the maximum possible fare for journeys from your station of origin. Keep your Clipper Card handy during the journey, as conductors will check that your card is properly tagged when they inspect passenger tickets.
