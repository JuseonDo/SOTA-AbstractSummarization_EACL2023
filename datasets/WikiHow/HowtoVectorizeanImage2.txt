, Click on the Object menu and select “Tracing Options.” The following are settings that you may want to change before you trace your object:


Choose your threshold. A higher threshold will mean more of the darker areas will be turned to black and lighter areas will be turned to white. When you trace an object, it will be changed into a black and white image.
Add blur if you need to help smooth out the edges of the image.
Choose your Path Fitting. The lower the number, the tighter the image will be traced along the lines. It may become jagged if it is too low. Too high and you will lose detail in your image.
Set the Minimum Area. This allows you to remove parts of the image that won’t be part of your final vector image.
Set the Corner Angle. The lower the number, the sharper the traced corners will be.
, Right click on the group and select “ungroup.” Use the Knife tool to cut grouped anchor points apart.
