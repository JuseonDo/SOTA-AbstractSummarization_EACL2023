 You can find these plastic molds at sporting goods stores or hat stores. Some plastic hat frames can be used in either the dishwasher or the washing machine. The washing machine will be rougher on your hat, so check the instructions that came with the mold you choose.
 Spray these areas with stain remover or a laundry pre-treatment. Let the stain remover sit for a few minutes, then rinse the areas with water.
 Don't put anything else in the dishwasher except for other hats.
, If you have a temperature setting use cool or lukewarm water. Make sure not to set the dishwasher to "heated-dry" or similar settings. Heat can ruin or shrink your hat.
