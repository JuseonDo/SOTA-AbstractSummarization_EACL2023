, Separate an egg white from the yolk by passing the yolk back and forth between the two halves of the egg shell. Pour the egg white into a medium-sized bowl and add the water. Beat the egg white and water with a whisk until the mixture turns frothy.

Discard the egg yolk, or save it for another recipe.
 Add the almonds into the bowl, then stir them using a rubber spatula until they are evenly coated with the egg white mixture., If you want your almonds to be sweeter, and more like candied almonds, add 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of white sugar and 3 tablespoons (37.5 grams) of brown sugar.If you want a more complex flavor, add ¼ teaspoon of ground nutmeg., Keep stirring until the almonds are evenly coated with the cinnamon mixture. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often!, If the almonds are grouped together, they may stick and not bake properly.
 Also, make sure that you spread the almonds back out to an even layer—don't leave them piled together.
 If you have any leftovers, store them in an airtight container.
