 Essentially, you look like you are about to crawl across the floor., This arm will be the "stabbing" arm, meaning it will hold the weight of your body. Move it towards your feet, so that the elbow will stab below the rib cage., Basically, you are lifting your legs and head off the floor. Your head should turn towards your non-dominant arm. See if you can balance., Once you've balanced a few times, swing your legs around. Your opposite leg should land on top of your non-dominant arm.You're twisting your body so that your knees will be facing out to the side, but both palms are still on the floor., At the same time you swing your legs around, tip your head down to the floor so you stay balanced., Stay in this position to make it a "freeze."
