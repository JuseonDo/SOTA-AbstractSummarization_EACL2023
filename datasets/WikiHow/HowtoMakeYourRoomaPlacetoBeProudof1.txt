 You can break it up even further (like clothes, books, school stuff, etc) if you need to, but the overall goal is to get the floor picked up and everything out away. This will make the room look a lot better.;
, Take all the sheets off, flip the mattress, and put clean sheets on it. Take the time to really make the bed. Use hospital corners, they really help.
 Then put the stuff away.
 Put everything away that isn't where it belongs. Don't organize anything just yet, that's coming soon. For right now, just get everything cleaned off.
