Water - distilled, filtered, or rainwater are the best choices to avoid adding more chemicals to your body
Lavender oil (optional).
, Mix thoroughly.
 As it moistens, it will become paste-like. The amount you end up using will depend on the type of water used and the size of the bottle. Some water types remove the "slippery" feel, so you'll need to add more.This slippery feel is essential.
 You may wish to use a different type of essential oil; that's fine but be sure to know the properties of the oil and the safety for applying to your skin and for any medical conditions you might have.
 It should feel slippery and it needs to be totally dissolved because any grainy particles can chafe the skin and irritate it during the day.Once the mixture meets these requirements, the deodorant is ready to apply.
 Do not rinse, but simply gently massage underarm so that the skin will absorb the deodorant faster, and to enable it to spread to your entire underarm.
