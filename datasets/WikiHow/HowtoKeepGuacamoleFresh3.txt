@summary
consider sprinkling some lime juice, lemon juice, or olive oil over the surface of the guacamole.

@summary
smooth a sheet of plastic wrap over the guacamole.

@summary
wrap the excess plastic wrap over the edges of the bowl.

@summary

@article
 Try to leave no more than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the guacamole and the bowl's rim.
 This will make it easier to spread the sour cream on top—and scrape the sour cream off later.
 This will help give you an additional barrier between the air (which turns guacamole brown) and the guacamole. It will also give your guacamole extra flavor., Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the bowl. Using your fingers, smooth the plastic down until it is pressing against the entire surface of the guacamole. The plastic wrap will create a sort of seal between the air and the guacamole., If you want, you can place a tight-fitting lid over the bowl. You can also wrap a rubber band around the sides of the bowl to secure the plastic wrap.
 It will taste the best if you eat it the same day, but guacamole can last for up to three or four days in the fridge.
