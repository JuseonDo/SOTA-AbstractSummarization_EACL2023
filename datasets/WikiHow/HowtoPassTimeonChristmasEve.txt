 Estimate the times so you have a better idea. For example, if you know Uncle Joe is coming over at 5:00, put that down! Some ideas are: Watch T.V, read, watch a movie...etc.;
, Or you could do the opposite and sleep in but then you might not be tired.
 Put some blankets, pillows, and maybe a bean bag! Make it creative! It doesn't have to be just for Christmas Eve! Take a bin and fill it with things to do. Magazines, books, and drawing supplies are a good idea!

, The classics are always fun!

, It will get you tired for bedtime. See how many pushups , crunches, and laps you can do in 10 minutes. Try to beat your personal record! Or you can just get up and dance around. Get your body moving'

,, In fact, if you're reading this and it's Christmas Eve, stop and clean your room! Something is messy

, Some Christmas Specials may be on.
,,,,, That always passes time!

, Sit in your room and work on homework. Never too early to get it started!
