 It is easier to maneuver the ball that way and you can get more power and accuracy out of pushes, hits, and drives. With the ball in front of you, there is less risk of your stick rolling over the ball.;
, This can go a long way to improving how well your perform.Take up strength training and work on overall fitness.
 Any type of hit where your lift your stick is an opportunity to get a penalty or to get the ball taken away from you.
 Stepping on a ball or not moving your feet fast enough is something that can be easily corrected, but if not will result in the other team getting a free hit, so just move your feet!

, This gives you a much larger area to stop the ball with and increases your chances of getting the ball greatly.
 Better it go out of bounds then for them to get a direct shot on goal.
 Just trust me on this one, it is much easier to get up on the field this way as there are less players crowded over to the sides and it's easier to maneuver.
 Listen to your coaches and your teammates.
, Channel them down the side, preventing them from passing in towards the middle. Run them out over the backline. They cannot score unless they come into the circle. Watch for the back pass from the baseline towards the spot though.
