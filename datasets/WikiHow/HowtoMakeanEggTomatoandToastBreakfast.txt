, The milk will allow the texture of the egg is be softer and fluffier. Put 1/2 tbsp of oil into pan and wait for the oil to heat up a bit before putting the eggs in.
 If you want ham in your eggs, you can add sliced up ham pieces into you eggs 1 minute after you poured the egg mixture. As you keep stirring, you will end up having scrambled pieces of eggs in your pan.
 There should not be any dried up pieces or brown over-cooked egg pieces in your pan in order to keep the eggs fluffy and soft. As the eggs are done, set them on the side of the serving plate and put in microwave or oven to limit heat loss.
 Cut off the core and seeds of the tomatoes, as we want to get rid of the excess liquid. If you want mushrooms in your tomatoes, chopped canned mushrooms or fresh mushrooms into a similar size as the chopped tomatoes. Prepare black pepper, salt and sugar.
 Slowly and softly put the chopped tomatoes and mushrooms(optional) in. Be careful, some oil will splash out as the tomatoes contain some liquid. Allow the ingredients to sizzle for 30 seconds.
 Then, add some black pepper in to season. You can also add dried herbs in if you want. After cooking for about 4-5 minutes, put the tomatoes next to the scrambled eggs and put them back into the oven or microwave.
 Any kind of bread would be fine. Put the piece of bread into a clean pan without adding any oil in. Heat the bread with medium heat. Constantly flip the bread until it has a crunchy surface and has turned to a slight golden brown color. Toasting bread on a pan is similar to using a toaster, but the heat is more equally spread using a pan. You can still use a toaster if you want. It is almost the same.
 If you have truffle oil at home, the toasted bread will go very nicely with it.
