 The piece should measure 8 cm by 10 cm. Take a piece of measuring tape and trace the measurements onto the cardboard using a pen or a pencil. Use a box cutter the cut along the traced line.
 Using a drill or sharp object, create a hole in the center of the lids. These will create the wheels for the car.
 Take each half of the straw and tape them horizontally across the cardboard piece. Make sure the straws are parallel to the width of the cardboard piece.
 The skewers will act as your axles.
 Make sure that the top of the bottle cap is facing towards the cardboard. This will prevent the lid from catching on the cardboard.
 Make sure the pieces are of equal length. Discard the part of the straw that doesnâ€™t bend.
 Inflate and deflate the balloon a few times to stretch the rubber.
 Place the elastic part of the balloon over one side of the straw. Take a rubber band and wrap it over the elastic part of the balloon with the straw inside.









Blow into the straw to test if the rubber band is tight enough. No air should be able to escape the balloon.
 Flip the cardboard piece over so that the axles are on the bottom. Place the balloon and straw on the cardboard, parallel to the length of the piece. Make sure the end of the straw is hanging over the edge of the cardboard. Tape the end of the straw to the cardboard.
 Pick the car up and blow into the balloon through the straw. Pinch the straw so that no air escapes it. Place the car on a flat surface and let go of the straw. The air will escape the balloon and push the car.









You may have to straighten the wheels a few times to get the best movement.
