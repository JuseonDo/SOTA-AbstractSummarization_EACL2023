Inflate your paddleboard and apply a weight
Listen for a whistling sound - this is a great way to find the general area of a leak.;
, Place a finger on the exact location and dry the area.

Apply soapy water to the suspected area while applying some weight to your paddleboard.
The largest bubbles will form directly above the leak.
This step is important because leaks may be microscopic - invisible to the naked eye.
 The marker serves a visual aid as you prepare the patch.,


Use a marker to indicate the leak source and about 3-4 inches in each direction away from the source.


The patch should extend about 2-4in away from the leak in each direction for maximum effectiveness.


Smooth both the leakâ€™s surrounding area and the to-be-applied side of the patch.
Wipe down the sanded areas with a wet rag to remove any dust residue.
 Use soapy water and then MEK.

The MEK is an industrial solvent that prepares the plastics for a strong bond. Wear proper protective equipment.



Follow adhesive-specific directions! These should be located on the bottle.
Apply appropriate coats to both the marked patch area and the to-be-applied side of the patch (usually 2-3). Wait 20 minutes in-between application.
Test stickiness of glue with a knuckle test - your knuckle should come away cleanly from the glue without leaving a dent.
Be generous in glue distribution.
 Patience and precision are important when placing patch to avoid trapping air bubbles.

When back out on the water, moisture will leak into any trapped air bubbles and increase the likelihood of further air leakage.



Roll the patch in at least 4 directions to maximize surface area adhesion between the patch and the SUP.



The paddleboard should cure in a dry area for at least 24 hours before being inflated and taken back on the water. Moisture will loosen the adhesive bonding and ruin the patch.
