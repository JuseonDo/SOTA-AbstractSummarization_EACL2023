@summary
place the drones of the bagpipes on your left shoulder, with the bag under your arm.

@summary
when there is almost enough air to sound the reeds, strike the bag with your right hand.

@summary
the bag should now be under your arm with the pipes sounding.

@summary
when you need to take a breath, squeeze the bag with your left arm and keep that pressure on when you stop blowing, then take a breath.

@summary
keep practicing.

 Lift the blow-stick to your mouth and blow air into the bag until it is fairly full.;
, Press it with the hand under your left armpit while squeezing it with your left arm.
 You need to blow into the bag via the blow-stick to keep the bag inflated. The bag must stay at the same pressure throughout your whole performance.
 Once you've taken a breath, blow into the blow-stick again and ease the pressure of your left arm, filling the bag back up. This alternates the whole performance; blowing and squeezing.
 This is very difficult, but essential, to becoming a piper.
