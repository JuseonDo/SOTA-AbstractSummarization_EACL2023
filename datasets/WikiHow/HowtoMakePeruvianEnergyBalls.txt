 Toast the seeds in an oil-free skillet over medium flame, constantly shaking or stirring them until they reach a light, golden brown.;
, If the food processor is small, mix the ingredients in small batches.
,, They should be just barely wet. This will prevent the mixture from sticking to your hands too much, which is ideal since the less the mixture sticks the better the balls will form.
 You can make them in any size you want, but ideally, they will end up being about 1/2 each. Add more honey and work it through the mix if it doesn't seem to be sticky enough.
 This step is not necessary, and the energy balls will be fine without it, but if you have the time refrigeration will help to set the honey faster, meaning that there is a smaller chance of the balls falling apart.
