@summary
chorus occurs when you duplicate the signal (some units create as many as 8 duplicates), keeping one in real-time and delaying the other only by a hair.
@article
 This creates a rich almost "underwater" sound. The more delay is added on the secondary signal the more vibrato and "bubbly" to sound will get. This is most common on acoustic guitar and saw it's golden days of usage in the 80's, not to say it's still not widely used today that is.
