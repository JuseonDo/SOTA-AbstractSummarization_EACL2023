 This technique of handcuffing has several variations. Essentially, the suspect interlaces their fingers behind their backs to be handcuffed, locking their wrists and elbows and reducing the effectiveness of any resistance.
 Their palms should be touching and their fingers entwined in a “prayer” position. If the suspect begins to resist arrest, you can either hold the wrists together or hold the pinkies together to restrain them.
 Try not to remove your hands from the suspect's wrists; as they are standing, they could easily run if they get free of your grip.


The chain of the handcuff should be coming out of the back part of the hand and further from the body. In this position, the suspect can’t move their hands under their legs and in front of their bodies., After the cuff is secured, lock the secondary locking mechanism. If your cuffs don’t have one, be sure to double check that the cuffs aren't too tight.A double-locking mechanism is a lock that ensures the cuffs can’t get tighter once they’re placed on the suspect, reducing the risk of injury.
