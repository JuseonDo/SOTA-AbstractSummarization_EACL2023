 When Audacity is open, click on the button near the top with the red circle. This starts recording. Say something, then click on the yellow square. This stops it. Play it back with the green triangle. If it sounds fine, then great. If not, check your settings or try a different microphone.



Notice where you can change the button to start recording. Normally it's F9.
