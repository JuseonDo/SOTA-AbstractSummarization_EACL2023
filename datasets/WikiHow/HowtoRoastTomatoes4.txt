It's a good idea to wear gloves when peeling tomatoes, to prevent the acidity causing harm to the sensitive skin around your fingernails.
, Remove the seeds by gently squeezing each half.
 Spread evenly with your fingers or a basting brush.
 Stick to making a single layer.
, Roast for about 45 minutes. Remove the roasting dish from the oven with care. Ladle out the liquid that has accumulated during cooking, then place the dish back into the oven.
 Every half hour, remove the tomatoes from the oven and ladle out the juices that have accumulated. The tomatoes are ready when they have caramelized slightly and no longer release liquid.
 When 3/4 of a cup is left, spoon this over the roasted tomatoes and garlic in a bowl.
 Alternatively, keep in the refrigerator for up to two to five days, covered.
