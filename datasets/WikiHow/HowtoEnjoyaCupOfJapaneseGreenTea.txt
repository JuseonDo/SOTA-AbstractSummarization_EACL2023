, Instead, bring water to a boil then let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Water temp should be around 60-80 C (140°F - 175°F). Pour water over tea leaves, into your ceramic cup. Water can be a bit higher for other green teas.
 The newer the tea, the less it should steep.
 (Shincha and sencha are best steeped using a filter, then removing filter and leaves from cup or pot.) Smell the tea first to enjoy its pleasant aroma. Then take a look at the bright green color of the tea.
 Let it roll down your tongue and savor the subtle scent of the sweet grass. Slowly, enjoy every sip of your green tea.
 You can repeat the above procedure with the same loose green tea leaves up to three times or more. If using a filter, tea leaves can be infused 1-2 more times.
