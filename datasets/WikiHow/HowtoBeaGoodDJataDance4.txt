basic set compositionÂ : the most basic set composition used by a lot of high school and middle school djs is the triangle composition.

 For this method the DJ will play three similar songs, followed by three different songs. Always sticking to groups of three to allow the crowd to enjoy the change. Here is an example:


First set (Hip Hop): Eminem - Shake That, Akon - Smack That, Kanye West - Stronger
Second set (Dance): Daft Punk - Harder Better Faster Stronger, DJ Alligator - Blow my Whistle, DaRude - Sandstorm

Notice how Kanye West transitions into Daft Punk as Stronger uses samples from Daft Punk.
Use a point where the third song is slower and you do not have an easy transition to insert a slow song, then right after the slow song start bringing them up with something in the middle and moving faster again.
