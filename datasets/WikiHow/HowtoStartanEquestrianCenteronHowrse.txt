@summary
understand that to have a successful ec (equestrian center), you will need to start small.

@summary
if you don't want to start small, plant turnips and resell them for about 6 months.

@summary
,

@summary
buy the basic items to start boarding horses.

@summary
buy droppings until either you hit the limit, or run out of equus.

@summary
go to your meadows and click 'make manure from droppings'.

@summary
go back to the store and click 'resell items'.

@summary
continue doing this every time you can.

@summary
hire a groom.

@summary
once you have enough equus, consider buying the following:

@summary
a racetrack (you need these for competitions)

@summary
a shower (this lets your horses in boarding use 10% less energy in competitions)

@summary
a scarecrow (these are great for adding to a large fertile meadow for cultivating crops)

@summary
,

@summary
if you have a pass, buy a large fertile meadow from the secret market and start growing crops on it.

@summary
set the price of board at something reasonable, so people will board there.

@summary
board your highest skilled horses in your ec if possible.
@article
 Manage it proportionately, so when you incorporate more stalls, hire more employees, and buy more acreage.;
,, Below is a list of what you should start with.


Four 1* box stalls
12 wood chip bedding
6 acre meadow
Two 3 acre meadows.
 You'll need this for earning more equus.
 Make as much manure as possible.
 Resell as much manure as possible. You should earn 40 equus per each manure.
 Once you have a very large EC you should be making equus easily, but before that it always helps to have a boost.
 A groom is always necessary, and you need one groom per 20 box stalls. Always pay the highest wage possible. If you don't get on Howrse often, it is also good to have the contracts be long periods of time.


When you have a fair amount of equus, hire the other employees.
To increase your lesson quality, you need a horse riding instructor (one or more). Start with one.
, Generally the most equus-providing crops are turnips, albeit more pricey to buy the seeds.
 Start with about 15e a day, and if you are gaining a lot of horses, see if it remains the same when you up the boarding price.


If you have to, set the rate at 10e a day. As soon as your boxes are filled (or mostly filled) with boarded horses, up the rate a bit higher.
 This will improve the overall ranking, therefore increasing the chance of other people boarding their horses in your EC. Make sure you don't occupy all your stalls!
