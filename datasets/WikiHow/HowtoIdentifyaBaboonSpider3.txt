@summary
observe the burrow entrance at night.
@article
 The silk lining at the entrance extends out slightly and it sometimes has plant material entwined in it. You aren’t likely to see baboon spiders during the day, for they are nocturnal, but if you locate the burrow of a baboon spider, you can return at dusk to observe its hunting habits.
 They wait at the entrance of their burrows to watch prey approach. They will then ambush the prey and drag it into the burrow. You will most likely see their front legs and their eyes as they sit and wait for prey to approach.
