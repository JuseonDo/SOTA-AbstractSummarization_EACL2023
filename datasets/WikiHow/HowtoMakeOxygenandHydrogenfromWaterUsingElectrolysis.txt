@summary
fill a glass (about 3 in./7.5cm diameter) about 3/4 full of tap water.

@summary
dissolve a tablespoon of table salt in the water.

@summary
place a thin piece of cardboard (a paper plate will work) over the opening of the glass.

@summary
wrap the other ends of the wires around the positive and negative terminals of a nine-volt battery.

@summary
to produce sizable amounts of hydrogen (or oxygen) , continue following these steps; otherwise, you are finished at step 5.

@summary
submerse the smaller container in the larger glass.

@summary
bring the smaller glass' opening toward the water surface, but, again, be careful not to let the opening come out of the water.

@summary
suspend the smaller glass in this position with the clamp/tape/etc.

@summary
,

@summary
insert the hydrogen (negative) or oxygen (positive) wire into the under-water opening of the smaller container.

@summary
,

@summary
leave it until the smaller container is full.

, Salt helps conduct electricity better through water. (However this may produce amounts of chlorine gas due to the chloride anomaly. This will not produce significant volumes of the gas unless massive current is applied.)








, Poke two thin electrical wires, approximately 1-2 feet/30-60cm long, through the cardboard about 2 inches/5cm apart so that one end of the wire is approximately 2-3 inches/5-7cm submerged in the water.
 Bubbles will soon begin to form on the submerged ends of the wires, hydrogen gas on negative wire and oxygen on the positive wire.
 You will require, in addition to the previously stated items, a smaller container (a syringe is best) and something with which to suspend the smaller container upside down (tape works adequately).
 without removing the glass from the water; or, bringing the opening above the water level of the big glass, flip the smaller glass so that the opening faces toward the bottom of the larger glass. (If using a syringe, simply put the opening into the glass and pull the plunger, filling the syringe with water, and skip to Step 9).
 If done correctly, the smaller glass should protrude from the water's surface, but it will be filled with water (it is being suspended by pressure).
