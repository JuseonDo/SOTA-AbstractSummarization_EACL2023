 If you are using film, make the first item in the title be a name of the device you used to capture the image.


Archiving images is important for historians. It is the systematic naming of photos so that they can be used to tell a chronological story about a person, place or thing.
 A camera will usually begin all photo downloads the same prefix, like IMG or DSC. This is actually an advantage to the archivist, because a default image name can be researched at a later date and possibly attributed to a type of camera.
 If your camera lets you choose, use a default camera name of three to five letters to code all downloads from that camera.
 As you take more photos, the camera will count up to new dates or numbers. This is also an advantage because it keeps the photos in a chronological series as you take them.
 You will leave frustrating gaps in your series that will be hard to piece together later on.
 Rather than rename something based on it’s image properties or subjects, copy the image in order to rename it and delete the second copy if you must.
 If possible, use a similar method, with a new letter code at the beginning to indicate the camera model.
