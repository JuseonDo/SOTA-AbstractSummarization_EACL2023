 Set the broiler to its highest heat and preheat. Meanwhile, cut the grapefruit in half along its “equator” line. Cut the grapefruit around the rim of the fruit and along the segment lines. Take a sharp knife and cut some of the skin off the rounded bottom part of each grapefruit half so it can stand without tilting., While the broiler is still preheating, pour a couple of teaspoons of maraschino cherry juice into the grapefruit halves. Then sprinkle each grapefruit half with as much brown sugar as desired.You can also add half a teaspoon of butter if you want a richer flavor.
 After the broiler is done preheating, place the grapefruit halves into a shallow pan and cook. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or a little longer if you want a softer and more golden-brown grapefruit. , Take the grapefruit out of the broiler. Let it sit for about five minutes until it’s warm as opposed to hot.Top with a maraschino cherry if desired. Eat with a spoon.
