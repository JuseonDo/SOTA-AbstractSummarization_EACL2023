look around and see all the exercise that we could be getting right at home.

@summary
while we are working on changing the way that we think, it is important that we all realize the importance of how we eat.

@summary
realize that it is crazy the way that tv portrays things, like someone that wears a size ten, gets down to a size one...like a size ten was too big, not!,

@summary
now that we are done resetting our minds lets look at simple (good old fashion) home chores to stay fit; such as sweeping the porch, pulling weeds by hand, trimming hedges, wiping down the counter tops in the kitchen, taking down curtains and washing them, feather dusting the walls, dusting and polishing furniture.

@summary
now since you are already working out, why not take time out from chores and hop on an exercise bike to take yourself for a ride; then later while relaxing (in front of the tube) do a few simple curls with a small dumbbell...while being proud of all that you accomplished in a days time.

@summary
if you're video-game savvy and enjoy dance games, then why not buy ddr (dance dance revolution) or purchase a wii and wii fit?,

@summary
if you are hyper and bored and stuck at home, jump around the house.

@summary
don't forget, if hopping seems strange or boring, add a hula hoop or jump rope!,

@summary
use tv to your advantage by creating exercise games based on your favorite shows.

 However, we first need to reset our minds, in to getting back to our daily lives - instead of focusing on going to the gym, or spending money on costly exercise equipment.
 Although there are so many new studies that tell us something different everyday about food, we can figure some things out for ourselves, and find a plan that works for each of us as individuals.
 Then to top it off shows us someone claiming to be in a size one, when it is obvious they are much bigger. But naturally, that will get blamed on saying TV adds (ten to fifteen) pounds on you; and if that's the case, then some people on TV look like spaghetti noodles. Plus if that's the case, well some of the Movie Stars that are claiming to be over weight aren't, it's just TV...if they stayed off TV (they would look thinner); therefore, they would lose weight automatically...and a career.
 There is always something to do around the house that will keep you fit; thus you'll have a clean environment in which to live... plus you'll stay healthy and looking good.
, This method is one of the simplest ways to lose weight. Usually, most people tend to enjoy their weight loss experience instead of it being detrimental and periodic routine.
 Literally hop. Anything that causes you to sweat will help you turn body fat into muscle or just burn it off.
 The hula hoop will work your abs & hips, the jump rope is great for cardio. All you need is 15 minutes, but 20 to 30 minutes once a day will really get your heart rate up and those calories burning! After don't eat a lot of food with calories.
 Make a list of things that happen often in an episode, and pair them with activities. Every time something on your list happens on the show, pause it and do the corresponding exercise. There are example games below.
