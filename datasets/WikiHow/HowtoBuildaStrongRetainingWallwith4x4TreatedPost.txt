dig a level trench a foot deep into stable soil.

@summary
add 6” of sand or crushed limestone as a base leveling material.level the trench from one end to the other.

@summary
begin 1st course with a full length 4x4 post.drill two half inch holes through post centered 4ft apart.

@summary
hammer the post in place with rebar through the holes.repeat for the entire length of the wall.

@summary
measure the last post needed.

@summary
check each post level horizontally and plumb vertically as subsequent courses will be affected.

@summary
begin the second course with a post cut to half-length to stagger the joints.

@summary
begin third course/layer with ¼ length post to stagger seams.

@summary
begin fourth course with ¾ length post to stagger seams.begin fifth course with full post again.

@summary
add t-braces to the wall while being constructed for support.use the straightest and most visibly appealing 4x4 posts for the final top course the wall.

@summary
backfill the wall.

@article
 Make the trench straight by staking out the location exactly and using a tight string to make a line between the stakes.
 Compact the base material.

Check base material with a level or measure down from a leveled string line.
Add base material to low spots.
Repeat compacting.
, The word “course” means one row or one layer of the materials of which the wall is made.,, Hammer rebar until flush with top of 4x4 post.,, Transcribe measurement onto a post. Mark line around the post with speed square and pencil, and cut the lines with circular saw.,

Add wooden shims if necessary.


Check posts for level and plumb before nailing.
Use the 4 pound sledge to hammer 60d wall tie nails through the top of the post into the course below.
Install the wall tie nails every 16 inches.
Install full length posts to complete the course cutting only the end post.
 Keep going until the layer is complete.

 T brace sketch


Dig a T shaped trench behind the wall.
Build the T-brace horizontally behind the wall with 4x4 posts.
Incorporate the base of the T-brace by nailing it flush in between two posts in a course of the wall.
Hammer rebar down through the T-brace into the ground.
Bury the T-braces.






Locate all T-braces below the top of the finished wall so as to not become disturbed or visible.
