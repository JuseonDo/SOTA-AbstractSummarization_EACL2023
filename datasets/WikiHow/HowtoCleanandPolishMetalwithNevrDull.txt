 Nevr-Dull is a little oily; it's best to gather what you need (and change into work clothes) before starting.;
, It doesn't need to be large, each piece holds more oil than you might think.
 Depending on the metal's tarnishing you might need to apply a fair amount of pressure to squeeze out more of the oil. Go over each area a few times, rubbing back and forth in small circles or following the metal's grain.
, This should be pretty quick, it should take less than 5 minutes.


While you're waiting, go ahead and return the wadding to the container. It can be reused later.
 Go over each area until the metal doesn't feel oily.
