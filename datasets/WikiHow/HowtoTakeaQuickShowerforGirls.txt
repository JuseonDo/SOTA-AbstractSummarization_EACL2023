 Fold up your clothes neatly, place them next to the shower, and line up all of your things. This saves time because you can quickly get dressed and prepared for the day (or night).;
, You might tell yourself only this little bit, but it is easy to get lost up in your daydreams.
 The hot water also helps to open your pores.
 Most people waste time in the very beginning of their shower because they take too long savoring the warm water.
 This gives your shampoo time to seep into your scalp.
, Keep your face wash on your face for at least 30 seconds to let it cleanse your pores.
 It is best to turn the shower off while doing this, as it saves water. You might be a little cold at first, but think of the planet (and your water bill)!

,, When you are done, let it sit while you brush and floss your teeth in the shower. Be sure to have a cup so you can rinse out your toothpaste.
, Get out of the shower and begin to dry yourself. Start at the top. This way, no water will drip down from your neck or back onto your legs, forcing you to dry the already dry parts off. Also, remember to pat your face rather than rubbing it dry with a soft towel; this irritates your skin.
