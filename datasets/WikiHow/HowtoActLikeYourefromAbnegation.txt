 This is the Abnegation color. Try to wear grey shirts, pants, shoes. Don't over-dress, the Abnegations wear simple clothes.


Wear clothing that is less noticeable. You can wear and brown if you like. In the Divergent movie some people are seen with brown and gray clothes.;
, Try to wear no accessories. Only watches are allowed. The Abnegation are very simple and look down on unnecessary extravagance.
 Female Abnegation usually wear their hair up, in a bun or a knot. For boys, have short hair.
 Strive to follow the manifesto in everything that you do.
 The Abnegation don't look at mirrors because they believe that it supports egotism so try not to look at one directly as much as possible.
 Abnegation are usually quiet, so refrain from making unnecessary comments.


Be quiet and don't attract attention to yourself.
 The Abnegation are selfless people. They don't think about themselves and they are without megalomania. Don't use the pronouns "I" and "me" too much.
 It is a sign of respect and a trait of the Abnegation.
 This is not an Abnegation trait. Do not back stab and talk about others with contempt.
 Help your parents without being asked., If you're in the train station, give up your seat for an elderly man. If you see someone hungry, give your food to them. This is the true Abnegation.


Love your family and friends.
