  Draw a second line at an angle.  Place four pears on the table to create a simple still life.;
,  Hold the marker loosely for wrist movement and freedom of line.  Just draw, not thinking too hard about what you are doing.  If you make a bad line, leave it and redraw a better one.,  Paint the pears.  Apply two colors, yellow and orange to create a unique shade.  While it is still wet, dab or sprinkle on some brown, green or red for texture on the pears.  Do cast shadows, keeping them consistent in color and length. Allow this to dry.
  Use any color, but make sure to show off the pears to advantage. A table cloth can complement the simplicity of the pears., Paint behind the pears, beyond the table's edge.  Look and see what shapes are actually there in the room, simplify and suggest them, if you wish.  Or just paint it a single color. A dark background is very dramatic.,  Or, buy new ones of a different shape and color. Add a new element such as a figurine, soup can, flowers or a piece of driftwood.
 You are almost a pro at painting pears.  Paint a series to discover new things about, not only the still life set up, but about  yourself.  Your skills and confidence will blossom. An amazing journey might begin with one pear.
