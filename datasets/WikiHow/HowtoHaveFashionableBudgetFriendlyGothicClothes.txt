 There are many different looks within this subculture (cyber goth, romantic goth, renaissance goth, etc), and to create an extensive wardrobe you will need to figure out exactly what look you are aiming for.;
, Basics include things like plain black pants, black t-shirts, a black jacket, and black gloves for those chilly days.
 Depending on what type of Gothic clothing you are interested in, this can be a very in depth process. Cyber goths for example, may wear bright neon coloured accessories; while romantic goths may stick to a darker (red, black, grey) palette. Check out the "tips" section below for ideas on how to make your own accessories or where to buy.
