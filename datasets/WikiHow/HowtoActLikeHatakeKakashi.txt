 In the anime series Kakashi gives a chilling impression that you do not want to meet him in a battle. He is always calm and almost never surprised.


Slouch slightly.





;
, Always try to win and take the easy way out. Act very aloof with them and logical.
 If you want to hide your eye use his technique or get a side-fringe to hide it.
 As you can see in the anime he always carries books around. Try to read whole collections of books that interests you.


If your favorite book has been turned into a movie, it's a must-see movie end of story and no questions asked.
, Be amazing at sports, and get ripped. Try your best in every sport.
 This is incredibly important especially at work and in school. This will show people that you are serious on becoming him.


If at school or other places, you can use a face mask. Not only is it not going to raise suspicion, but you can wear it all the time. If people ask you about it, tell them stupid or unbelievable reasons like Kakashi does.
 Kakashi is always serious and never makes unnecessary jokes.
, Kakashi always acts half asleep but in truth he is always alert for the slightest thing out of the ordinary.



Blow off people that make a big deal about things.



When fighting, analyze and copy your opponents moves.
,, That way you can put your mouth-covering on again before anyone sees what you look like.
 If someone asks something about you, don't get into too much detail; try to change the subject.
, Kakashi spies on Naruto and other people all the time.
