 This keeps bad smells from being trapped in your home and settling into the carpet.


Keeping your home ventilated will also limit the humidity, which is important for preventing smelly mold and mildew from growing in your carpet.
 Make sure to take out the trash, wipe surfaces with disinfectants, and most importantly, vacuum weekly. Regular cleanings keep bad smells from forming and sticking around. This is especially important if you have a pet, whose presence can often create a bit of wear and tear on your carpet., When smoke is kept inside a room or a building, it has no way to dissipate properly and as a result, it gets absorbed into carpets, walls, and furniture.
 Timing is vital when taking care of spills and pet urine. The quicker you run to the liquid with a roll of paper towels and begin extracting as much as possible from the carpet, the less odor there will be to soak in and linger.
