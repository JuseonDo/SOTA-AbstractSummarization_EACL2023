 Calamity's mane is described as being bright orange. This will act as the base of the costume.;
, Wear them over a pair of grunge jeans.
, As you've probably noticed, this guide is aiming at using one particular shade of brown. Calamity's coat is a rusty brown color, and thus this is the influence of the main color choice.
 What would Calamity be without his recognizable hat, which he doesn't even take off for sleep?

, Calamity's weapon of choice is a double-rifle battle saddle. Seeing as how this is rather impractical for a human, it's alright to simply dual-wield.
 If you want to create an anthro costume, you could always add wings.
