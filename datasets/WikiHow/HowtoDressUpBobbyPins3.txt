 This way, you won't risk accidentally gluing your bobby pin to the paper. The paper will help keep the bobby pin from rolling around while the glue dries.


If you can't find and index card, a piece of cardstock or even ordinary printer paper will do.
 The flat side of the bobby pin is technically the top, but many people like to wear bobby pins with the bumpy side facing out. Choose a side to work on, then set your sheet of paper with the bobby pin on it down.
 Gemstones and rhinestones are popular, but you can also use other small items, such as: cabochons, vintage earrings, flat buttons, fabric flowers, and so forth. Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is small or lightweight. A large, fabric flower should not be a problem, but if you are going to use something heavy (like an earring or cabochon), choose something that is ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) or smaller.


If you are using a vintage earring, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the post off.
Create your own design! Glue a cabochon to a filigree button, or glue a few beads together to make a flower.
 Ordinary craft glue is not recommended, because it is not strong enough. Hot glue may work in a pinch, but your gemstone may break off.
 This way, your gemstone will be less likely to fall off. If you really want to, however, you can glue your decoration to the very tip, but be aware that it may break off.
 How long you wait will depend on the type of glue you are using. Super glue may dry in just a few minutes, while an industrial-strength glue may take up to several hours. Read the label on your glue for specific drying times.
 At this point, your bobby pin is now ready to wear! If the gemstone you added is still loose, consider cutting a small scrap of fabric, and then gluing it to the back of the gemstone. This will help anchor the gemstone to the bobby pin.
