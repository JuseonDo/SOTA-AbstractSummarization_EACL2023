 Some of them are: Akumal, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Coba, Contoy Island, Holbox, Puerto Morelos, Sian Ka'an, Cozumel. You arrive at first at Cancún International Airport, approximately 31 miles (50 km) north of Playa del Carmen. Riviera Maya has a lot of all-inclusive resorts and boutique hotels as well.;
, Some hotels are better for couples, without loud music and parties at night, just the beautiful ocean sound at night.
 It's completely safe, you put on a wet suit and hard hat to explore the cave system. You might be underground for about an hour and a half.
 The best part is when dolphins glide you through the water, and the part of the program where you can freely swim with dolphins and pet them.
 There are also inlet with clear waters for snorkeling. But one of the attractions is the underground river (don't worry if you're claustrophobic, it's a big space); but you can also try the open river. The ticket price to the park is a little expensive (but worth it). You can eat at the different restaurants around the park; in the evening starts "Xcaret Mexico Espectacular" a Mexican night show, involving Mexico's history, culture and traditional dancing.
