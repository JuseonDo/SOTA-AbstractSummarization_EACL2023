 Make sure the table is free of debris, dust or dirt before beginning the project. Lay out bottle caps or your collection so you can determine if you like the design.
 Once you are happy with the design, glue the caps in place so they won’t move when you pour the resin. Allow ample dry time before proceeding to the next step.
 Secure the base of the barrier with duct tape and/or painter’s tape. You don’t want any gaps so the resin could drip out. Make sure the barrier is high enough around the sides to hold the poured resin.
 Follow the instructions on the resin box for mixing and then slowly pour over the tabletop. If the resin is not getting between the bottle cap gaps, use a knife to gently spread it over the tops and in between the gaps.


Allow the resin to set and dry for up to eight hours (or according to the resin box directions).
 Carefully run the knife around the edges of the barrier to release the tape. Be careful not to scratch the table as you remove the tape and barrier.
