 The Facebook icon looks like a blue box with a white "f" logo in it.


If you're not automatically signed into Facebook on your device, enter your email or phone and your password to log in.
 It looks like three horizontal lines in the lower-right corner of your screen.
 This option is next to a gray gear icon towards the bottom of the menu. It will bring up a pop-up menu.
 It's at the top of the pop-up menu.
 It will open your How You Connect page. Here you can customize your privacy settings to change who can see your future posts, or your profile information.
 You can find this option at the bottom of the Who can see my stuff? section in your privacy settings.
 This is the blue button in the middle of your screen. This button will instantly change the privacy settings of all posts that are currently set to Friends of friends or Public on your Timeline. All of these posts will now only be available to people on your Friends list.
