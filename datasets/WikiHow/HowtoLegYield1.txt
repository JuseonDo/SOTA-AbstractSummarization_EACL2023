@summary
know that the secret to leg-yielding is in timing.

@summary
mount your horse.

@summary
keeping your body straight, when the horse's outside shoulder is up (when you are rising), shift your hips to the outside as though you are going to stand in that stirrup.

@summary
get the horse to take one or two steps at a leg-yield, then allow them to move straight and forward again.as the horse learns the signal, you will be able to perform a leg-yield by simply shifting your weight slightly to the outside

 In order to really get a feel for it, it is necessary to begin without being mounted. Have an assistant in the ring that can have her hands free. Begin by walking in a straight line with your assistant walking on your left. Have her put her hand on your ribcage (approximately the same place a riders leg would be if you were a horse). First, have her push gently on you every time your left foot is on the ground. You will notice that you bend around the pressure, but can continue to walk in a straight line without much trouble. Then, have your assistant begin to push you gently when your right foot is on the ground. You will find that you have to step over in order to stay upright.;
, Start at a rising trot (posting). The signal will come when the horses outside shoulder (the shoulder toward which you want to go, in this case) is up.
 Your inside leg will automatically come in against the horse's side. With a surprisingly small amount of pressure, you will cause the horse to step over (you are acting like your assistant's hand on your side.)

, Make sure to praise the horse.
