 This is just temporary and not necessary, but you may want to trap your snow golem so you can do shear him more easily. A 5x5 area should suffice.


Make sure you build this is the right biome; snow golems will melt in biomes with a temperature greater than 1.0, or dry/warm biomes ;
, Do this by placing two snow blocks on top of each other, and then a pumpkin on top of that. After placing the pumpkin, the snowman will come to life.
