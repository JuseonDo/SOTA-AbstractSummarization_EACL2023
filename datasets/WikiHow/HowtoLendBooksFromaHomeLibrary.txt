 This doesn't mean just looking around and jotting down the authors. Lets go about this systematically. Start in one area of your house (better yet get all of your books into one area). Bring up an Excel spreadsheet and lets get started!;
, Now this can be as detailed or general as you want it to be, but here are a few things to note down and how to do it.
 In different cells type the headings: Author(s), Title, Genre, and Summary. You could also add: Publication Date, Place of Publication, Publisher, and Subject (e.g. vampires, history, Russia, or anything else that you though was important in the book). After these headings add: Loaned to: and Loaned on: (with the date). These heading will help you: better understand what you like, what you have, and where it is.
 Looking at your collection with a critical eye. As you start filling in your spreadsheet, you can reflect on a few things: do you still want to keep this book or should you donate it/give it away, what was that book about (to write a quick summary), do you like a specific genera,...).


If you don't want to create your own catalog on Excel, you can use a number of software options available. A quick Google search of "cataloging software" will provide a number of options. In addition, some websites can allow you to catalog your books online and allow you many more options to share your opinions of your books with a large community of users.
Now you have a list or catalog of your books. Its time to start lending! Decide who you want to lend works to and for how long and off you go! Just remember to type their name into your new catalog along with the date that the book is due back.
If you don't want to use a computerized system, you could also add library cards to the books.
