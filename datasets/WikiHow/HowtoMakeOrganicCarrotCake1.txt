 Grease two 9-inch (23-cm) glass or metal cake pans. Set the pans aside.;
, Heat the two ingredients over medium-high heat until the juice begins to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the carrots are softened.
 Pour the carrot and apple juice mixture into a food processor and pulse until smooth. Alternatively, you can also use a handheld blender to puree the carrots and apple juice directly inside the pot.
 Use the food processor or blender to pulse the raisins and nuts into the puree until they are finely chopped.
 Combine the organic flours, rolled grains, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix the ingredients together.
 Thoroughly whisk these wet ingredients together in a medium bowl.
 Gradually pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture, beating the ingredients together as you add them to make it easier to combine. Beat with an electric mixer for several minutes until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain.
 Gradually fold the carrot and raisin puree into the cake batter, followed by the crushed pineapple. Use a rubber spatula and avoid over-mixing the batter. Over-mixing the batter at this point will make the cake too dense.
 Gently shake the pans to pop any large air bubbles trapped inside the batter.
 The cake should bake for about 35 to 40 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a knife in the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is done.
 Allow the cakes to cool for 5 minutes inside the pans. Then, scrape a butter knife around the sides of the pans to loosen the cakes and turn the cakes out onto wire racks. Let cool to room temperature.
 Use organic cream cheese frosting to frost the tops of both cakes. Stack the cakes together and frost the sides, if desired.
