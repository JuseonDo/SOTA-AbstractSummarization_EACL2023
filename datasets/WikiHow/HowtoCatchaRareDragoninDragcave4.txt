 Ask them to breed you the egg you are looking for in exchange for X or another good egg in exchange for X.
 Do you have a CB semi-common, a pretty dragon line, or a nice name? Can you raise eggs to the hatchling stage? If you can, use it to breed for a trade.
 Eventually you will be able to get the rare dragon you want.
