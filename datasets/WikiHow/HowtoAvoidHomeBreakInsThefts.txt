lock the doors - although this seems obvious, many people still fail to do this.

@summary
close and lock windows - just locking doors is pointless if you do not close the windows when gone.

@summary
don't advertise valuables - you do not have to put a list of your valuables in the classified section of a local newspaper, for a criminal to know what valuables you might have.

@summary
also, just because you don't make it obvious for someone who goes by the home to know what's in it, there are other ways a criminal can determine what valuables you have in your home.

@summary
get an alarm - if you live in a rural area, then these may not be very much use.

@summary
remove hiding locations - criminals love to make an entry in a location that is poorly visible to others.

@summary
park bicycles and vehicles in a garage - if possible, park your bicycles and vehicles in a locked garage.

@summary
add privacy curtains - these thin curtains allow light in, but distort the image of the room.

 This makes it incredibly easy for a criminal to steal items, without difficulty of getting them out of the home (except some furniture); and without leaving visible evidence of the theft, that a neighbor can see from the outside of the home.;
,, By placing valuables in plain-sight; such as having valuables in locations that abut a window, especially on the first floor of the home (i.e. large television or computer system directly behind the large front windows of your home.).
 Be careful of who is knowledgeable of your valuables. By bragging (or telling) about your valuables, even to people you believe are not going to be the burglars; you increase your risk of a home invasion. Even if they are completely innocent, they could possibly tell somebody who is not as upstanding. For those who post information of what they own online, you should also be careful.
 However, in city environments, these can provide additional security to your home. Invest in a quality alarm, preferably with a cellular backup (because it is quite easy for a criminal to disconnect phone wires leading to your home). Be sure to turn it on, especially in the following situations:


You leave your home, and nobody is there. Even if you are only gone for a short period of time.
When you are home alone.
When you are sleeping.
 By removing vegetation that makes it difficult for others to see around your home, you lower the risk that they can make a silent entry.
 If that garage has windows, be sure to put shades or blinds over them; so criminals cannot see what kind of transportation they can steal.
