 Removing the screen and working on a flat surface will be much easier than attempting to work with the screen still in the window.
 Use the claw side of a hammer or pry bar to pull out any staples or nails that hold the screening in place.


Some screens may be held in place with an additional wooden molding strip nailed on top of the screen edges. Pry this up with your hammer or pry bar, being careful not to damage strip so you can replace it when you are done.
 Stretch the new screen over the wooden frame.
 Pull the screen tight with one hand and staple each corner in place, making sure the screen fits tightly across the frame. Continue stapling around the entire frame.
, The molding should cover the rough screen edges.
