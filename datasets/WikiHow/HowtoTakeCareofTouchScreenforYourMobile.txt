 Most of us have the habit of doing this, where we scratch the screen with our nails. Touch screen is made for fingers and therefore one should always make use of them.;
, The touch screen technology is sensitive to fingers and can easily detect the presence of your fingers. There is no need of pressing it heavily.
 Prolonged exposure to the sun-rays causes damage to the phone thereby disturbing a thin layer of liquid gel, which is present in the form of layer over the phone. Hence, the next time you are in your car keep it in such a place where there is no sunlight.
, You may also use a flip cover for screen protection purposes.
