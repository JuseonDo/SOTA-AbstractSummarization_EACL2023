,,, Oxygen is vital to yeast prior to fermentation. Afterwards it can spoil the mead.
 Yeast and nutrients can help, but mead is usually fine "as is". Mead and Wine yeasts work best. Bread yeast may produce slightly off-flavors but will work ok. Making a starter for your yeast isn't necessary, but you can tell easily if the yeast is still good if it's been in storage., Put it in cool place. It will start working within hours. After major foaming stops in a few days add some water and then keep your hands off of it. Leave the mead alone but it is okay to open your cabinet to smell every once in a while., If you wait long enough even the oranges will sink to the bottom. If it is clear it is ready.
 When you get ready to make a different mead you will probably have to unlearn some of these practices. This recipe and procedure works with these ingredients so don't knock it. Sometimes, even the experts can forget all they know and make a good ancient mead.
