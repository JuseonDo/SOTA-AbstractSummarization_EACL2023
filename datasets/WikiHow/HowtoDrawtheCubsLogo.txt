 Try to make them both almost perfect circles, but don't worry if you can't quite get it. Additionally, if you feel you really need help, try tracing something to create this effect.;
, At this point your picture should look like a target, concentric circles going all the way in.
 Do NOT, however, allow them to touch the second ring.
 The blue lines will serve as guides. It should look like a pizza slice.
 Use red for the word "CUBS" and blue for the second ring.
