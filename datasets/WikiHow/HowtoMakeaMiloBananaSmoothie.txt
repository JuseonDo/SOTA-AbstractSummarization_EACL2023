 Using a tablespoon, mix the Milo and milk together until combined.
 Place the lid on the blender and switch on the power., Check every 20 seconds to see if you have the consistency you desire. However, if you wish to have a thicker smoothie, blend for a shorter amount of time., Avoid tall glasses as it will be very difficult to pour in the smoothie with a blender. If you don't have any wider cups, try using a funnel so it will be easier to pour the smoothie in the cup., Add whipped cream and a cherry on top. You could even try placing a straw in the cup to complete it.
