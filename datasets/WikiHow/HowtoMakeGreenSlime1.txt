 This is the most common way of making slime. You can use white or clear school glue. If you are a child, you find an adult to help you. You want to be careful with the borax. Here's what you will need:½ cup clear or white school glue
½ cup cold water
Green food coloring
1 to 5 tablespoons borax
½ cup hot water
2 glass mixing bowls
2 spoons
Plastic jar or sandwich bag;
, If the glue bottle says "4oz" on it, pour the glue into the bowl first.Then, use the bottle to measure out the water. This will help get any extra glue out of the bottle.


If you want clear slime, use clear school glue.
If you want opaque slime, use white school glue. This slime will be pastel colored when you are done.
 The more food coloring you use, the darker your slime will be. Remember, if you are using white school glue, you will end up with a pale green.
 You want to end up with an even color. There should be no streaks, swirls, or globs.
 You will be mixing the borax into this.
 Keep adding borax until it won't dissolve anymore. The more borax you use, the thicker your slime will be. The less borax you use, the thinner your slime will be.


If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.
 You will see a blob form. Keep stirring.
 After your blob forms, you see water at the bottom of the bowl. This water won't mix into the slime anymore. Pour that water out and keep the blob.
 The more you work with the blob, the less sticky and icky it will be. If it is too slimy, let it sit for a few minutes., You can use a plastic jar with a lid. You can also use a zippered sandwich bag. Make sure that no air gets into the bag or jar, or the slime will dry out.
