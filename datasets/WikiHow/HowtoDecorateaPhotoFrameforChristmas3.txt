 If you don't have one, grab a painting frame from the thrift store.
 If it is dirty and dusty, clean off the dust. Sand any part of it that is rough.
 Paint it all one color, either red or green. Allow it to dry completely, then paint another layer or two.
 Tie them together, varying the levels of the baubles. Tie the top end of the cords or string that the baubles hang from over the top center of the frame.
 The bow is most effective if its loops reach across the top bar of the frame. Either glue or tie the bow in place.
 Alternatively, lean the frame against a wall or other surface.
 Either hang, lean or place the frame over a few of the branches of your Christmas tree.
