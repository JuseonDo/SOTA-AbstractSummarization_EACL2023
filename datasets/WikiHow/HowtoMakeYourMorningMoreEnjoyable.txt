@article
  Pack your lunch, set out your outfit, have your parents sign things the night before!  Then you won't have to do that in the morning.;
,  If you have trouble going to sleep, try helping the problem instead of ignoring it.  Wear a sleep mask if you live in a place with a lot of lights (aka a city).  Put in ear plugs if you have fellow household members that stay up late or if you live in a loud place. 


Try to not be on a phone, TV, tablet, computer etc. an hour before bed, screens stimulate your brain, making it harder to fall asleep. 
Don't exercise right before bed.  You might think it will make you tired, but your heart is beating and you are in "get-up and go mode" instead of "fall asleep mode".  Exercise in the morning instead. 
Make sure you go to the bathroom before bed, because if you don't, you might wake up to go to the bathroom, or worse, wet your bed and have to clean it up.
  Put the alarm clock somewhere where you will have to get up to turn it off, or purchase a clock that doesn't have a snooze button or one that has an optional snooze button.
 It is relaxing and eliminates something to do in the morning.
  Things that can be paired with other different items.
  Your day will go a whole lot smoother if you do.
  The less to do, the less time it will take.
  Put on some upbeat, happy music so start off your day!  (You can even buy alarm clocks that are radios or that you can plug your iPod or phone into so you can wake up to music)  Don't put on slow and sad songs, you want music that will get you up and going!

,  You might be surprised.
  It will help you keep on time and make sure that you know if you are behind schedule.
