 Because if you faint it, you might even have to start in the distortion world all over again.;
, Dusk Balls work the best and are probably the way you will catch Giratina if you don't use Ultra Balls. Note that Dusk Balls work only as well as regular Poké Balls when it isn't nighttime.
 Timer Balls work extremely well if you are in battle with Giratina for an extensive period of time. After 20 turns, Timer Balls match Ultra Balls; after 30, they match Dusk Balls at night; after 40, they beat Dusk Balls.
 Have A) a Pokémon that can withstand Dragon and Rock attacks (i.e. Bronzong, Lucario, Steelix) and B) a normal type (i.e. Snorlax, Clefable) to render Giratina's Ghost Type moves--Ominous Wind and Shadow Force--useless.
 In a pinch, paralysis works too, but bear in mind that it is half as effective as sleep and freezing are at facilitating the catch.
