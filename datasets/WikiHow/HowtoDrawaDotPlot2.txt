compared to the dot plot.

@summary
creating the 'one-dot' is very simple, it may require a little bit more work but it's worth it when it comes to saving you time.

@summary
this time you will be labeling the left side of the plot as well as the bottom, opposed to just labeling the bottom.

@summary
just as you would do to the dot plot, you must label the bottom depending on your data that you have.

finished.

 The 'One-Dot' Dot Plot is very similar to the Dot Plot. It's much easier to work with compared to the other. In the following image; You may notice that multiple dots are used. Meanwhile, the One-Dot uses one dot to represent the data.
 This time, instead of drawing one line, a simple rectangular box must be drawn.
 On the left side of the rectangle you drew, you will need to label it with numbers, going up to the highest number you've been given.


For example; If the highest number you have been given is 3, then the side should be numbered: 0, 1, 2, 3 (Going no higher than 3).
 If your data requires numbers then you must label it with numbers, and if words are necessary then those will need to be used instead.
