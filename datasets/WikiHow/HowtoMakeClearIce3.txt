 This should be the warmest setting on your freezer. If you don't want your whole freezer that warm, set it as low as you are willing and place ice tray on the top shelf.
 Leave it to freeze for 24 hours. The slow freeze should force out any gasses and impurities, leaving you with perfectly clear ice cubes.
