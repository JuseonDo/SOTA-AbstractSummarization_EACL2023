, Vary the speed to develop speed and endurance.
 To mimic a real life situation the grip should be pronated (palms facing downward).
 This is a very important exercise as it strengthens your chest muscles and triceps.
 Explosiveness can also be developed some other ways such as plyometrics of the power type (low repetitions).
 The triceps will get worked from the dips, but the pushdowns will give you the mental imagery for the transition from the pull-up to the dip.
 The gymnast, on the rings, uses pure upper body strength.
 Prepare mentally, physically and with having the proper clothing, shoes and equipment.
 Your clothes should be loose and not hamper movement, and your shoes should be flexible and thin soled.
 Climbing down is difficult because you can't see where you are going, among other things. Jumping down from a height is a skill that has some use. Basically, the landing is on the balls of the feet, and the knees and hips bend to absorb the shock. There is balance involved (which is the sixth of the seven senses, the seventh being the temperature sensors). Balance is kept through that inner balance and with the body and arms. In the movie "Rebel Without a Cause", Dean had a few jump downs with excellent form and balance.
