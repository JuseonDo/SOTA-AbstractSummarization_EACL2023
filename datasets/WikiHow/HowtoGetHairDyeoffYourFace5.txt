If you don’t smoke, ask a friend who does if you can collect his or her ashes into a plastic baggie to take home with you.
If you don’t know anyone who smokes, try a local bar if you live in a city that allows smoking in bars, or a coffee shop or restaurant that allows smoking on an outdoor patio.
 This will make a very loose, watery mixture that smells terrible and has a potential to stain carpets, so be very careful with it!

, Use your fingers if you don’t mind the mess, or a cotton ball if you don’t want to touch it.


Let it soak into the stain for about 15 minutes or so.
 Use soap or a face cleanser to make sure your face is completely clear. The stain should come off with the ashes.
