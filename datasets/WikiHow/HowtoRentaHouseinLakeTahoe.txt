 Make a decision on what length of time you plan to visit Lake Tahoe. The length of time you rent a house in Lake Tahoe can determine cost and affect your budget considerably.


The length of stay will also be a factor in which home you choose to rent since certain homes may have limited rental openings. Always find out if there is availability for extra days if you choose to stay longer than planned.
Look for discounts on extended stays. A week-long stay can run cheaper per day than a 3-day stay because the owner of the home will want to rent their house out for as long as possible.;
, Various dates can change the cost of a rental home significantly.


Pick out more than one date if possible so that you can compare costs and will have options if the date you originally chose is more expensive or you can’t find openings on that date.
Keep in mind that the height of tourist season is usually the summer season, but Lake Tahoe can be very busy during the snow season as well due to its skiing opportunities.
Talk to the visitor’s bureau for more details on specific dates that are ideal to visit in Lake Tahoe.
