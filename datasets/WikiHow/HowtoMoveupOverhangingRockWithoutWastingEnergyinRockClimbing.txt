 Before getting on a climb that has overhang, make sure you are already warmed up. Otherwise you can hurt yourself by pulling a muscle.;
, This will avoid your being too tired to make it a good try.
 Also check that your shoes are on tightly enough so they won't come off on certain moves.
, Once you have identified it, figure out how you will move past it. If you have the opportunity, ask other people that have climbed it Â how they did it.
 If it is a boulder you shouldn't be resting because it is best just to power through.
 Only lock off when it is the only way to do the move.
 You want too make sure they don't cut a lot because this is also very energy consuming. Techniques like heel hooking and toe hooking can be very helpful. Make sure your feet aren't too high or low either.
 But remember it doesn't matter if you can't do a climb as long as you have fun and don't get too frustrated. A lot of climbing has to do with the mental aspect, and if you don't think you can do something 90% of the time you won't do it.
