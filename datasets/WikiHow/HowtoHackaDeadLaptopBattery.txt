 There should be 2 catches, slide them to unlocked and slide it out.;
, You may also need some patience and a sharp flathead screwdriver or a butter/putty knife.
 This is the battery controller. Look near the connector to find the board, and trace the wires. Carefully examine every cells by a multimeter to ensure the cells are fully discharged.
 This is important.
 Then take them out of the case.
 Remember to refer back to the note you made in Step 4.
 Solder/weld back the wires and cells.
 Let it rest for about 48 hours.
 Insert your battery and start charging. Turn it on, and you're back in business!
