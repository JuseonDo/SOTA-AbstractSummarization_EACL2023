@summary
get a good camera: virtually any 35mm slr or dslr camera with interchangeable lens will do.

@summary
if possible use the normal (50mm lens).

@summary
set your camera at a low iso--the lower the iso, the better.

@summary
shoot only in the 30-45 minute window after the suns sets or before it rises.

@summary
the only other option is the magical sky that occurs right after a rainstorm when the sky is clean and glowing - cloudy but brightening.

@summary
if you can see shadows the light is bad.

@summary

@summary
put your subject outdoors at least 15 feet (4.6 m) or more in front of a natural backdrop of trees or tall bushes or anything natural.

@summary
get close to your subject - you want their face to fill most of the frame.

@summary
when the light is good and your subject is relaxed, shoot lots of exposures.

@summary
when you develop the film insist on matte or luster finish.

 With the rise of digital cameras these are now VERY affordable. Consider purchasing a used camera and optics.;
, This lens has the best optics (by far) and allows you to shoot in dim light without a flash. DO NOT use a zoom lens - bad optics and they require too much light.
 100 is best but 200 will do. DO NOT set it at 400 or above, as this creates "noise" and grain--unacceptable in fine portraits.
 This is by far the single most important factor in creating a fine portrait without expensive studio lighting. The quality of light during this time is unequaled. NEVER shoot portraits in full sun.
,, Do not put your subject closer than 15 feet (4.6 m) to anything - you want a blurred background with no distractions.
 Most people stand back way too far from their subject.
 The first 3 or 4 shots the model will be nervous (you are probably closer to them than they are used to) - Try keep them relaxed and smiling. Ask them to look slightly away from the camera - they should be looking at your shoulders or just a foot or two to your side. For a great portrait take several images with the same pose.
 DO NOT get glossy - portraits always look better in matte finish.
