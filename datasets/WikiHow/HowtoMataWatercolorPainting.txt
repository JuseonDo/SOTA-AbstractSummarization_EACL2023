 This will protect the paper itself.


Use an acid-free sealant spray formulated for use with water colors, and be aware that some of the older sprays tend to yellow your paints somewhat.;
, You can find several varieties of backing board at most arts and crafts supply stores. Many are acid free and self adhesive.

Use mulberry hinges and wheat paste for the mounting. The hinges should be slightly lighter than the paper. In case of a problem it is better for the hinge to tear and not the painting.






Attach the hinges only at the top of the watercolor paper to the backing, using only acid free material such as Foam Core. These hinges can be removed with water in the future if necessary. When framing and matting one does not want to do any harm and it should all be reversible.

Always use museum glass or UV protective glazing, also available in acrylic glazing.
