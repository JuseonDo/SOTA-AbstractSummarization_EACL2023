 so that's how it looks on the front. then sew it onto the location of the jacket.
 the pocket is located on the right side of the jacket. Also, make another small piece to be the cover of the pocket.
, Its located on the left side of the jacket with 2 zippers. sew both zippers on a piece of leather, and it is ready to be attached on the left side of the jacket. Cut 2 pieces of zippers, one long and one short. use the pins to attach the zipper on to the long space. do the same with the short part also.
, after cutting 2 black and 2 grey pieces. line up 2 blacks and 2 greys to look like a hoodie. its like a smile where you can see someone teeth.
,, the left straps are its completion. Make two of relatively short white straps to insert under the end of the hoodie. insert under this part on both sides. it's better to hand sew them on the jacket instead of on the backside of hoodie. after sewing both... the jacket is truly DONE!

,, and decide the length of the straps for 1) one on the pocket of the jacket and 2) on the shorts

,, it is time to attach everything on. first start with the Zippers. The zippers will be sewed on from the bottom all the way to the neck

, Remember to sew it up to the neck. Then do the same for the zipper on the other side. When the attachment is done. the jacket will truly, finally exist.
