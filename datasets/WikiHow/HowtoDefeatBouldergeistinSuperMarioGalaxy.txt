 Ghosty Galaxy (Super Mario Galaxy) OR Boss Blitz Galaxy (Super Mario Galaxy 2);
, Bouldergeist will summon several rocks toward you. Avoid them. Don't stand still or else his rocks will destroy you.
 The black rocks he summoned will turned into black ghosts. Shake the Wii remote when near one to grab hold of its tongue. Swing the ghost towards Bouldergeist.
 Continue to repeat step 3.
 These hands will be used to try to crush you. Avoid them the best you can.


When he summons hands, there are two methods. One is destroy both hands before attacking as to ensure safety. Two is try to attack when the hands are in a helpful position, which is faster but riskier.
 Watch for the spiked rocks that he summons out of the ground. Hit a spiky part, and start over.
 This is not a race, and if you ever question whether you can survive a certain move, don't do it.
