 Contact your local homeowner's association and find out what you need to do for permission to build. The expenses of the project will cost you at least several tens of thousands of dollars to complete, if not more, depending on how accurate you want your replica to be.;
, Obviously it should be oval-shaped but not too round or large. The approximate dimensions can be found here. If you have the time and expertise, you can do the construction yourself to save money.
, There are two "cutaway" doors hidden into the back wall between the fireplace, one large glass door that leads out to the Rose Garden patio (outdoors), and a large wooden door at the front right of the room. You really only need one door to access your replica, so just build the hidden doors or large wooden door for show.
 Make sure it is properly ventilated.
 They should contain only three shelves and have a designed alcove above them.
, While the exact paint color of the Oval Office is probably difficult to accurately find, there are some types that look very similar. Print out some photos of the Oval Office, visit your local paint or hardware store and ask a staff member for help.
, Begin by contacting Rode Bros. Fine Wood Flooring Company, the ones that installed the hardwood floor in the actual Oval Office. Ask if they can install the same type of flooring for your replica.
 Have it designed with any colors you'd like, but the presidential seal must be in the center.
 These include reproductions of presidential portraits, lamps, books, side chairs, coffee tables, sofas, and of course, the Resolute desk. Most of them can be found here.
 Make sure it matches the color scheme of the room.
 Enjoy your Oval Office replica!
