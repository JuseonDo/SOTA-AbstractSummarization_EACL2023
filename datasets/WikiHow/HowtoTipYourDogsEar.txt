get your equipment ready and within reaching distance.

@summary
place your dog on the surface area that you will be using.

@summary
brush out the ear that you would like to start on.

@summary
test the ear with your comb.

@summary
hold your dog's ear with your thumb over the top of the ear and your other fingers under it, forcing the ear to lay flat against them.

@summary
with your good hand, hold your clippers like a pencil and turn them on.

@summary
bring your clipper down to the halfway point and gently run your clipper over the dogs ear at a constant rate and repeat till no more hair falls off (doing this too slowly or too quickly can catch the skin and cut the ear).

@summary
flip the ear over so that the inside of the ear is facing you.

@summary
now angle your clippers at a 45 degree against the ear and gently go down the ear again; repeat this process as necessary.

@summary
repeat the above step but now rotate your clippers the other way by 90 degrees, removing the bulk of hair from the other side.

@summary
repeat steps 3-10 on the adjacent ear.

now your dog has tipped ears.

 Never put your things anywhere that the dog may kick, your tools are expensive and may be damaged if they fall.;
, Having someone else there to hold your pet secure may come in handy in this part of the segment.
 Using your slicker brush, gently brush the dogs ear from the base of the flap (where the ear meets the head on top) to the edge of the flap. You do not need to dig into the ear, but you should be able to feel the bristles run along the skin. Do not over brush your dogs ear as ears are fragile and may bleed with little provocation.
 Your comb is not to rip mats out if your dog's ear is matted, but merely to check to see if there are any tangles at all. like the brush, run your comb from the base of the ear, to the outer edge of the ear.
 Find the halfway point of the ear and make a mental not of where this is.
 If your dog is unfamiliar with this sound, let them see the clipper for a moment and introduce them by letting them sniff the butt end of the clipper (blades are sharp enough to cut a dogs tongue if they try to lick it).
 Don't worry if this doesn't' remove all of the hair, that's what the next step is for.
 You should be able to see a distinct line from where you shaved the top. Start at this line and travel down the ear to the tip. Never go backwards on an ear; you WILL cut it.
 This should remove the bulk of the hair that wasn't removed in the previous steps.
 The ears should be tipped and even.
, Enjoy!
