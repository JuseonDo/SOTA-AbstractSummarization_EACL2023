 Scout even earlier it is a large map.
 If the Zerg is doing a 6-pool, your rush has a high chance of failing, as you won't be able to hold off early Zerglings. If he's going for a 9-pool, you're relatively safe. If your Pylon and Probe are attacked my a handful of Drones, pull back and stop the rush. Prepare for a longer game. The point of building at the choke is to prevent the Zerg from expanding.
 Make sure to keep pumping Probes and making Pylons back at your main.
, You most likely won't have enough minerals for two after building a Forge and Cannons.
, try to pick off a handful of Drones. The Zerg will most likely take the Drones off the minerals to keep them alive. Keep them off the minerals as long as possible. As stated before, do anything to set back your opponent's economy.
 Watch out for Mutalisks, as the Zerg will most likely go air to escape your blockade. Tech to Corsairs and kill Overlords to keep the Zerg from massing.
 You will be behind in macro and economy, a severe disadvantage.
