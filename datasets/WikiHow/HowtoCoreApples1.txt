;
, You should insert it about one centimeter from the center of the apple to avoid inserting it directly into the core.
 Do it slowly, so you don't cut yourself. Make sure that the knife pokes through the bottom of the apple, so you can see the blade.
 Do this slowly and carefully. Watch where you place your fingers. If the knife does slide out more quickly than you expect, the blade should not go anywhere near your fingers or palm.
 When you're finished, you should have made four incisions to create a square around the center of the apple.
 Drag it from the first incision to the second, and all the way through the other two incisions, until you have completely cut around the apple's core.
 Push it down through the apple until it pops out.
