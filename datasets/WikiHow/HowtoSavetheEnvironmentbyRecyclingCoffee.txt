@summary
before you start, first of all collect used coffee grouts from your coffee (tea sachets can also be used, but they might be a little less effective).

@summary
then dry the grouts thoroughly.

@summary
once the grouts are dried, they are now ready to be used.

@summary
if you want your hands to be super-clean, snip the bag open and simply place the grouts into your liquid hand wash.

@summary
to give wooden furniture a nice, polished touch, simply dampen the bottom of an uncut bag with only a small amount of lime-water mix.

@summary
before tying the cloth together, place 4-5 sticks of cinnamon on top the coffee grouts.

@summary
keep one or two bags at the base of any snail-laden plant, and some loose grouts planted at the same base.

 If you like, you can collect some grouts from cafes' by the end of the day. Most of them might gladly give the grouts away for absolutely F.O.C.;
, You can do this by using two methods; you can either spread them on a dish and dry them for two to three days under the sun, or heat em' in the microwave for 10-15 minutes. Whichever way you choose, make sure they're dried all the way through, otherwise they'll be infested by fungus.
 Tie approximately one tablespoon of the grouts on a square piece of muslin cloth to make a small bag. Snip the bag open whenever you're about to use them, unless specified otherwise.
 They are known to prevent certain types of bacteria from getting onto your hands, keeping you free from pesky germs.
 Then rub the furniture with the bag. Squeeze dirty water out if necessary.
 After tying the bag, pierce some holes onto it using a fork. Then hang the bag up anywhere you like. Not only does it release an earthy aroma, but this is also a natural lizard repellent!

, While keeping those critters away from damaging your plant(s), they also provide excellent fertilizer!
