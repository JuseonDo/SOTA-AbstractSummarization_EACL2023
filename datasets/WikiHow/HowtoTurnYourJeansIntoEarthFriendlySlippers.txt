 Slip your feet into the pockets to check if they'll fit.;
,, Cut out the traced foot templates.
 Make sure the material is long enough for your foot, and a seam allowance.


Cut off the jean leg ends just above each slipper's seam allowance once you're satisfied with the length and width.
 Using tailor's chalk, trace around each of the cardboard foot templates onto each of the cut-off ends.


Use straight pins to firmly hold together the two layers of denim.
Once pinned in place, cut out the foot shapes in the denim fabric. Be sure to leave adequate seam allowance around the edges.
 These are now your "denim slipper bases".



Cut out each foam foot insert and set aside.



Slip the cardboard foot template inside each denim slipper base, followed by the foam foot insert on top of the cardboard insert.






Do this for both denim slipper bases, and then sew the seam closed.
 Cut as close as you can without cutting the pocket material. The pocket needs to come away completely intact, with both its front and backing sides in place (i.e., still serving as a real pocket).
 Align them squarely and neatly.



Denim, no matter how old it is, can be difficult to sew through, although jeans using TencelÂ® fabric might be softer. Do what you can to make the sewing easier on your fingers (use a thimble!). If you have a sturdy sewing machine, try using that but be careful not to sew the front of the pocket down.
 These make great gifts for birthdays and best friends.
