Try a pink tiara! Spark your creativity on this one. You can even name your boat and put its name on the sail. Fun fact: most boat's names are female., Careful not to make the mast tilt!, If it works, done! If not, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tin foil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges.
