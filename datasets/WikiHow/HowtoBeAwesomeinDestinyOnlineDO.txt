 Start off the game by completing the first level on Earth. Play through the early missions on the first two planets. This way, you'll level up quick.
 Do various tasks there such as upgrading your character/equipment, picking up bounties, bartering, and socializing with other Guardians.
 Try starting a hut with some of your friends, or players that you get along with.
 Find out what works for you, and keep at it until you have mastered them.
 Put your skills to the test in versus modes. Try out different game modes to raise your level, get more points, unlock new equipment, and improve your playing ability.
 Get rid of materials you no longer want or require. Upgrade your inventory as you progress. Make sure you carry powerful weapons in your arsenal at all times. Make sure to carry sufficient ammunition for them as well.
 After a while your skill should be honed, and your pockets lined with money. Purchase any unlocked goods that can increase your chances of winning.
