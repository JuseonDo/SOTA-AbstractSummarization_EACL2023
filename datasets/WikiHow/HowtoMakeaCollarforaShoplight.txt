 You can find it at most stores that sell arts and crafts and you can also find it at many dollar stores.
 Two inches is a good width to start with. Here, the selected width is the width of the level. Another good choice of a width would be the width of your duct tape.
 If you have something that is a little more (or less), like a deck of cards, use it., Do not cut through it. That is why a scrolling tool that will serrate the foamcore is a better tool.

You will probably need to have two lengths of foamcore to have enough to go around the circumference of a 10 inch (25.4Â cm) shoplight.
,, Use scissors or a sharp edge to trip it to the correct length.
