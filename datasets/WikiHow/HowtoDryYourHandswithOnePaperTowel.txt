 Turn the water off while you soap up, and make sure the water is completely off when you are through.
 Shake excess water into the sink. Joe Smith suggests shaking 12 times, but if you don't want to count, just shake several times, until most of the excess water is removed., If you're in the habit of grabbing a whole handful, you may need to be mindful about taking just one.

Some dispensers crank out towels by the roll. In this case, simply dispense a more modest-sized piece. Aim for about 12 inches (30cm) or less.
For motion-activated dispensers, you can often get a smaller chunk of towel by tearing as the machine begins to dispense.
Most folded or stacked towels dispense individually. In this case, all you have to do is take only one.
 The little bit of added bulk improves absorbency.,,
