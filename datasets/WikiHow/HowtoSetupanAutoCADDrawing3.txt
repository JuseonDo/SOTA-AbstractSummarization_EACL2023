 Before scaling, you should make sure that all layers are set to ON and UNLOCKED.

 This is going to be your reference length.
Command: Scale --> select entire drawing, except your reference line, press space.



Type "re" (as reference), press space.
Pick first point and endpoint of the object from your drawing, that you want it to be 100 units long.
Type "po" (as points), press space.
