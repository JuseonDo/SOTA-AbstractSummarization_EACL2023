 (If you don't know how, make a horizontal swipe with the Wii remote.) Do you notice the chihuahua?

, You never know what she'll do. She sometimes gets mad when the axe is thrown. She sometimes asks for the player's opinion of her looks, or ask if she looks different. She'll be happy if you answer yes.
 If you answer yes, you hate her, she might keep the axe or give you a golden axe so you'll like her.
 She will keep the axe, give it back, give you a golden axe or give you a silver one. You never know.
 Serena will probably give the axe back if you say a normal one.
