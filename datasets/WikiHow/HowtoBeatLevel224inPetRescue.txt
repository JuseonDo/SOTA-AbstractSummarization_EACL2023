 The larger the clusters cleared, the faster youâ€™ll earn Column Blaster boosters. This also helps generate extra points.


Try to generate at least seven Column Blaster boosters. This is the total amount of boosters needed to clear blocks and pass level 224.;
, This clears diamonds and meshed blocks from the column, and stacks the pet cages on top of one another.
 All pet cages will link together after clearing these three blocks, with the exception of the cage in the far left column., This frees and rescues the first pet from its cage.
 All eight pets will now be rescued.
