 Driving a forklift is nothing like driving a car. Forklifts are steered by their rear wheels, have unwieldy weight distribution, and often have counter-intuitive controls. Depending on where you operate, you may need a license or specialized training.;
, Look around the vehicle for any damage or malfunction that might prevent the forklift from operating as it is intended. Pay special attention to hydraulic mechanisms and tire conditions. This is very important!

, This can be done by reading the operator’s manual.
,,,, Move it through basic operations. There will be knobs and levers that move the forks up and down, steer the vehicle and control the speed.
 Try lifting empty pallets or bags of sand to get used to the controls. Once you are comfortable, you can begin your intended chore.
