divide your hair into sections.

roll one section up and tie with one piece of paper towel.

 The larger the section, the larger the curl; the smaller the section, the tighter the curl.
 Repeat for each section you want to turn into curls.
 The softness of the towels makes for easier sleeping on the curls, and the paper won't tear your hair.
 You'll be left with wonderful hair curls.
