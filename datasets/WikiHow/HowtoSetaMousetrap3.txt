 If you're ok with repeatedly handling and reusing a trap with dead mouse on it, high quality reusable options are available. These are reliable, but involve a little more face-to-face time with the mouse.


Cheap wooden disposable snap traps often come in packages of three or five and are an economical bet if you've got a serious mouse problem.
 Remember: the more traps you use in the targeted rodent zones, the more effective the traps will be at getting rid of the mice.
 Baiting the trap first is important, because you'll want to fiddle with it as little as possible after setting it.
, Use a firm grip so the trap doesn't snap your finger.
 Keep holding the snapper firmly until you've got it set.
 This will hold the snapper in place, but it's very sensitive. Use caution.
