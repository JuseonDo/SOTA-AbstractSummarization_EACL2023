 A good selection or "bases" are water, milk, soy milk, skim milk, flavored water additives (such as crystal lite) or fruit juice.;
, Typically you'll have Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry. Add a fruit or two to the mix for more flavor and a boost of vitamins and antioxidants. Bananas, Mixed Berries, Mango, Strawberries and blueberries will work well. Add any supplements you feel you may need such as Vitamin C, Glutamine and Creatine.
, Then kick back and enjoy.
