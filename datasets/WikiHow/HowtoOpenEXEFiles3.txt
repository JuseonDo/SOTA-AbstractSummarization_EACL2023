 7-Zip is a free, open-source archive program that can open EXE files as if they were an archive like a ZIP or RAR file. This will work with many EXE files, but not every one.


You can download 7-Zip from 7-zip.org.
 This will open the EXE file in the 7-Zip archive explorer. If you don't have the 7-Zip options when you right-click on a file, open 7-Zip from the Start menu and then browse for the EXE file that you want to open.


7-Zip cannot open all EXE files. You may get an error when attempting to open certain EXE files. You can try using a different archive program, such as WinRAR, but chances are you won't be able to open the file due to the way it was originally compiled.
 When you open the EXE file in 7-Zip, you'll be shown a list of files and folders that the EXE file contains. You can double-click folders to see the files stored inside. You can select multiple files by holding Ctrl and clicking each one.
 You'll be prompted to select a location, which will default to the same location as the EXE file.
