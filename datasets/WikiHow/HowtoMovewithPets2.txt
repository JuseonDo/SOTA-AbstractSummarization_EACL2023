 Routines are very important, especially when so much else around them is changing. Feed and/or walk your pet at the same time that you would normally.
 If you don't have anywhere to leave your pet or are traveling alone, keep your pet on a leash or in a carrier at first. Inspect your new home for anything that might be harmful, such as wet paint, sawdust, broken glass or bare wires.
 Make sure that all doors and windows are closed for the time being. Allow your pet to get used to your new dwellings.
, Give them time to associate their new home as a positive place.
 If your pet is microchipped, make sure that information is changed as well. Since you are in a new place, it will be easier for your pet to get lost as they are in a new environment.
 Your pet may be confused with the new surroundings. Have patience and understand this is a confusing time.
 Gradually allow them to spend more time outside.
