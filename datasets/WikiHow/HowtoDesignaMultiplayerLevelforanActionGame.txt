 For team games, you don't want one side to overpower the other.;
, You want to have differences between the two sides. For example, if you give one side a big wall of cover, give the other side a hill. This is balanced but not symmetrical.
,, If you have a spot with a powerful turret, make sure it can be shot at, because you don't want there to be a single, overpowering player.
