,, You will be disconnected from the internet when you change settings.,,, Entering Netflix's US DNS server will make Netflix think you are connecting from the US. The Netflix DNS servers change regularly, so there's a good chance that the codes listed on this page will be outdated. To find the latest servers, perform a Google search for "US Netflix DNS addresses".

As of November 24th, 2014, 108.061.173.107 / 108.061.173.108 and 213.005.182.117 / 23.021.182.024 are working DNS Primary / Secondary combinations.
 You will need to restart your system for the DNS changes to take effect., If you haven't logged in before, log in with your Canadian account. You will see the American selection of streaming video.

If you aren't able to access Netflix, try a different set of DNS addresses.
If you continue to have trouble finding working DNS addresses, consider a paid VPN service such as Unblock-US.
