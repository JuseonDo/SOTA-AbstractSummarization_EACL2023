 Most clothes are not dirty after being worn for just a few hours. A sweater worn over a t-shirt is not dirty unless it gets spilt on. Pants can usually be worn a few times before needing to be washed. Exceptions such as underclothes, socks, and most kids clothing (they don't stay clean) should be washed after every wearing.;
, Most of the energy and cost of a washer is in the hot water. Clothes will clean just as well in cold water as they will in hot, and they will not shrink.
 Most laundry caps have several different lines that mark how much detergent to use based on load size. Make sure you are only filling the cup to the correct line, or even a little bit below the line.
, Dilute a bit of detergent in water and apply to your stains. Diluted dish soap will also work just as well.
 A half cup of vinegar will work as a fabric softener.
 They will still work just as well, or use the same dryer sheet for two loads.
 The point of the dryer ball is to fluff your clothes to help them dry faster.
 When the weather is nice, use a clothes line, and during poor weather and winter, use laundry racks.
