 Your video card drivers may be causing problems when Windows loads. Removing them will allow you to boot normally and then install the latest working drivers.
 This will open the Advanced Boot Options menu if you are quick. If Windows tries to load, you'll need to reboot and try again.
 This will load Windows in Safe Mode, which will usually work even if Windows normally shows a black screen.


If Safe Mode will not work, try a Startup Repair.
,,, You may have one or more display adapters listed here.
,,, If the video drivers were causing the problem, Windows should now boot normally, though at a lower resolution than you may normally use.
 If removing the old display drivers fixed your problem, you'll want to install the latest available drivers to get your display capabilities back:


Open your web browser.
Visit the driver download page for your graphics adapter. You're likely using either Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA. If you aren't sure, just try the auto-detection software for each one.
Run the autodetection tool on the driver site to scan your computer and retrieve the proper files.
