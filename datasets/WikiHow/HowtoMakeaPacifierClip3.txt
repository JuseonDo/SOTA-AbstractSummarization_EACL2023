 This step will also assist with proper alignment of both pieces.
 The wrong side of fabric will be facing you. Pin the 2 pieces of fabric in place.
 Be sure to leave both ends open at this point.
 Attach the safety pin to one section of the fabric at an open end. Push the safety pin into the open end and thread it through the inside of your fabric until it emerges out the opposite open end.
 Straighten and adjust your fabric until it lays flat. With seams facing along each side of your fabric, iron the fabric to lay completely flat and crisp.
, One safety pin will be pushed through the sleeve and 1 will prevent the elastic from slipping all the way into the sleeve.
 Continue threading until your safety pin emerges out the opposite open end. Pull the safety pin all the way through to prevent it from slipping back into the sleeve.
 Be sure to pin through the elastic to prevent it from moving into the sleeve once you remove the safety pins.
 Use a straight pin to keep the 3 layers in place.
, Keep close to the edges. Not only will this strengthen the piece, it will keep it neat and prevent it from rolling in on itself.
 Fold over approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric and secure both pieces of fabric together with a straight pin. Hand-stitch the clip in place to prevent it from slipping while trying to sew fabric together. Remove the pin and use the sewing machine to complete the stitches.
, Stitch the remaining piece of Velcro 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the first piece. This is where you will loop the pacifier into the strap. Make sure to position the Velcro so that the pieces will stick when they are placed together.
 You will hand stitch this to the side that holds the clip. Position it so that it will cover as much of the exposed clip as possible. Be sure to secure the patch with enough stitches to prevent it from coming loose.
