, There should be a button that says upload once you have logged into your account. Choose pictures that you want to upload to make your calendar. If you want, you can choose pictures from an event or trip, or just any pictures you like. You can choose multiple pictures because most calendars can have multiple pictures on one page.
 Click "Calendar" and it will direct you to a page with different types of calendars. They all have different styles, but choose the one you want to make.
 There are different designs available. Some are for holidays, while others are solid colors or patterns. Choose one that you like, or would go well with the pictures. For example, if you are making a calendar with lots of summer photos, do not choose a background with Christmas designs.
 Remember that larger calendars will be more expensive than small ones. When you are done, click "create"

 Use the tabs at the bottom of the page to switch between layouts and backgrounds. Play around with different styles.
