 Chill glasses in the freezer for about 15 minutes, or until slightly frosty. This will keep your milkshake from melting too quickly.


You can make one giant milkshake, or divide it among several smaller glasses.
 Peel 2 bananas and cut them into 1 inch chunks. Place the chunks on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze, until hard. This will probably take about an hour.


You could also freeze the bananas whole. They'll just take longer to freeze, at least several hours., Blend the frozen bananas with the milk until the mixture becomes creamy and smooth. This will take several minutes, especially if using whole frozen bananas.
 Blend this mixture until the Oreos are chopped to your desired texture.


The longer you blend, the smoother and finer the Oreo milkshake will become. If you want larger chunks of cookies, simply pulse the Oreos and whipped cream a few times.
 Serve immediately.
