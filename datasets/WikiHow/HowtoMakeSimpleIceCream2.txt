 Pour the heavy cream into a mixer, and beat on high. This will give you a thick, creamy base for your ice cream.If you don't have an electric mixer, you can use a food processor fitted with whisks.
 Make sure that the bowl is large enough to hold the beaten heavy cream as well.
 Keep folding and stirring until it is evenly combined., Gently fold in your desired additions or flavorings with a spatula. Be careful not to over-mix, or your ice cream will lose its fluffiness. Here are some ideas to get you started:To make mint-chip ice cream, add a few drops of peppermint extract and a handful of mini chocolate chips.
To make S'mores ice cream, add some mini marshmallows, crumbled graham crackers, and some chocolate chunks.
