@summary
start running at a pace that'll give you enough momentum to leap the distance, but don't go so fast that you take off with excessive force.

@summary
take off by jumping up more than across.

@summary
use your body to "swim" across the air if you feel so inclined.

@summary
kick your leg(s) forward as you near the wall to help reduce the force with which you'll hit the wall ahead.

,

@summary
grab the ledge at the same time your leg meets the wall.

@summary
brace yourself for the collision.

@summary

, You want to go high enough that if you miss the wall, you fall straight down rather than hit the wall with the front of your body.
 In this photograph, a double kick is used, which would be inconvenient in smaller spaces. How you choose to move your body during the leap is a matter of personal preference.
, If the wall you are cat leaping to has very little difference in height to the platform you took off of, it is sometimes better to land with your legs first, close to the top of the wall. Then delay the grab by a split second, allowing your body to drop a little down the wall.
 When the momentum follows your grab, let your body hang low and swing to absorb some of the shock. Make sure that the first leg to hit the wall is outside of your body, not folded against your chest, or else you'll hurt your knee badly.
