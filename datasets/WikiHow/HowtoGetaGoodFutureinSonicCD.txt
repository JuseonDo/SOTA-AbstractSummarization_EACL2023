 It doesn't matter which round, but it must be the first zone from it in order to get a Good Future.
 A "Past" sign will be also added to the life counter., Running fast enough until your character sparkles and jumping will result in a successful time-travel., Those become trickier to find in later rounds., Advance into the next zone and you will have a Good Future.
