 A business plan details how your business will run. While this step is not required to operate a sole proprietorship, it will help you to plan your business.;
, If you wish to conduct business under a name that is not your own, you must obtain a certificate to do so. You may file for a DBA at your local county clerk’s office building by filling out a form and paying a fee. If you are doing business under your given name (not giving your business a separate name) you do not need a DBA.
 As a sole proprietor, your business does not technically exist from a legal standpoint, and therefore you need not file any paperwork to get it started.
