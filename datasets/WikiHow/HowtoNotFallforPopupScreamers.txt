 It could be a screamer. Don't take your chances- you can always hit 'replay' if after watching it nothing occurs.;

 If the video seems like a good one, play it safe and keep the volume down. You don't want to scare the household (or yourself) half to death with loud screams if it is in fact a screamer.
 You'll be able to tell if it's a screamer if an ugly face pops up. This goes for YouTube, too. Don't fall for any of these videos: Toy Story Secrets, Relaxing Car Drive, Scary Car Ad, Scary Golf Shots. They are indeed scary, and aren't very relaxing.
