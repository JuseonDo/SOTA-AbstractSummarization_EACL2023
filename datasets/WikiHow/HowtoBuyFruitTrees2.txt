, The fruit trees that establish quickest generally have trunks with diameters ranging from 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to 5/8 inch (1.6 cm).
 Trees with crooked trunks are more likely to topple when burdened with fruit or during windy weather.
 These make it difficult to walk beneath the trees at harvest time. Low branches also make lawn maintenance difficult and offer easy perches for animals that will eat the fruit., There should be clearly defined leader branches growing in the middle.
 Choose fruit trees with abundant roots that appear healthy and free of injuries.
