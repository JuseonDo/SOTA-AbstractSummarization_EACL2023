@summary
purchase a wood lathe.

@summary
set up the lathe in a space with good lighting in an area that makes for easy cleanup for the wood chips and dust.

@summary
sketch out the shape you want to achieve on a sheet of paper, keeping the design within the limits of the wood blank and capacity of the lathe.

@summary
begin turning by finding the center of the wood stock on each end.

@summary
slide the tailstock center spur up to the center of the other end of the wood, locking it down.

@summary
,

@summary
turn the handle on the tailstock center, driving the wood blank into the spurn of the headstock securing it between the centers.

@summary

@summary
set the tool rest to an approximate center of the work piece and as close as possible without it hitting the work piece when it is turning.

@summary

@summary
start the lathe on slow speed and use a gouge to rough out or round off the piece to the basic shape you need.

@summary

@summary
position the large gouge, tip turned up, onto the tool rest with the end of the handle against your hip.

@summary
use the parting tool with a pair of outside calipers to set the depth of cuts you will need.

@summary
set the skewed chisel at an angle onto the tool rest.

@summary
sand the piece while it is still mounted and turning at a slow speed.

@summary
cut the end of the work that is attached to the headstock and tailstock loose with the parting tool.

 You will also need accompanying turning tools.


Lathes and basic turning tools are found in woodworker supply stores. The basic tools include a parting tool, gouge, skewed chisel and scraper.;
,,,


Draw a line from one corner to opposite corner on square or rectangular stock. The point where the lines intersect will be the center.
On round stock, use a self-centering tool and follow manufacturer's instructions.
Mount the wood by centering it onto the headstock of the lathe spur.
,,,,


Slowly lower the tip until it engages the wood and begins to chatter.
Work the gouge back and forth along the wood surface and against the tool rest until the chattering stops and the stock is round.
Increase the speed of the lathe and use the small gouge to finish roughing out the shape.



Hold the narrow end of the tip against the tool rest and push it straight into the work piece. Check the calipers frequently until you achieve the depth you need.



Refine the shape you want by moving the chisel back and forth over the tool rest and surface of the wood blank.
Trial and error will help to determine the most efficient angle needed to hold the skewed end of the chisel to the face of the work.
Employ the rounded flat end of the scraper chisel, supported against the tool rest, to run over the surface, smoothing out any tool marks.
 Begin with 180 grit and finish with 440 grit sandpaper.
 This will sever it from the finish piece while the work is still slowly turning.


Continue supporting the back side of the piece with your gloved hand. The work piece will fall off into your hand.
You can remove the piece from the other end by cutting it off with a fine-toothed hand saw. Set the tool rest to an approximate center of the work piece, and as close as possible, without it hitting the work piece when it is turning.
