 Arrange the loop around both of your feet at the ankles. Leave some space between your two feet. This loop will be used to lever you up and down the betel tree.
,, You will notice that your feet can grab the tree firmly with the cloth loop in place, allowing you to stand still without even needing to grab with your hands.
 Use your hands to grab to the next higher position you'd like to aim for. Pull yourself up by releasing your feet from the former holding position, then let your feet grab the next higher position., When you reach the fruits, pick them with one hand while using the other hand to hold onto the tree for safety. Keep your feet firmly grabbing onto the tree trunk.
 Then reverse the climbing process to allow you to climb back down the tree. Release your feet off the tree trunk, and step by step, move down as your hands continue to grab at the tree trunk.

A more experienced climber can climb down even faster by loosening the feet-grab and sliding slowly down the tree. Don't try this until you're confident that you can climb the tree really well.
