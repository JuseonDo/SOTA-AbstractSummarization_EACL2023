 You can tell this if he or she is able to dribble (kicking ball close to your feet) and can shoot with accuracy.;
, Ask them if they would enjoy playing soccer or anything related to that.
(Watch soccer with them, play soccer with them.) Sometimes joining (or starting) a soccer league of your own will help your child enjoy the game more.
 If they don't, you shouldn't force them to play.
 In some areas there are both spring and fall leagues, but because fall is the soccer season, it is usually more competitive and has better coaching than the spring leagues.
 However, remind them that it is everything and it is not all about winning. As long as they do their best and have fun, you will always be proud of them.
 Your child will understand that he can play with you more often, or play by him/herself when you are not around. It is inexpensive and takes only 3-4 hours to get trained to coach in a youth soccer league.
