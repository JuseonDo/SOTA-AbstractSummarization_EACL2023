 Were there role models in your own young life who kept you on track and helped you to succeed?;
, This should help you get an idea about how you should help this student.
, There are many of these out there. Try looking at after school programs that some schools and county governments provide. If you already know of a student that you think needs help, skip to step 6.
 You don't want to be stopped just because you forgot something.
 Remember this student may be at risk, and needs help. Remember to help them along to being a good student. Also remember to be friendly, you want them to enjoy, not dread your company.
 Often times, this is all that is needed to change their outlook and begin unlocking potential. Counseling intervention may not be needed, and you've made the difference.
 Just your presence and continued attention will help, and you'll set an example of dedication and punctuality.
 Even if you get together to attend a ball game or go have some ice cream, you can be a positive influence.
