 There is no need to secure with a band.
 (Assuming you're right-handed but if you're left-handed, just swap the lefts for the rights and the rights for the lefts.)

 Then poke it down and through the collected hair. This is a tricky bit, so go slowly and be prepared to keep trying until you get the hang of it.
