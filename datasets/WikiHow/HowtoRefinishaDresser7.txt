, For drawers, only the outer portion on show needs painting. Allow all to dry; this is now the undercoat layer.
 Don't press too hard or you'll sand through to the wood. Wipe the dust off with a soft, clean rag.


If you do sand too deeply, repaint the undercoat on that spot before painting the next layer.
 This becomes the top coat. Allow to dry.


Paint with long brush strokes and light pressure. Only use the tip of the paintbrush bristles.
 Again, do not press too hard or you'll need to reapply the paint if you reach the undercoat or wood.
 Use the same long, gentle strokes from the tip of the paintbrush to get a perfect finish. Let dry.
 The refinish will be glossy, shiny and durable.
