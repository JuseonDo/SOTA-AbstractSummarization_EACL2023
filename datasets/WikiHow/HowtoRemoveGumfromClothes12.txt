 Less surface area on the gum means less gum to remove.
 Lanacane is available at drug stores or grocery stores.


Lanacane contains Ethanol, Isobutane, Glycol, and Acetate. This group of chemicals speeds up the release of the gum.
 A knife with a good edge might work better, but it has a higher chance of cutting through your fabric.
