 Set your front foot so ¾ of it is on the skateboard but so that your toes are hanging over a bit.;
, Before you get to your maximum Ollie height, kick your front foot up and out and try to spin the board using your heel, not toe, rolling your ankle.
 Stay above the board. watch for the kick tape to come round. Remember to keep the board from getting caught with your feet.
, Try to land ideally,(which is on the bolts). Doing this will provide a safer, smoother landing, and prevent your board from snapping. Remember to roll smoothly!
