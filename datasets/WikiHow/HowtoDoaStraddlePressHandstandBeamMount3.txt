Make sure your legs are high.
Lean slightly forward, but not in front of your hands.
Keep your body balanced at the center of your hands.
 Do this by quickly switching your hands, from facing the side of the beam, to the cross side of the beam (forwards).



Don't over-hold; doing so could create a wrist injury!
If you are doing a lot of difficult skills that consistently hurt your wrists, get wrist supports, such as tiger paws.
 Once you have perfected this mount, you could add the press handstand part.
 Be confident and always use a spotter when learning it.
