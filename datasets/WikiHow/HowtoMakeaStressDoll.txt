@summary
draw an outline of a doll on a sheet of paper with a sharp pencil and cut it out.

@summary
use the pattern to cut out 2 dolls from your fabric.

@summary
pin the right sides of the 2 doll fabric pieces together with sewing pins.

@summary
sew the 2 doll fabric pieces together, using a thread that matches the fabric.

@summary
reach inside the open side of the fabric dolls and stuff the doll with your fabric stuffing.. like the shape and colour, the stuffing can also make your stress doll better to use - if you're a kicker or a puncher, soft, squashy material will work for you - a squeezer might prefer uncooked rice so the doll feels grainy.

@summary
stitch the opening closed.

 This will be your pattern. When drawing your outline, think about things that will make your stress doll easier to use. It may be helpful to consider that:


Larger dolls are easier to use, because they're better for punching or just squeezing like a stress ball.
Making the shape of your doll very simple can help - rather than making a detailed and precise sketch, try to make the doll round shaped or long, making it easier to use so that various bits and bobs of the doll don't get in your way.;
, Remember that the fabric you use can be symbolic and helpful, rather than just anything. For example, fabric in a calming color, such as blue, may help you remember that things will settle eventually. Or you can use a more violent colour such as red, to help get rid of the anger and stress and so you feel like the doll means something. You can also cut the 2 sides of the doll out in different colours, so one side may be an angry/stressful colour, and then the next side calm, so that you can use the angry side and then the peaceful.
 Check for any inaccuracies in your cutting or overall shape and fix them quickly. When pinning, be sure to line the edges up carefully.
 Remove any pins that you come across as you are sewing. Leave a small section, at least 1-inch long, open.
 Make sure that you stuff the doll well, but are able to sew up the side.
 If you want, you can draw a face or other features on your doll or just leave it blank. Remember that no design is right or wrong - all that matters is that the doll works for you.
