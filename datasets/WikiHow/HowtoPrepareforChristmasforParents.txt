if you plan to make a traditional christmas cake from scratch then this needs to be started at least a month before christmas.

@summary
christmas shopping can be very stressful with all the crowds and you can't take the children with you because they will see their presents.

@summary
christmas for kids is all about the presents but make sure that you don't just buy them toys, buy the things they actually need as well.

@summary
many children creep around the house while their parents are in another room on the hunt for their presents.

@summary
before you wrap the presents carefully remove them from the box and check that they are not broken or damaged.

@summary
buy enough batteries and one extra pack of each just in case.

@summary
when you put up the decorations let the kids help.

 If you have forgotten never fear; you can buy ready-made cakes in a store.;
, If you have kids get them to write out a list for you. That way you know what they most desire. You do not have to buy everything on their list; just get a few of the items and the rest is up to you. Also a good tip for Christmas shopping if you have children is to leave them with a trusted adult. If you do this make sure you tell the adult what they are to eat in case of any allergies.
 Most parents buy nothing but toys for their children, and by Boxing Day the kids want something else, so make sure you buy them things such as clothes, vests, socks, handkerchiefs, pajamas, combs etc.
 To prevent this, wrap their gifts, lock them in a secure cupboard and make sure the key(s) are always with you.
 Also keep your receipts so in such a case you can replace the damaged item. If the toy needs to be assembled then as to avoid the hassle on Christmas day and the possible injury of your children due to them fiddling with dangerous tools, assemble them before they get wrapped.
 There is nothing worse than receiving a present that you badly wanted and then discovering that you can't use it because you have run out of batteries.
 Also buy each of your kids a set of decorations and tell them that they are theirs to put on the tree wherever they want. This will make them feel special and included.
 So on Christmas Eve arrange some relaxing activities for the kids to do all day while you prepare for the busy day ahead.
 Instead have some healthy water, juice and fruit snacks laid out on a table for them so that you won't have to get any snacks for them which means interruption.
, Christmas is after all the most wonderful time of the year!
