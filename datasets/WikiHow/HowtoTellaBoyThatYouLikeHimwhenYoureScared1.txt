 Make sure it's during your free time in class or at lunch. You don't want your teacher to see you writing a note during a lesson, or he/she might read it in front of the class!


You can write something like "I Like you" and write the first letter of your name or your initials. It may save you from embarrassment if he doesn't know who it is right away, therefor he might not tell many people. You might also want to write not to tell anyone about the note.;
, Make sure he doesn't see you put it in there. You should rush to his locker right after class.
 You can smile at him in class if you want.



If he listened to what you said in the note, he wouldn't have told anybody, and he may ask you how you knew about the note, and if he doesn't figure it out right away, tell him that you wrote it.
