 Taking a bath relaxes you and gets you clean. You could put candles around if you want. To add even more spa day touch put some sweet smelling oils in your bath.;
, Air dry yourself if it's possible. Then moisturize with some nice smelling lotions.
 You can mix baking soda and water till it's paste. Paint it on and let it sit for a couple minutes. Then rinse it off.
 You can buy or make one. To make one, mix 1/4 cup of sugar, 1-2 tablespoons of softened butter, and 3 tablespoons of honey in a microwavable container. Put the mix in the microwave for 10-15 seconds. Last, mix until it's smooth, not runny. Slap it on your face and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Use an icy washcloth to wipe it off.
 When you're finished dry them on a towel and rub them with lotion. Dab lotion on a cotton ball and put them between your toes. Let them sit for 5 minutes.
 Soak them for 10 minutes.
 Don't clip them to far. The white bit it a good mark to stop at.
 Get someone else to paint them if you can. Sometimes it can be hard to do yourself. Before you paint them you can push back you cuticles. Let them dry for 20 minutes to be safe.
 Then get into your pajamas or some comfy clothes. Curl up and read a book  or watch a movie.
