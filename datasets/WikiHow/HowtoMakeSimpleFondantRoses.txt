 If you are colouring it, do this beforehand.
 This will be the centre of your rose, so change the size depending on how big you want your rose to be., Pinch at the bottom., Wrap this in the same manner around the first 'petal'., Occasionally add another petal until your rose is the desired size. As you add more layers, make sure that they are not pressed right up against the last layer at the top., You can also make the rounded end of the tear drop wavy or uneven, to give the rose a more natural look., Once you are happy with your rose, leave to dry in a cool, dry area, to prevent the fondant from becoming sticky, for one day. They can be left for less time, but this is for best results., Once dried, the roses can be placed on cakes, cookies or other baked goods as needed.
