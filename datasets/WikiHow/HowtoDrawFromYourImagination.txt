 Perhaps you would like to draw an animal. If you are not sure which animal to choose, you could look up animals in an encyclopedia, to get some ideas. Or maybe you would like to draw a fantasy character. Again, if you are at a loss for what to draw, read some fairy tales, as these are rich in suggestions.;
, If you don't have any ideas, look at other peoples art for ideas. Look for things you might want to try, see what techniques they use, or just say, "I can do that!"

,, At first do your picture lightly with a pencil so you don't see the mistakes, and when you're happy with the picture, darken the lines or ink it.
 If your subject is a toaster, look at a toaster and try to zero in on the essential details, so that you can draw them. You will probably want slots for the bread, and some controls for turning on the toaster.
 Think about what your character or other subject would inhabit.For example if your subject is a cow, you could draw a barn, or a field. If your subject is a space alien, draw a distant planet. If your subject is a box of cereal, draw the breakfast table, or the inside of a kitchen cupboard.
 Perhaps a lovely dress for a princess, or a sports uniform for a ball player.
