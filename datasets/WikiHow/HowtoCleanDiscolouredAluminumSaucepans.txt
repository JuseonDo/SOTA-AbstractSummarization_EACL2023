 The amount will depend on how many pots you are planning on cleaning.;
,, If you need to fill the pan, add more peel.
 Keep an eye on the boiling process and when you see the discolouration lift and the shine return, the pot can be removed.
 It is a good idea to reuse the completely cooled water to water plants rather than waste it down the drain.
