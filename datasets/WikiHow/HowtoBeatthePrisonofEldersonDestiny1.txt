 If you don't have any friends who aren't online playing Destiny, or don't have Destiny at all, try completing the Prison of Elders at level 28. You'll be able to complete it nice and easily. Go to your Director and check the Reef. There it is next to the Vestian Outpost.
 You will be matched with two randoms and must complete all five rounds., Kill the enemies and deal with the critical objectives.,, The door below you will open and you will need to maneuver your way to the Treasure Room.,
