@summary
grip the club with your dominant hand on the shaft near the hosel (the part of the club that connects the head with the shaft) with the clubface facing skyward.

@summary
hold the ball a few inches over the clubface and drop the ball on the face.

@summary
on the next try, let the ball bounce more than once, keeping the clubface directly under the ball.

@summary
after you develop more than a few bounces, move your hand further up the shaft to the grip end like tiger.

, Try to catch the ball after one hop.
 You can maintain the bouncing by slightly pulling up on the clubface while the ball is falling down on it. There is definitely a timing element similar to the old paddle game, so don't practice this anywhere near your golf course or buddies unless you want a new nickname.
 The clubface should point directly to the sky so a glass of water could rest on it. By selecting a club with any angle that is 56Â°(sand wedge) and above, you will have the largest, flattest clubface in the bag. If you use a driver or other "wood," you can bounce the ball on different sides of the clubface to see the gear effect of spin on a clubface that has bulge and roll.
 This is accomplished by cradling the ball back on the face by reducing the hit on the ball. Angling the clubface and missing the sweet spot can also reduce the bounce. Once the ball begins to stop bouncing, keep the face under the ball and let it settle on the clubface.
 Practice this first without any bouncing. When you can reduce the bounce, the stopping will become easier. Getting the ball to stop is like the marble in the maze game. You have to keep tilting the clubface to keep the ball level and centered. Once it stops, just jumpstart it again.
