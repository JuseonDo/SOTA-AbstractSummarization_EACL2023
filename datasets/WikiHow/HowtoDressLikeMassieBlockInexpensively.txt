massie dresses very maturely, as well as cute and chic.

@summary
the best places to shop are macy's (if you can afford it), charlotte russe, h&m, abercrombie and fitch, nordstroms, wet seal, and other stores or websites that have gorgeous and hot couture style clothes for less.

it's essential to buy stuff that you know will go with other things, so you don't buy a red and white blazer and nothing to go with it.

@summary
remember that massie almost never wears pants.
@article
 Her style consists of layering amazing pieces such as blazers, ruffle tops, mini skirts, dresses, leggings, and all kinds of shoes. She wears all labels, but that doesn't mean she's hard to emulate if you have not much money to spend. Generally, she has a cross between a preppy style and a rich girl style (throughout the books this is called "unique");
, Pick out pieces that you like and Massie would wear, not just anything you see that looks like she would adore, if you don't like it.
 Massie would probably wear something like a slouchy gray dress with a turquoise cami underneath and a tangle of silver necklaces and turquoise flats. Also, she might wear dark wash denim skinny jeans, slouchy dark brown boots, a denim blazer, and a solid colored v-neck if she was feeling very casual.
 She usually wears a cute skirt or mini dress, even in winter. If you do wear pants, wear skinny or flared jeans. Cashmere is expensive but worth it if pursuing her look. Massie also never wears sweats, unless it's the weekend or time for bed. On the weekend she usually settles with designer sweatsuits, but you don't have to.
