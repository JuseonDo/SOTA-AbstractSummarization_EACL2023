, Generally speaking (for color photos), the warmer the temperature, the faster the colors will fade. Most photos will store well in your house between 50 and 75 degrees F. If you’re looking to store your photographs for decades to come, keep them in a proper storage container and put them in a room with low humidity and a temperature below 35F. The general rule for both humidity and temperature is “the lower, the better”.
 The basement is too humid for storing photographs (and prone to flooding), and the attic is too dry. Temperature and humidity fluctuations will cause your prints to curl, warp and crack. Exposure to light will quickly fade them (especially sunlight!).
 If you want to pair a photo with a newspaper clipping, it’s best to photocopy the clipping onto acid-free paper. If you need to write on your photos, write directly on them with a pencil. Do not use pen or marker, and do not use any kind of adhesive label (the chemicals in the adhesive will cause problems). Avoid paper clips and rubber-bands, which can easily damage your photos.
