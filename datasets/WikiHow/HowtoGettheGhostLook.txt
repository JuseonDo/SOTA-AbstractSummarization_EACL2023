 Flaming red may also work. Grow your hair as long as you can. While you're growing your hair out, only trim it when you start to get split ends. Braid it every night before you go to sleep to prevent it from tangling. Try to keep the shine low. If you have pretty dark skin, keep your hair black put it in ringlets.;
, If you have dark skin, don't get a foundation 10 times lighter than your actual skin color- this is really tacky. Then spread moisturizer over your face to smooth out your makeup. Apply a foundation one shade darker than the foundation you are wearing under your cheekbones.
 Spread charcoal or black eyeshadow over your lids and slightly over your eye crease if you have one. If you don't have an eye crease, spread it to the middle of your eyelid.
 If your skin is medium, apply bright red lipstick. If your skin is light, apply white lipstick. Put on black or red contacts on if you want. Grey, light blue, pale pink and overly bright natural colors work well also.
, If they are spider web, spider or skeleton, leave them as they are.
, Wear clothing that would be underwear in another era as outerwear, such as bloomers as shorts, petticoats as skirts, slips as dress, corsets as tops. Wear socks and hoodies with bones on them.
 Lockets, wilted roses as pins, barbed wire hearts are very Ghost. Onyx, jet, gold, fake gold and amethysts and other crystals are best. Imitations are great too.
