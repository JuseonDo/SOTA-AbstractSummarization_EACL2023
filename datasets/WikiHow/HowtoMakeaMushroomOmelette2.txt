 For a lighter omelette, use 4 egg whites instead.The water will evaporate when you fry the eggs, and help make them fluffier in the end., If you are using whole eggs (instead of whites), make sure that you break the yolks up. You won't be scrambling the eggs once you add them into the frying pan.
 The butter will start to sizzle and foam. Don't add the eggs yet. Instead, wait until the foam starts to disappear., Once you have the eggs on the pain, continue tilting the pan around until the entire bottom is evenly covered with the egg mixture.If necessary, use the tip of your spatula to help spread the egg mixture across the bottom of the pan.


For extra flavor, add 2 chopped, green shallots., This will happen after only a few seconds. Pulling the edges of the omelette away from the pan will allow the raw egg mixture to flow onto the hot pan and cook. , As it continues to cook, it will turn opaque and set. Don't "scramble" the omelette during this time, or you will get scrambled eggs instead.
 Only cover half of the omelette with the mushroom mixture; you will be folding the omelette in half. Don't worry, the omelette will continue to cook, even after you take it off the frying pan.


If you'd like some extra flavor, add Â¼ cup (25 grams) of shredded cheese. Popular choices include: cheddar, parmesan, and gruyere., Use your spatula to gently separate the edges of the omelette from the frying pan. Then, slip the spatula under the bare side of the omelette, and flip it over onto the mushroom side., If you'd like, you an garnish the omelette with some chopped chives, parsley, or grated cheese. Don't wait too long, however, or the mushrooms will turn greasy and cold.
