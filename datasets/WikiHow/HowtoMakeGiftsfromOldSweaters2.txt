 Choose large sweaters for this craft because you are going to need to shrink them before you begin sewing., Place them in the wash on the hottest setting. Then, place them in the dryer on the hottest setting., You will be able to use both sides. The sweaters will also be flatter and easier to cut in this fashion., It will be easier to measure exactly with these tools and a plastic measuring board that is 6 inches (15.2 cm) wide., Place a sweater on the self-healing mat and put the 6 inch (15.2 cm) measuring board above it. Use a rotary cutter or sharp fabric scissors to cut along the edge., Repeat this with your 3 different sweaters, until you have 11 blocks. You will sew along the 6-inch (15.2 cm) width., Pick contrasting or complimentary thread on your sewing machine and set it to the zig-zag stitch. Line up 2 blocks next to each other and stitch them down the center, so the zig-zag grasps both sides., Embellish the sweater scarf with buttons, yarn or ribbon.
