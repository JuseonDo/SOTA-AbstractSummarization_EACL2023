 These are the plastic or wooden hangers with notches cut out of the top section so that you can hang items with straps.;
, Yarn is easier for younger children, while line or twine may be better for older children for its sophisticated look.
 They should be at least four oz. containers and have a large lip. Wash them out and dry them thoroughly.


You can also use plastic drinking cups.
 You will want to grab a hole punch or small pointy awl for punching holes in the plastic. It is best that adults handle this single portion of the project.
 Make sure your child can reach them all.
 Hold the hanger up and show how the hanger tips from side to side when there are weights at either end. Show that you will hang items on either side to balance the scale and compare items by their weight.
 A fabric measuring tape is perfect for this use. Divide the circumference by three, since you will make three equidistant holes in each cup.


For example, if it is six inches long, you will want to mark a hole every two inches.
Try to do the sums together with your child. This is a great simple math activity for a school-aged child.
 Repeat on the other plastic cup.
 Do this part of the project yourself. You can also tape the yarn to the cup if you want this to be a child-only activity.
 They should be about one foot long.
 Repeat with three holes in the yogurt cup and tie the three pieces together at the top. Tie a loop into the top as well, so that you can hang the cups.


Repeat with the other plastic cup.
 Repeat with the other cup. Make sure the cups are secure and even before you start to play.,, Place some beans in one end, and then ask them to fill the other section until the weight is even.
 Have your child weight figures on either side until they are even.
 Tell them that every decoration must be exactly the same on each side to ensure it weighs items properly. Discuss a mirror image or symmetrical image to further their learning.
