 Round out the pointy end so it looks more like a large almond.;
, Make them like fish scales, vaguely trapezoidal and becoming smaller towards either end, with bigger sections in the middle.
 Detail the scales' shape.
 Finish up with a little stem on top of the cone, with short vertical lines to indicate the fractures in the wood.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional.
 Erase the pencil and add in color. Pine cones on the ground tend to come in shades of brown, but if yours happens to be in a tree it might be green or something else entirely. It's up to you!
