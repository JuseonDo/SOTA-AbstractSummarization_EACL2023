 Place potato cut side down in some baking soda to coat the flat side lightly with baking soda. You can pour a little bit of baking soda on a plate dip the potato in as it rubs off.


If you don't have baking soda, some people say the plain potato will work, or you can use the potato with a little bit of dishwashing liquid on it.
