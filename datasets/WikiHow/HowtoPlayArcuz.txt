,,,, When you get your points, you will go to the bottom of the screen and click Char, to distribute your five points, and skill, to use your one point.
,, You can compose many different things. A stone of blessing can compose small then medium crystal elements to items. Stone of Soul can compose large crystal elements to items. And Stone of Holy can compose large crystal elements (after Stone of Soul) to items.
 Small Health + Small Mana = Small Rejuvenation. Small Health, Mana, or Rejuvenation + itself equals Medium Potion. Two Same Mediums = One Large.
 It kind of follows the same rule as potions. Small + Small = Medium Medium + Medium = Large. There are four different elements. And if you take three different elements of the same size, and compose, you get the other element.
