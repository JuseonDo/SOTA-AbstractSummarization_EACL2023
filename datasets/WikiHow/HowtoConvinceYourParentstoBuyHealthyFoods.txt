, If you're eating healthy, this will show that you're capable of eating healthy and resisting junk food.
 Sometimes a neat thing to do is going to the store with your parent(s). Pick out the foods that you are interested in.
 This might also convince them if they would like to lose more weight.
 Parents will then understand that you are serious about this. Sometimes sibling support works also if some of the siblings would like eating healthier as well.
 Get the other parent on your side, have a family get together, and discuss how you want to improve the amount of healthy food you buy.
 Lots of healthy foods can be categorized as organic, which are more expensive that regular foods. Don't make your family buy a bunch of pricey stuff, there are lots of foods out there with great prices, you just have to know where to look.
 Let them notice you having this change every time so they will be influenced to do the same. If you make an effort and try to eat healthy, hopefully your parents will too.
 In this way, they will be educated and soon follow what you have done.
