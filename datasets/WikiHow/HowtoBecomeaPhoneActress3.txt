,, Many searches will net you which companies to avoid and which ones pay the best.
 It is imperative to know what you are talking about before a customer gets you on the phone. A customer that has to explain to you what he or she is talking about will most likely find another phone actress to do business with.



Trolling means that you will most likely be paid a higher rate, but must bring in customers as well as the ones supplied to you. You can do this by having a website or through advertising.
Some companies will send every client to you without any work on your part, but these usually pay a lower rate since they are doing all of the work in bringing in new customers.
