 If you were given a gift card to an e-commerce site or retail location that you can’t use, you can sell it on the Internet or trade it in.
 It is a good idea to compare the amount of cash on each of these sites or similar sites so that you can get the largest percentage back.
 If it is not listed, either request to sell it through the customer service section or move on to another website that deals in those gift cards.
 You will need a shipping address and email address.
 The site will check the balance and tell you how much you can gain in cash or trade on the site.
 You may be able to get more back through trade than with the cash option. Some sites let you choose the store you would like to trade for, while others will issue a trade to Amazon.
 Ship your gift card using the shipping label that is given., Use it within the expiration date given.
