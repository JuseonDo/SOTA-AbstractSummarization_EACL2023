 This is the better method for people who have less patience, but have more time on their hands. To start, you must have beaten the normal type trial and rescued Nebby from Melemele Meadow.
  The grass should be located on an overhang on the east.  Run around in the grass until you find a bagon.  Bagon has a pretty low encounter rate, so it will take a while to encounter.,  Then paralyze it or put it to sleep to make it easier to catch.,  After you have caught it, put it in your party.  Now you need to train Bagon.

The easiest method to train Bagon would be turning the Exp. Share on and taking on the Pokémon League over and over.
  When Shelgon reaches level 50, Shelgon will evolve, and you will have yourself your very own Salamence!

To evolve Bagon and Shelgon faster, use rare candies and EXP boost drinks found in Poke Pelago.
