@summary
pull the hook outwards of the fish's mouth where the hook curves and try to get the hook out of the throat.

@summary

 Determine if you need pliers (preferably needle-nose) or just a steady hand.;
, Use caution in this method. Getting the barb of the hook stuck will make things a lot more difficult. Instead, "snap" the barb with a pair of pliers to allow smoother retrieval of the hook. Snapping the barb means to crush it down towards the main hook so it cannot get caught on the fish. if this does not work, do not leave the hook in and cut your line.
 Fish have a diaphragm in the back of their throat which opens briefly and closes immediately while eating.
 Make sure you have slack on the line, as the hook needs to move freely.
 This may be tricky and can take some time. You should end up with the hook out of the mouth, yet with fishing line almost weaved through the fishes throat.
 This way, you do not lose your hook, you just need to tie your line back with a Blood Knot.
