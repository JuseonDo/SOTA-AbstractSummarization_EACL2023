, The Kindle 2 will initially sort your books on your Home screen by "Most Recent First", but there are also methods to sort by Title, Author, and even by Collection.


Within the Collections option, it will also sort the remainder of the books that aren't entered into a collection, by Most Recent First.
 If you are in a book, press the Home button near the bottom of the device.
 You'll see the selection change from the top most item on your device to the line reading "Showing all (x) items" and "By Most Recent First".
 This will then implement a new menu in place of the last one temporarily.
