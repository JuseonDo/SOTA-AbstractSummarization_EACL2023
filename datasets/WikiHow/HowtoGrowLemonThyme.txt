 If you are planting more than one bush, plant them with 25 centimeter (9.8 in) intervals.;
, It should be well-draining. Enrich the soil by adding a small amount of compost. Fertilise each plant lightly.
 If you don't do this, the centre of the plant is likely to die back. It has fine roots that grow as high as 20 centimeter (7.9 in) and there is no main stem, so it relies heavily on moisture to keep it thriving.
