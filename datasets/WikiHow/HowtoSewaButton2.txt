 Select a suitable button and thread that matches the button, the garment, and any thread used to sew on other buttons.
 If you like, you can double the thread to make this job quicker. Simply pull it through the needle so that there is an equal length of thread extending from both sides.
 One way to tie a knot is to wrap the thread around your finger as shown, roll the thread between your fingers, and pull it tight. If you doubled the thread, tie the ends together. Leave a long tail of thread, whether you are doubling the thread or using a single thread to sew the button.
 Line the button up with the other buttons on the garment. Check the buttonhole. Close the opposite flap or panel where you want it and make sure that the button lines up with the buttonhole.
 Pull the thread all the way through on each stitch.
 Place a straight pin beneath the button, between the stitch you have made and where the next stitch will go, in order to keep the button from being stitched too tight.
 Pull the thread all the way through.
,,,, Wrap the thread six times around the thread between the button and the material to reinforce the shank you have created.
, Make a few stitches below the button, going back and forth to make them strong. Tie this thread off.
