 Let's say the ionic compound you're working with is NaCl., Na is sodium. So, write Sodium.
 Cl is chlorine. To add the "ide" ending, just drop the last syllable, "-ine," and add "-ide" instead. Chlorine becomes chloride.
 NaCl can be written as sodium chloride.
 Once you've gotten this formula down, try naming a few more simple ionic compounds. Even memorizing a few can help you have a better understanding of how to name ionic compounds. Here are a few more:


Li2S = Lithium sulfide






Ag2S = Silver sulfide






MgCl2 = Magnesium chloride
