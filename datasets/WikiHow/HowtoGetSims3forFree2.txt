 This is a program that allows you to connect to other Internet users using BitTorrent file sharing protocol so you can download Sims 3. Examples of popular, reputable BitTorrent clients are uTorrent, Azureus, and BitTorrent.
 A BitTorrent directory is a search engine that allows you to find torrents for movies, television shows, apps, games, and music. Examples of top torrent sites are The Pirate Bay, ExtraTorrent, and KickassTorrents., Some BitTorrent directories allow you to search by game. For example, if using The Pirate Bay, place a checkmark next to “Games” and search “Sims 3.”

, Seeders are other BitTorrent users sharing or “hosting” those particular torrents so files can be downloaded faster by users (known as leechers).
 This allows you to view comments and details about the file, such as OS compatibility, file type, and file size.
 This adds the torrent file to your BitTorrent client. The magnet link is usually labeled “magnet link,” or features the icon of a magnet.
,, The Sims 3 will now be available in your default Downloads folder.
