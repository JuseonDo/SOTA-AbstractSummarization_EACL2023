 Use the original directions or instructions according to the recipe of your choice. Set the cake aside to cool completely.
 In a large bowl, combine the milk and pudding. Whisk the mixture until smooth., Use the round tip at the end of a wooden spoon to create evenly portioned holes throughout the entire cake., Pour the pudding over the cake, filling in the holes as best as you can., Distribute the Oreos evenly, covering the cake., Use plastic wrap to cover the cake and place it in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours. This allows the filling to absorb into the cake.
