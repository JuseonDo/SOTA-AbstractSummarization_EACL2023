 The tough green skin will not make a smooth juice.;
, It should be entirely liquid by the time you are done. Cucumber juice is cool and soothing on irritated skin.
 Once they are thoroughly mixed you can set them aside.
 This paste will be grainy and should be relatively thick.
 The cornmeal will rub off environmental pollutants and flaking or dead skin cells without taking moisture away from lower layers of skin.
 Do not dry your hands when you are done.
 It will not all soak in right away.
 The cucumber will soothe your skin and help it heal. Rubber gloves will keep the moisturizing treatment in while protecting clothes and furniture.
 Make sure that all of the cucumber-honey lotion is gone from your hands. You can apply regular moisturizer to your hands at this time if you wish. Repeat this treatment 3 times a week until your chapped hands are healed. Then keep them moisturized to prevent the problem from happening again.
