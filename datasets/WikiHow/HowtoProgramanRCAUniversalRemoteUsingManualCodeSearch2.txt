 If youâ€™re unable to do an automatic code search and cannot enter the device code manually, try a Manual Code Search. Start by powering on the device that you want to control (e.g., your DVD player, stereo receiver).You'll only be able to use your RCA remote with devices that support remote control in the first place. If the device did not come with a remote, you likely won't be able to use your RCA remote to control it.
 Keep the remote pointed at the device during the code search process.
 For example, to program the remote for a DVD player, press the DVD button. The Power light will turn on.
 Continue to hold until the light turns off and then on again.
 Now your remote will try different codes in an attempt to turn off the device. Once the proper code is found (typically after about five seconds), the device will turn off.
 Do this only if the device did not turn off after five seconds. Pressing Play or Slow again will tell the remote to try the next batch of codes. Repeat this every five seconds until the device turns off.
 This should turn it back on again. You may have to press this multiple times to find the correct code.
 Once the device turns back on after pressing the Reverse button, you've found the correct code. Press Stop to lock it into your remote.Note: Universal remotes can be finicky, and you may need to start the process over if something goes wrong. Make sure you are keeping the remote pointed at the device, and that you follow each step exactly.
