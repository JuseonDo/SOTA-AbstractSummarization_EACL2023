 You'll find out why later.
 Just stay there for a second, and whatever you do, do NOT go into his space., Let the door close, leaving you safe, and leaving Sarge trapped with his minions., This is what you needed the whip for, and even though any other weapon works, this one's probably the easiest., Remember, Sarge only has three lives, so on your third hit, he'll fall, opening both doors for you., You defeated Sarge!
