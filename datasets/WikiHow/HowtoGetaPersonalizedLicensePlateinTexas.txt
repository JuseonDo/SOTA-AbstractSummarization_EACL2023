, Eligible vehicles include passenger, light truck, motorcycle, trailer, travel trailer, motor homes and private buses.
 Category options range from Custom, T-Plate, Luxury or simple Background only plates.


Luxury plates are the most expensive, but they offer the most options in plate choices and message combinations.
The Custom series has the same background options as the Luxury series, however the message choices are limited to specific number and letter combinations.
The T-Series is a great option if your preferred message is already in use, as it places a T (for Texas) at the beginning of your message.
The Design series is the least expensive option. You can pick from one of 18 specialty plate background designs, but the message is selected at random.
 If your message is not available for purchase, you will have to choose a new one.


Most messages consist of up to six characters.
Several symbols are available, including the International Symbol of Access (ISA) for disabled people.
 At this time you will pay the appropriate fee and choose the local County Tax Assessor-Collector for the plates to be mailed. The fee will be $30-$200 per year based on design and the number of years you pay in advance.
