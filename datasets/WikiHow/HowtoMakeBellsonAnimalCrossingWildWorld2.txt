 However, note that this method does not always work, so try it to see but don't lose the plot if it fails to work out.

If it fails, the money that you were trying to clone will be on your town's ground or in your friend's pocket.
Sometimes it is possible that the bells will disappear during the transaction, and you can't get them back, but this is very rare.
Scorpions, tarantulas, grasshoppers, long locusts, migratory locus, crickets and bell crickets can't be caught while doing this.
, With the other character, pick it up.,, The game will say wireless communications has ended, so tap the screen/press A., The bells should have been cloned., Once the pockets are full, write 10 letters in the visitors pocket, and add the money as presents., Finally, once your town has been completely filled with bells, put it all in the bank to get rewards (after you reach a total of about 25,000.000, your monthly interest will be at it's highest, which is 99,999 bells).
