 These are listed below.;
, Make sure it fits with ease as you need to egg to fit back together properly.
 Cut two pipe cleaners to a suitable length and curl up one end of each.
, Bend back once inside, to prevent the pipe cleaner from slipping back out.
, The eyes can be made to really stand out by using white sticky labels and using these as the canvas backing; simply draw an outer ring and an inner pupil for each eye and stick in place.
 Fireflies have six legs, so cut size pieces of even size and bend to leg shape. Make sure it is a strong leg stance, as it needs to hold up the bug––use plenty of pipe cleaner. As with the antennae, stick the thumbtack in to insert in evenly spaced leg positions and bend back on the inside of the egg to prevent the legs from falling back out.
 Make a little pair of wings out of the shiny paper or duct tape. Attach with glue, or if using duct tape, stick straight on. However, be careful not to prevent the egg from being open and closed because you need to be able to access the artificial candle. Only attach the wings after the join of the second piece which forms the back of the firefly.
, Leave the tea light candle turned off when not in use. To use, unscrew the firefly, flip the switch to on, and place the firefly back together again.


Arrange where they can be admired most, such as on the dining table or buffet counter, or on a shelf where people congregate. They look very effective when placed against the dark background of night, in an evenly spaced row.
