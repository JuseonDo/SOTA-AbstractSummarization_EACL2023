use the pillow as the body of the mannequin.

 Measure your chest, waist, and hips. Write these numbers down.;

Mark the spots on the pillow with a pencil where your chest, waist and hips are, according to the measurements you've just taken.
 This may be challenging to get through, but it is worth the patient effort required. The end result should be shaped a little like a human torso.
 This is to check that you've pinned the pillow in accurately. If the measurements don't match your initial ones, then keep adjusting with the safety pins. If it matches, move on.
 Safety pin it to be the shape the pillow was. Then, insert the pole behind the pillow and there should be a bump sticking out of the top of the pillow; this is now the neck.
 Set up the mannequin onto a wall or corner and its ready to use!
