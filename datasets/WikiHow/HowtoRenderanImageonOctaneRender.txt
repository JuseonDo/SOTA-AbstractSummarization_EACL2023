,,,, Select the obj file.


The default controls are shown in the image. You can also select a preset for your 3D program.
 Specular, diffuse color, and UV mapping are imported from the obj file. You can quickly find the material for an object by using the material picker tool. Play around with different materials.
 The background will change the color of ambient light. You can choose an image, or a realistic simulation of outdoors, using the 'daylight' option at the top., This is in the 'Current Camera' panel. The icons on the right side are for selecting different panels.,, These settings will define the quality of the image. An important setting to keep in mind is Max Samples, which stops the render when however many samples are rendered.
 The sample count should be above 1500 for a noise-less image.
