 The ingredients you should be grabbing are: 1.Instant hot chocolate mix,whatever brand you like, 2.Water, or milk if you would like it to be creamy. 3.Vanilla ice cream. You should also get all the bowls, cups and utensils too. You'll need a medium sized microwave safe bowl, larger coffee/teacup, ice cream scoop, a measuring spoon and a wire whisk to mix with.;
,, Take out the bowl when done, (Careful! it could be hot!) and check the temperature. If it is too cold, heat it for another two and a half minutes until it is perfect. If it is fine just like that, you can move on to the next step.
 Pour your concoction into the mug and add whatever you want, a candy mint to add a minty aftertaste, or sprinkles to make it colorful.
, Go sit by a cozy fireplace, and drink you wonderful Hot chocolate float.
