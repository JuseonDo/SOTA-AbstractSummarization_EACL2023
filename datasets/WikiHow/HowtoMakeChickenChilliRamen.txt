 Add the shallots, ginger, garlic, carrots, and chilli and stir gently.;
, Then add the soy sauce, rice wine, and broth. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Stir everything together and let it simmer slowly for about 15 to 20 minutes.
 Discard the solids and place the new pan with the broth back on the heat.
 Poach the chicken and simmer for 7 minutes.


Be careful as a strong boil will make the chicken tough and dry; try to achieve a slow simmer so that the chicken gets tender and moist.
 Pour the ramen noodles into the broth for about 2 to 3 minutes. Be aware and don't let the noodles overcook.
 Cut the chicken into slices (against the grain) and place a few chicken slices in the bowls. Garnish the bowls with cucumber, red pepper, spring onions, and coriander. Top everything with chilli oil.
