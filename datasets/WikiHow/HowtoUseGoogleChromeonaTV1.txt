 To use Google Chrome on your television, you’ll need have a Chromecast already hooked up to your television.


This method will work for the Windows, Mac, and ChromeOS versions of the browser.;
, If your computer is not already connected to Wi-Fi, connect now., Chrome has a built-in “Cast” feature that allows you to send a Chrome tab to your TV.
 Load up a website, such as wikiHow.com, so you’ll have something to cast to the TV.
 The Settings menu will expand.
, You’ll see two options—“Cast tab” and “Cast desktop.”

,, Depending on the amount of Google Cast-supported devices on the network, you may see several devices listed.
 In a few seconds, the site you loaded in the browser will appear on your television screen.


You can browse to other websites while casting to the TV—just be sure you’re staying in the correct browser tab.
 When you’re ready to stop using Chrome on your TV, either close the browser tab or click “Stop.”
