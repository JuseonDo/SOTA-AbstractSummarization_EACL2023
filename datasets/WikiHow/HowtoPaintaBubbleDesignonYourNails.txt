,, This can help your nail polish last longer and reduce the chance of "staining" your nails.
 You can do light gray or white. Alternatively you can use the clear base coat as the background.
 Continue adding coats until the color is as opaque as you want. This can be anywhere from 1-3 coats of polish.
 You can get dark or light blue, but keep in mind that this will be the color of your bubbles.
 Triangular make-up sponges work well.
 Make sure that the square is about half the size of your nail. It is better to have the square too big than small. Be sure to do this fast, because you don't want the polish to dry!

, Be sure that this square is touching the white square, and that they are very close to the same size.
 Make sure that your nail is vertical. Half of your nail should be white and the other half blue.
, You want to have something to draw the bubbles on your nails with.
 These are going to be your bubbles! Try to keep the amount of bubbles even.
, You can even use these just do add a little rim to your nails, or add some tiny dots in the bubbles for an extra touch! Keep in mind that this is optional.
 This will strengthen your nails, the polish, and help keep the design to stay on for a longer amount of time. It will also give you a fab finish!

, You can use polish remover, or just a cleanser on a q-tip!
