, Work together for about 5 minutes using the wooden spatula.
 Add them in one at a time.
 Mix each portion of flour in with the whisk.
 Pipe lines about 5cm/2 inches in length. Leave plenty of space between each biscuit line (about 2.5cm/1 inch) to allow spreading space.
 Bake the biscuits for about 8 minutes.

 These biscuits are perfect for accompanying a soft dessert or for enjoying with a cup of tea.
