if you're doing this club at school, ask the principal if you could hold an anime convention after school, and your anime club will host it.

 Cosplaying is always fun! You shouldn't cosplay everyday, maybe just once a month. You can have contests, re-enact scenes, etc.;
, After you can talk about it, what you liked, what you didn't like, etc. Be careful because there might be some arguments.
 Have everyone draw some anime fan-art, and you can pick three winners!

, Some of these are Pokémon, Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, etc.
 Go over the rules, they can be found at http://www.pokemon.com/ Have a tournament and see who wins!

,,,, You will need money, so keep that in mind. Maybe your club could have a fund raiser for the convention.
