 Find the number you marked down when you solved for the area of one of the matching ends and double it to account for the other end.
 If your prism has triangular ends, you will be adding up three sides; if they’re pentagonal, you will be adding five sides; etc. If the prism is cylindrical, you don’t have to add anything as there’s only one “side”.
 This gives you the total surface area of the prism.
