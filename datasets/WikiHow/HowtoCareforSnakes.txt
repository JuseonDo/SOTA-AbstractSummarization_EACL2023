 Find out everything you possibly can about your snake, take into account the lifespan, size of tank and housing requirements very carefully. Be realistic about these, if you realize that you actually can't do this, you are not a failure and are in fact saving an animal from what would have been a stressful life.;
, Just because a pet store is small doesn't mean that they are bad.
 It should feel muscular and strong, with no signs of mites. You should not be able to see the spine, as this will indicate a seriously underweight snake. There should also be clear eyes nose and mouth, as this can lead to a respiratory infection.
 Can you guarantee that this is a purebred *Snake breed*? Can you give me accurate records of shedding? How much does he eat, how often and on what days? Has he been interacted with and properly tamed? Where do you get your stock from?

, Equipment includes a vivarium, water bowl, substrate, something for the snake to climb, heat mat (Only covering half the vivarium), a light (Optional), thermometer, hydrometer and two hides, one in the cold side and one in the hot. You can get very good bargains at pet stores on equipment.
 Fit any wires and decorations, and attach the heat mat. allow at least 3 days for the temperature to regulate.
 Make sure nobody will be in the room that it is being taken care of in.
,,, That way, if you reach in to hold him, he won't think "FOOD!"
