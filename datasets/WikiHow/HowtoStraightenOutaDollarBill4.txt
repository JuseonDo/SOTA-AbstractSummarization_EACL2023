 It doesn't have to be super full, but must be able to fully coat the entire bill from one end to the other. The basin though, has to have a flat bottom for this fix to hold. It doesn't matter what side the bill is placed in the basin with, for the side facing you, however, for simplicity, start with the front side facing you first.


Be careful of the temperature of the water. Although the water should be warm, it should never be scalding hot, as this could cause the bill to loose color.
 About a teaspoon or two might be enough. Two teaspoons will make it stiffer yet, but even closer to brand new than just the one teaspoon.
 Rub the bill from one end to the other. Don't apply too much pressure that the bill's ink begins to come off, otherwise it will have no legal tender on it. Apply enough pressure, like you were brushing your hair- steady pressure running up and down the bill.


Rub the bill in circles with the bristle brush. Never rub straight across otherwise the bill's ink will smear and that's not good!

, Repeat the process with the bristles to the back side of the bill.
 The soap helps restore the crispness that the bill once had when it came from the factory.
 Listen for the little "ticks"; these ticking sounds are the water droplets evaporating from the newly washed bill. Again, the side you begin with really doesn't matter. Don't ever spray any of the water from the iron onto the bill, unless the iron is sticking to the bill for some reason.
, The bill should now look closer to knew than it once was.
