 If you have thick hair, you'll want to use a smaller section than those with thin hair.;
,, Dip your brush into the water and brush your to-be bangs down so they are hanging over your face. The wet brush will dampen your bangs to ensure an even cut.
 Grab the hair that falls between the outer ends of your eyes. Hold it placing your middle and index finger at the length you want the shortest part of your bangs to be.
 Use your fingers as a barrier so that you don't cut too short. For a less straight edge cut, cut the bangs while the scissors are pointed vertically. You can also use this method after making the initial horizontal cut.



Beginner's tip: Cut your bangs a little longer than is ideal at first and see how you like itâ€”you can always cut more later if it's too long, but once it's too short you'll just have to wait for it to grow back.
 Use the same technique outlined in the previous step, but make sure that this portion is slightly longer than the middle one. Repeat for the same amount of hair on the left side.
 Make sure that they are even.
 These two strands should start right above your ears. To feather, make sure that your scissors are very sharp. Open them and beginning at the length of the last section you cut, run the blade in short up and down strokes while ultimately traveling down the strand. Be sure never to close the scissors, they should be sharp enough to cut the hair in this way.
