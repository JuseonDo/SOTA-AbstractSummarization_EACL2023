 A good size for this is 3 blocks deep, 5 blocks wide and 5 blocks long. You should not make it too deep.
 It will follow you wherever you go. Lead it to a place around the trap.
 Move on to the next step quickly or the creeper will catch up with you.
 The creeper will continue to move towards you and fall into the hole.
 The creeper will stay where it is but all of the other mobs will go away, making the job much easier for you.
 The creeper will not blow up from where it is as it wouldn't hurt you because you are above it.
 You can build a staircase out if you need to, unlike the creeper.
