,, Make sure the brown cardboard side is the inside of the cylinder. Use clear packing tape on the inside to secure the two ends together.
 The brown cardboard side should be facing up.

Place the cylinder with the edges folded inwards on top of the top piece and adjust so that the edges all line up to the shape of the top piece.






Use clear packing tape on the brown cardboard side along the inside of the cylinder to secure it to the top piece.
 Take the brim of the hat and align it with the shape of the top.


Slide the brim all the way down the cylinder so that it sits on the bottom edge that is folded out.






Use clear packing tape on the bottom cardboard side to secure the brim to the cylinder all the way around.
 Make adjustments if necessary. Secure with more packing tape only on the inside if needed.
