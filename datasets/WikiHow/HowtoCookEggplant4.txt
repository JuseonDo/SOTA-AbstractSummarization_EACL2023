Eggplant can be cut in half, cut in chunks or made into a fan shape for baking.






Generally the peel is left on when the eggplant is halved to hold it together after cooking.






When eggplant is to be cut into pieces for a recipe it is generally peeled first.
 Lay the eggplant pieces in the pan, taking care not to overlap the pieces.
