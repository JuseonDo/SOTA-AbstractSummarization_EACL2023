 The sprouts mature from the bottom up and are at their sweetest when they are still small and tightly closed.


To encourage development of the upper sprouts, pinch out the growing tip of the Brussels sprouts plant in late summer. The Brussels sprouts will develop a sweeter flavor after a few light frosts.
 Pinch them off with your fingers or use a small knife to cut the buds off.


The sprouts form in the leaf axils (the point between where the leaf joins the stem) and can be harvested around 3 months after planting.
 Cut the stem a few inches below the bottom bud when the leaves on the plant start to turn yellow.


Store the sprouts in a cool dark place. Like most things sprouts taste best when they are fresh.
