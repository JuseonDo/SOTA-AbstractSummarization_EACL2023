, You can try having sex by the pool.
 This can increase the orgasm level of both men and women, especially when used in sensitive areas., This will get the partners excited to a good deal., Doing this in moderation makes the scene a sexy one. Note that some may find this uncomfortable, so ask for your partner's permission before starting off,, Try touching, massaging, licking or stimulating all the different parts of each others' body., Consider a rule stating that whoever wins the game gets to call the shots in bed, or play a game where for every one round that your partner loses, they must take off one piece of clothing at a time., Even if you end up laughing hysterically about how weird or impossible it is, you can go through a variety of positions of the Kama Sutra and try some of your own!, This is great during the foreplay as you can imagine and put yourselves in that story or film.
