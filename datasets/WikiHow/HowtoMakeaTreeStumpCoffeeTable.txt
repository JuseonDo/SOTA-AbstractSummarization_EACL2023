 The tree trunk should be at least 6 inches/15cm, or longer.;
, Use appropriate tools and safety precautions; if you're not sure what to do, ask someone who does to help out. Bring the stump home.
, You can use ordinary spray paint as well as standard acrylic or other craft/wood-suitable paint. Allow to dry completely before painting a second or even third coat.
 Alternatively, if you don't want the table to roll, you can use practically any feet for this project.
 Keep the distance between each of the wheels sufficient to ensure good balance.
