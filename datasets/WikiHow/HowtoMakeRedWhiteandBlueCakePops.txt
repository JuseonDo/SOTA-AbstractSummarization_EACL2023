, Combine the cake mix and the ingredients called for on the boxed instructions. Pour the batter in a greased cake pan and bake according to the instructions.
,,, Grab small pieces of the mixture and roll them into quarter-size balls. Place them on the baking sheets.
, Place the melts in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt for about 2-3 minutes, mixing with a spoon every few minutes to prevent scorching.
 Mix until the mixture runs off the spoon and is smooth.


If desired, you could separate the melted candy melt mixture into different bowls and add food coloring.
 If necessary, add a small amount of melted candy melt mixture on the tip of the lollipops sticks to help stick them in more easily.
 Gently twirl them around to get rid of any excess mixture. Place them on a cake pop holder., Garnish the cake pops with sprinkles and extra decorative frosting designs, if desired. Enjoy!


Feel free to make the cake pops as patriotic as you'd like. You could try making an American flag or a few fireworks using sprinkles and frosting.
