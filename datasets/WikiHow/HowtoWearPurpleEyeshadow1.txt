 A primer really helps eyeshadow to blend better and stay longer. When applying make sure to fully blend it out.;
, A light seashell color works best., Using your brush of choice pack the color directly onto the lid. It doesn't need to be super neat since you will be blending later.
 Use small circular motions and blend up and out to diffuse the color. Blending may take a little while but it's worth it to get the perfect eyeshadow look. You know you're done blending when there are no harsh lines and everything is smooth and your ideal smokiness.
 Blending can take some of the color away so you may need to use your first brush to apply more color to get your ideal level of opaqueness.
 You can use the same brush from before or a thinner one.
 Do the same thing as on the lid and blend out in small circular motions. Make sure to go easy on the blending. It is quite easy to overdo and look like a 12 year old emo kid., You can do any type of eyeliner you want. For example, you can simply tightline and line your water line to intensify the lash line. This is a good technique if you don't feel like doing winged liner for every look.
