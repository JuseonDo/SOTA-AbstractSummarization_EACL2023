 About 3 - 4 square foot is a good starting point.


Take into consideration the lighting, tripod, camera, and the other supporting hardware you will need.;
, If it's permanent, you have a lot more freedom with your design. You can do a lot more if you don't have to clean it up for dinner.
 You will need to try different angles for different subjects.
 They are a focusing rail, beanbag tripod, a vise, etc. Whatever it takes.
 That really applies to all types of studios.
 This is the opportunity to see what you can come up with. A little brainstorming, PVC, and a screwdriver and it's amazing what you can do.
