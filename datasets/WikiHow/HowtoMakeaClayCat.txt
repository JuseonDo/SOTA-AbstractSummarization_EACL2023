 Get the clay colors that speak to you when you envision the cat. Good choices might be brown, black, pink, red, and yellow clay. You will add interest by creating details with tools such as forks, plastic knives, garlic pressers, whatever your imagination brings forward. The varied textures and colors will make your creature eye-catching.;
, This will be the body. Roll the brown clay in a big ball. Then squeeze the top sides a little to create an egg-shaped body.


To add more detail to the belly, flatten a piece of pink clay into an egg shape, a bit smaller than the body. Then stick it on body for the stomach.
 Use something to keep it in place, such as a toothpick, when you stick it on top of the body.
 Put them next to each other on the bottom of the head (not all the way at the bottom). Add a very small ball under the cheeks in the middle.
, You don't really need to make a mouth though because the snout forms the mouth.
 Put some pink clay inside the holes and stick the ears on top of the head.
 You can also stick in string to make whiskers.
 Bend a little at the front to make paws. Add claws by pushing a line down on each paw with a toothpick three times. Stick them on the front of the clay cat.


Do the same method with the legs, but stick them in the back.
Add pads on the arms and legs to add more detail, but you don't have to if you don't want to.
