 This should be a welding machine, electrode and workpiece clamps (and their leads), a welding helmet darker than shade 10, welding gloves, and appropriate safety clothing.;
, This includes grinding down rough edges and cleaning the areas to be welded.
 Beveling allows for better penetration of the root pass and subsequent passes. Beveling can be done with an oxy-fuel torch or a plasma arc cutter, but isn't necessary on thinner metal.
 They should be smooth and align cleanly.
 This should be the flat side if on or more pieces are beveled, or the side you don't want to start welding.
 So, if you are going to use 100 amps to make your weld(s), set your amperage at 110 amps.
 These will hold the metal together and prevent it from warping or bending inward when the weld is finished. To make a tack weld, strike an arc and let it sit for a few seconds. A few tack welds are usually needed and you should be able to break them with a hammer or wrench.
, This is going to be the first and deepest pass on your weld, and if the metal is thick enough, the only pass you'll need. If you beveled the steel start at the bottom for your root pass. You need to ensure the root pass penetrates deeply enough, and for this reason 6010 electrodes are frequently used for this purpose.
 These passes should strengthen the weld and fill it in. Make sure to clean each pass before you start a new one.
