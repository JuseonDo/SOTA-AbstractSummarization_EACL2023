 For a standard ice shot glass, it's usual to just use water. However, you can get fancy here––try filling it with orange juice, cola or Gatorade for a colorful effect (see the third method below for layering). If you know the alcoholic drink you'll be serving, consider matching the colors (unless it's clear, in which case, anything goes). You could also consider using a virgin version of your favorite mixed drink, since the actual alcohol will go in the frozen glass.









If you want, you can put a lollipop or popsicle stick coming from the bottom of each glass. This will help your guests to take the shot without touching the glass, which may turn slightly sticky as it melts, depending on which liquid you used. If you do this, it's recommended to find lollipops with plastic over the candy, and let guests remove this plastic at their convenience, as this is the most hygienic.
, The shot glasses should pop right out, ready for immediate use.
 Obviously, only pour cold or chilled drinks into the glass, to avoid speeding up the melting process.
