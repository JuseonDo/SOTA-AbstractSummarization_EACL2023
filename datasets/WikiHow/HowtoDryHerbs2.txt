, A kitchen bench or the sink are ideal spots.


Alternatively, use a dish drying rack. Lay the tea towel on the rack; this will allow for greater air circulation.
 Use the least amount of water possible to avoid crushing or bruising the herbs. Perhaps lay herbs in a colander under running water, or just hold the herbs under the water. Finish with a gentle shake over the sink to dislodge as much of the water as possible.
 Lay across the tea towel if you have more than one. Try to prevent too much overlapping.
 Touch to feel if the herbs are dry. When the herbs are dry enough, use in the recipe as required.
