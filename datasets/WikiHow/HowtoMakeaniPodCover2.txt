 The length should be twice the length of the iPod plus a flap; the width should be the width plus twice the depth (i.e. distance from the front to the back of the iPod). Mark these measurements on your felt and cut.
 Fold up the bottom of the felt so that it covers most of the front of the iPod. Pin the felt into place nice and tight.
 Slip the iPod back in to make sure it fits snugly. Be careful not to scratch it with the pins.
 Snip the corners of the flap so that they are rounded.
, Turn the whole thing inside out.
, Take a snap and stitch the top half of the snap to the inside of the flap. Stitch the bottom half of the snap on to the top of the inside flap. Insert iPod.
