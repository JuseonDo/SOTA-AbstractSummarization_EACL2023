 The specifics will vary from community to community and platform to platform. Make sure you read the guidelines closely and ask questions of existing moderators if you have them.;
, Turn yourself into a vital and helpful part of the community. Make a positive impact. Also, meet the minimum amount of time required to be on the website. In many communities, minimum ranks/points must be met.
 You need to show your maturity. Make sure you have no recent warnings or bans.
 All answers/thoughts should be appropriate and have all work shown.
 Do not humiliate or embarrass users. Treat others the way that you would like to be treated. All users deserve respect. Even when you have to block, ban, or delete, judge the actions, not the users.
, Don't create uncertainty and keep it simple.
 Do not act as if you are better than everyone else. Everyone plays a great part of the learning environment.
 Take your time and try to understand the situation as best you can. Always do an action based on evidence, not opinions.
 Everyone makes mistakes and it's better to admit it.
 Do not give your friends/relatives extra credit.
 Use private messaging when possible and appropriate. Talking to users within the public arena can make them feel embarrassed or humiliated.
 Being a moderator is a privilege, not a right. Your status can be removed any time. Make sure you maintain high standards for your work, both in moderation and in regular use of the platform.
