 Trim the ends.
 Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise only if it is over eight inches (20 cm). Scoop out the mature seeds from the center.


If you are shredding a very large zucchini, cut it into fourths. Scoop seeds out of each section.
 Turn it so that it is on its side with the largest grating holes facing up., Run it lengthwise along the top of the grater to achieve long, spaghetti-like shreds. You can turn the zucchini horizontally to make smaller shreds.


Be very careful as you get closer to your hand. Reposition it frequently to avoid cutting yourself.
 Freeze or use the shredded zucchini.
