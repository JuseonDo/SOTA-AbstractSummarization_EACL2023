 Place your tree, stand and all, out in the yard. Be sure to remove the decorations! Birds will find the tree and use it as shelter during the winter months. In spring, once the birds donâ€™t need it anymore, either chip it up or lay it on its side in a part of your yard where it can serve as a brush pile for other backyard wildlife.;

Use them at the base of a fresh compost pile. Having coarser materials, like tree branches, at the bottom of the pile helps increase air flow to the pile.

Use them to mulch your beds or garden paths. Cut them up into smaller pieces first.
