, After you wash the potatoes, use a paper towel to cover them in non-fat cooking spray and place them on a baking tray. It should take 45-60 minutes to bake the potatoes. You can test them by poking them with a fork.
 Wait at least 10 minutes for them to cool down.
 Use a sturdy knife to do this.
 Use a big spoon to scrape out the insides of each potato wedge, leaving only a thin layer of potato over the skin.
 Place 1 tsp. chili powder, ½ tsp. salt, 1 tsp. olive oil, and ½ tsp Tabasco sauce in a small bowl. Stir the mixture until all of the ingredients are combined.
, Put them on the sheet in a single layer, so that they aren't touching.
, Bake the skins and the mixture until the potatoes and mixture are crisp and brown. Check in on the potatoes to make sure the cheese hasn't burned. It should take about 15 minutes for the skins to finish baking.
 Let the skins cool for at least five minutes.
 This will add a fresh and crunchy kick to the baked potato skins.
 Serve the skins with 1 tsp. of low-fat sour cream each.
