 Stone-free peaches are desirable but any peach will do.,, Wrap the peach in at least 2 layers of paper.
, Remove as much air as possible. Zip the bags shut.
, Take out a peach and unwrap it. Immediately put the peach under hot running water, rubbing its skin lightly. The skin will rub right off.
 Carefully slice the frozen peach down to the stone all the way around, gently twisting the blade from side to side to loosen the stone.
