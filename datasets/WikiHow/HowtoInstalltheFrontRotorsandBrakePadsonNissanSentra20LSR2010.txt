Make sure that car is securely up in the air and secure you can work on it.
You need to have your car in neutral with the key in. Do not take the key out of the car. Just leave the key in. The reason is that you will able to move the wheel to get a better working capability.
Open the hood and remove the brake reservoir cap, so that the pressure will get released when you pull the piston back.;

Hang caliper will secure brake hose from stretching.
While removing caliper, do not depress brake pedal because piston will pop out.
Do not damage piston boot.



The standard thickness of a new pads is 0.433 inches.
The repair limit thickness is 0.079 inches.
,,



CLZ25VB: The standard thickness of a new rotor is 0.945 inches, and its repair limit thickness is 0.866 inches.
CLZ25VJ: The standard thickness of a new rotor is 1.024 inches, and its repair limit thickness is 0.945 inches.
AD25V: The standard thickness of a new rotor is 1.102 inches, and its repair limit thickness is 1.024 inches.
Then their run-out limit is 0.0014 inches, and the maximum uneven wear (measure at 8 positions) is 0.0008 inches or less in all types of front rotors.

Proper care and way is needed while removing pad retainer from torque member, so as not to deform it.
Avoid it from bending while cleaning with wire brush

,



When installing pad retainer, attach it firmly so that it is not lifted up from torque member.
,



Wipe them with a clean rag and lubricate them

,


Spray Brake Cleaner over the surface area of rotor and wipe it with a clean rag.




Apply Molykote AS-88ON grease or equivalent to the shims.
Securely install shim to pads according to mounting direction of pads.



You could either use brake caliper wind back tool in order to compress caliper piston.
This is the reason that the brake reservoir cap should be opened.




Line up the caliper pins and tighten 14 mm lower caliper bolts (2) to 20 ft. lb using a torque wrench.




Give torque value of 80 ft.lbs.
