 There are two possible essential oils that are appropriate for use on a turmeric stain - either eucalyptus oil or lavender oil. Use whichever you can source most easily.;
,, Hang it out to dry, preferably in full sunlight.
 If you can still see the remnants of a stain (these will probably be pink), try the following to get rid of the last bit:


Cut a lemon in halves.






Rub one half of the cut lemon over the stain.






Return the clothing to the sunshine to dry and bleach.
