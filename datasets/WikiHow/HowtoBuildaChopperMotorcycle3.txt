Usually only advanced mechanics take on this option, as it entails a lot of time, resources and skill. Experienced chopper builders also understand what works or fits together and what doesn’t.



Look for a large motorcycle shop or even a junkyard that has a dedicated area for motorcycles as a starting point, both as a parts source and a place to turn to for advice.



Get mechanical assistance in building or rebuilding drivetrains, creating or modifying custom body parts and painting or plating bare metal.
