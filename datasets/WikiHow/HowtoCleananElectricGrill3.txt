 Right after you cook with your grill, unplug it and let it cool down for about five minutes., While the grill is still warm, lay two to three moistened paper towels on the bottom plate. How many paper towels you use will depend on how thick each one is. Use enough to be able to grab food particles without tearing them.
 Let the warm grill plates and damp paper towels steam clean the grill for about 1 minute or until the plates completely cool down. Any caked-on grease will loosen up.
 Use the damp paper towels or dampen a sponge with hot water and dish soap. Scrub the grill down until it’s squeaky clean.
 Make sure your grill is dry, especially around the plug, and wipe it down from top to bottom with a clean, dry dishcloth.
