If you're going alone, don't be embarrassed because there are other people - whether they're in your school or not - who end up going to the dance alone. This doesn't mean you're a loser or going to be "forever alone", but you may gain respect for some people are too afraid of showing up alone. If you came alone, you've proved to others - whether they realize or respect it or not - that you are brave and not afraid to be yourself.
