 If you control them and stop controlling others, you will more easily express your true and beautiful self and feel more free. For example, if someone says: you are stupid, don't be angry (angry means to insult back to them, or to fight to them, ...) It's his/her opinion, it may be right, but may also be wrong, just relax: okay, it's your opinion, you don't need to let it affect you, you have the power to choose the way you are!;
, Don't hide anything. This will not only make you feel better, it'd help you feel like you're not in another world. Don't lie!

, Don't stay inside all day with electronics: staring at your computer (playing runescape, going on Myspace, facebook, hi5, etc.), watching T.V., playing xbox, or just anything else none physical. Go out and enjoy Mother Nature as much as you can!

, Show some love. Call your friends, be there for them. Play with your pets, show them how much you care! It's never a bad thing to give happiness to another living soul.
 Help out at an animal shelter, help out with charity, ask for work from a friendly neighbor, know the people around you!

, Ride your bike around your neighborhood or just play around at the mall, walk at the park. Do things that suit you and your pals.
 Maybe shopping, going to the movies, baseball games, playing a sport, water parks, etc.
, Eat right! Don't eat out a lot, and maybe help your parents by cooking, or simply helping out in the kitchen. For a snack that is easy and refreshing have a plate of fruits, ham or turkey, crackers, carrots, cucumbers, etc. together with water or juice. It's easy to prepare and good to eat, as well as have the benefits of help make you healthy.
 Appreciate what you have in life!

, As Bobby McFerrin's "Don't worry, be happy" song lyrics stated, "in this life we have some troubles, but if you worry you make it double, so don't worry."
