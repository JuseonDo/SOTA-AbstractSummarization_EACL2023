 This bypass won't work on iPhones running iOS 9.3 and up; downgrading your iOS version is possible if you're willing to jailbreak your iPhone, but be aware that doing so will void your warranty with Apple.;
, This method doesn't disable your passcode, so you'll still need to perform an iPhone restore to remove the passcode permanently.
 This will activate Siri.
 This should bring up a clock icon with your local time.Siri responds to "What time is it?" better than other inquisitions (e.g., "Would you tell me the time?", etc.).
 This will take you to your World Clock menu.
 This is in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.
 The search bar is at the top of your screen. These characters don't need to mean anything--you just need to be able to select them for copying.
 This should highlight the text.
 This will copy the selected text, making it available for pasting later.
 This will open a menu with various share options.
 This will open a new message window.
 The "To" field is at the top of your screen.
 This will minimize the iMessage window, taking you directly to your home screen. You have successfully bypassed the lock screen on iOS 9.2.1!
