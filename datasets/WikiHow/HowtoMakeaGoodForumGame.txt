 Even though you do have the Internet and are reading this, let's say there aren't people with Internet. A forum online requires this.;
,, This may sound simple, and sometimes it is. Look into how the greatest threads on the web go on for long periods of time. See how they have a topic interesting enough to encourage people to always want to continue posting.
 You don't want to steal other people's ideas, no matter how good they are. Sit down and think of the research you did.
 Ask yourself, "Should my game be about...or maybe...but this also sounds good...." Just sit and think about it for as long as necessary.
 Don't be afraid if it won't be good enough or if it's too stupid to talk about. Just think to yourself, "Did this person get scared posting to this popular thread? Was this person shy when they posted this little?" Stay inspired in your idea and let it be free for people to explore.
 In games, others like to participate, and in gossip, people never post quadruple posts, just long ones. But don't just abandon it! At least keep it alive by posting on it every so often so people know you still like your thread. Be careful not to abandon it.
 Most of the time, people never get committed to a forum for very long periods of time. Some forums can last for years, and they have. But it will eventually be in the past and you have to move on. So be thinking of the next big game for all to enjoy, despite its lifespan.
