 The drawers are usually organized by number of drawings. Each drawing is designated its own number.;
, There is a black switch on the left side of the machine that you click for it to turn on. This machine usually takes anywhere from five to ten minutes to warm up. You will know that the machine is ready to be used once the button goes from orange to green., This setting makes it easier to see once the paper is printed out.
 If you print out the drawing and it is not clear again, simply adjust the settings again and print again. This might take a couple of attempts to get right., Hit scan to mailbox and proceed to scan the documents one by one. You are not able to scan more than one document at a time., By default, the scanner prints out a 18x24 sized paper. This will most likely because your size.
, This is where the scanner sends all the documents. Once in this folder, you copy and paste all the photos into your properly named folder., After opening up this tool you hit file and attach, then proceed to attach the document you wish to convert.
 One would be the Microstation file with the extension .dgn and the other being the file within the raster master with extension .cit., You can use the 'Measure Length' tool to make sure the sizes are correct., You could do this by simply using the 'Erase' tool., If so, hit save settings and also hit save. You have now converted an aperture scan into a Microstation document.
 If this happens, simply grab another card and push in the one that is stuck. This will fix your problem.






Sizes do not correlate. The biggest reason that your sizes do not correlate is because of your scale setting. You could change this scale setting under 'References'.
