If you're working with any fruits (banana or avocado), lots of honey, and other natural ingredients, it's better if they're well blended. Cut up fruits like bananas so they blend well.

, Moisture will penetrate your hair better, and you hair will retain more water, when it's wet. You can also wash your hair if you like, but you may need to rewash after the treatment., Combing it out is good if your hair is not tangled, but if it is, leave it be. You may want to section your hair so that you ensure that the treatment reaches everywhere.
, You can use a heated shower cap, use your blow-dryer to heat up your hair or warm up a towel in the dryer. Just make sure to heat up your hair--this also helps the moisture penetrate the hair shaft better.
 This will help retain the heat.
