 Dice the apple into small cubes and slice the orange and lemon into thin slices., Mix together all of the alcohol and other liquid ingredients in a large, clean punch bowl until they're fully incorporated. Use a large stirring spoon to combine the ingredients.
 Place the sliced fruit in the punch at least 4-5 hours before you'll serve it so it absorbs and flavors the alcohol. Mix the fruit around a bit to combine the ingredients.
 Use a large ladle to serve the jungle juice in clear plastic cups or Solo cups. Do not just dip each cup into the punch -- make sure to use something to pour the juice into the cups to keep things sanitary.
