 Many believe that since bamboo is drought-tolerant, little water is necessary for the plant. A bamboo plant is unsuccessful if it is not watered enough at first.


The unfortunate experience of killing a bamboo plant occurs within the first year. The lack of water is too much for a plant attempting to establish in a new location. Many bamboo plants are tended in the highest of quality of facilities before they are purchased, and they need time to adjust to a location that is different from their original place of origin.;
, This frequent watering should occur for the first 3 to 6 months when bamboo is being established at a new location.


Drier locations will need much more frequent watering.
Climates with more moisture are going to require less water.
Variations in watering may transpire with different soil types.
 Weather conditions may alter the amount of watering necessary from day to day and week to week.
 It is recommended to layer 2 inch (5.08 cm) to 3 inch (7.62 cm) of mulch to keep moisture contained so that the bamboo plant can be established. Mulch is an ideal climate control for anyone uncomfortable or uncertain when to water the plant.



If the soil is dry just below the surface in the spring or summer, the plant needs watering immediately. The soil should be moist at all times at this time because days are longer and temperatures are warmer.
In the winter, the soil can be drier. Temperatures are cooler and days are longer so the plant does not need as much water as compared to the spring and summer time.



The plant should be watered thoroughly. The spill of excess water will drain through the drain holes and collect in a saucer or tray below the pot.
 Because it is drought-tolerate, it can be harmed just as easily from over watering bamboo. The removal of excess water ensures the plant is receiving the necessary amount of water but is also not being drowned.
 As a plant becomes deprived of water, the leaves begin to roll up.
