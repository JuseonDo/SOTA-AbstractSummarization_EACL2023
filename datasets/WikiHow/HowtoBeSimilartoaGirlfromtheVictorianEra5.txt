 A Victorian girl is mannered, smart, poised, and simply just nice.
 This helps you achieve your "poised" goal.
 Always say, "Please" and "Thank you" along with other mannered phrases.
 Even if that person isn't particularly nice to you, go out of your way to be nice to everyone.
 Take the time to take notes in EVERY subject.
 You can't be poised without being organized.
 If you are rewarded, take your reward with modesty.
