 Use a Plexiglass cutter to cut through the glue at the seam of the ball. Pry it open with a screwdriver, but be careful. Inside the ball is a cylinder with blue-dyed water and the 20-sided ball of answers in it. Remove the three screws that hold the cylinder to the ball, then pour out and save the blue water in a small, open container. But be careful because it stains.
, You can write 20 answers, whatever you want., Use a turkey baster with an injector tip to put the blue dye back in. Put the ball back inside once the letters are completely dry. Glue the cap on with super glue.,,
