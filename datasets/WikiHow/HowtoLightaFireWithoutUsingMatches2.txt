 It requires a sunny day in order to start.


The sun goes from east to west. This means it will be optimal to light if you held the magnifying glass according to the time of day. In the morning, you should hold it when sitting to the east - while in the afternoon, you should hold it when sitting to the west.
,, Move the magnifying glass up/down until the beam of light becomes a concentrated point.
, If not, your tinder may be too wet, or the sun might not be fully out.
 Increase the stick size (diameter, mostly) every 2-3 minutes, until you have a full fire.
