 This drink works best when the container and the ice cream are at their coldest possible.;
, The ice cream doesn't have to be anything special––the affogato tastes brilliant on its own. But it must be very cold for this work well.
 Pour it right over the ice cream.


Alternatively, place the ice cream in the cup and the double shot of espresso in a shot glass, side by side, in front of your guest. They can help themselves to the pouring fun.
 While optional, this can make if fancier. As a topping you could use:


Ground vanilla
Sprinkles
Sugar

Or, one shot of liqueur.
 Enjoy the rush of heat and cold combined. Delicious!
