 Onion always goes well with browned beef and garlic is often a good idea as well, not to mention salt and black pepper.;
, One is enough, though a mix can be exciting, too. Mushrooms are good accompaniments to vegetables. Make sure the vegetables are well-thawed.
 A can of cream of celery or mushroom soup works well and you can add it directly to the browned beef and vegetables. If the sauce is being made from a powder, follow the given directions and allow the sauce to become very thick.
 Mix well and spread them evenly across the pan.
, Plan on the dish cooking in the oven for about 1 hour. Check on the dish after about 30 minutes.
