 Mystery candies are egg-shaped pieces of candies labeled with question marks that leave behind random mystery items when cleared. Mystery items can either be helpful in the form of wrapped candies, striped candies, and color bombs, or can hinder your gameplay in the form of licorice blockers, chocolate, or layered meringues.

While you may be tempted to make a striped candy whenever you see the opportunity, check to see if there are opportunities to make wrapped candies, first., This can help prevent you from accidentally detonating other nearby wrapped candies after matching wrapped + striped.
