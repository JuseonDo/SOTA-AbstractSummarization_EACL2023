 One multi-purpose green cleaner is ionized acidic water from a water ionizer. When made at 2.7 pH, ionized acidic water has been lab tested and proven to kill E.choli and staph bacteria on contact. It is safe and effective on countertops, cutting boards, floors, glass, toilets, door handles and even on skin so no gloves or masks are needed. You can make it for pennies on the gallon by hooking a water ionizer up to your tap and filling a plastic spray bottle with it.
