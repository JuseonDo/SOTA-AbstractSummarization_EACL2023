,,, Bend a small V shape on both ends.
 Make sure the rubber band is stretched tautly across the gap between the 2 ends. This is your string.
, Take some straws and cut off the bendy part if it has one. Cut a small slit through both sides of one end using scissors. This slit will hold the straw on the rubber band. Wrap some tape around the end without the slit. This will make it go farther and faster, because of the weight in the front.
 Lock the arrows, pull back the frame, and let go for some big fun in a small package!.
