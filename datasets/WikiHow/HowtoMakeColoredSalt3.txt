 You should find it dries instantly and won't leave any liquid, which may be the case with liquid food coloring.
, Transfer the gel using an implement such as a wooden or metallic skewer tip, the end of a butter knife or a toothpick. Only use a small amount at a time, adding a little more if you're not yet satisfied with the color. Gel coloring is fairly vibrant with just a little amount, so you don't want to overdo it.
 Seal tightly.
 Ensure that all of the salt is evenly colored.
 Given that this is gel, the colored salt should be ready to use immediately.


If not using it straight away, you can leave it stored in the sealed bag.
Repeat the process for as many colors as desired.
