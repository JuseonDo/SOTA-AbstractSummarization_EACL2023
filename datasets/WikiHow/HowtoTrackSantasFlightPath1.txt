 Depending on your location, the flight may start very early on in the day (Eastern Time) on Christmas Eve, or go into the morning/mid-afternoon hours on Christmas Day. If you are dying to see his full flight path, be prepared to stay awake from about 2:00AM Eastern Standard Time till Christmas day.
