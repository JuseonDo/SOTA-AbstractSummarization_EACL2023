 You need something to hold your kit! But make sure it is big enough to hold pads and, if you use them, tampons.;
, Usually, your first period is very light and just spotting, so pantyliners are perfect. For a heavier flow, you'll want pads or tampons. Alternatives are menstrual/soft cups or reusable, cloth pads. You'll need about 3 liners and 3 pads or tampons to last you through a work or school day. Be sure to change every 4-6 hours.
 There's a high possibility you'll get period cramps, which aren't pleasant. Ibuprofen works well to reduce the pain; if you're really hurting badly, you can take up to four at a time as long as you don't exceed the daily limit listed on the label.
 If you're unsure of when exactly your period is, write down the date every month until you find your pattern.
 Extra underwear can be helpful, especially if you stain your current pair of undies. In this case, you'll want a Ziploc bag to hold your stained underwear.
 (If this is a regular problem, consider wearing both a pad and a tampon, changing your product to something that doesn't leak, or taking birth control for lighter periods.)

, It always helps when the bathroom's out of soap!

, Make sure that they are biodegradable and not scented.
 A plastic baggy can also be useful for if there is not a place to dispose of a used tampon or pad (on a hike, at the beach, etc.)

,, The chemicals in chocolate can help with your cramps and satisfy that craving you're probably having.
