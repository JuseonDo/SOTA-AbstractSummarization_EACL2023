 Try to use whole milk. It will be more exfoliating and moisturizing than low-fat or nonfat milk., Honey is also antibacterial, and great at reducing acne.
 If necessary, open the jar, and stir the milk and honey with a spoon. You want the honey to dissolve in the milk, and not settle at the bottom.
 Avoid using water that is too hot, or it will destroy the beneficial properties of the honey.
 Once the tub is ful to your liking, turn the water off, and swish it with your hand to combine the milk-and-honey mixture.
 Do not use any soap in this bath. When you are done soaking, drain the bath water, and rinse yourself off using soap and fresh water.
