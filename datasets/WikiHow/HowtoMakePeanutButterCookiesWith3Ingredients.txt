, A wooden spoon with a sturdy handle is a good idea, since it will help you mix the dough into a uniform consistency. Be careful though - you don't want to over-mix the dough!

You can spray the sheet with cooking spray or brush it with oil.
Two soup spoons or teaspoons can be used to drop round blobs of about the right size onto a cookie sheet fairly quickly.
Leave a couple inches between adjacent cookies and don't pack them together too closely. They will tend to spread out somewhat as they bake, and it helps them to bake evenly if there's space in between.
 This achieves that crisscross pattern characteristic of peanut butter cookies. If you don't do this, the balls will still spread into a cookie shape, but you won't have the pattern on top.
