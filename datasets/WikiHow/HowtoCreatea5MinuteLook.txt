 If you don't have time buy some oil blotting sheets from Walgreen's or another drugstore and use those.
 Make sure it matches you skin tone. Dab concealer on any prominent blackheads or red spots. Make a little stripe right under the eye and spread the concealer in.
 Put a thin line of matte white powder down the center of your nose to make it look thinner. Make a fish face and put bronzer in the hollow of you cheeks and sweep downwards.
 Put blush on the apples of your cheeks and sweep to your temples. Depending on your face shape, you could just keep it on your apples of your cheeks.
 Grab a small but fluffy brush and cover your lids in bronzer, and put blush in the crease.
 This step is optional. Add shimmer on the tear sac, brow bone, and add a bronzer right under the cheekbones for a defined cheek bone.
