How you organize your writing submissions with binders will depend on the type and length of your writing endeavors. Tailor the following system to your situation.
Standard binders are approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm). For larger, multi-volume submissions, you may need larger binders. For durability, choose vinyl or non-paper binders.;
,,, Depending on your specific kind of writing, these subsections can include agents, magazines, online publications, current clients, potential clients, and/or publishing houses.
 The dossier should include the most current contact information and detailed guidelines for submissions, queries, or completed projects. Technical writers should also include any stylistic guidelines specific to their clients.



Keep the queries, submissions, writing samples, or completed projects in this binder ordered chronologically. Anything with an upcoming deadline should appear first in the binder.
 On the first of every month, rearrange so the current month is the first month seen when the binder is opened.



The contents of this folder should be clearly marked with the date of submission as well as the anticipated waiting period for a response. If the client said responses would be issued in 6 to 8 weeks, wait 8 weeks until sending a follow-up. Refer to your binder of publishing house dossiers to remind yourself of specific waiting periods.
If a publisher, magazine, agent, or client has rejected your submission, query, or project, keep the rejection slip. If you submit a new piece at a later date, refer to any suggestions or hints they offered for future success.
Keeping rejection slips serves as a reminder not to send multiple submissions to the same company.
