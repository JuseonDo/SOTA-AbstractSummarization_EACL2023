 If you'd like to make more colors or flavors, you will need to make separate batches.
 If the petroleum jelly is not fully-melted, microwave it for another 15 to 30 seconds, and stir it again. Keep microwaving and stirring the petroleum jelly until it is completely melted., The flavor will also be stronger. You can use any type of mix you like, but berry-flavored ones will give you the typical pink color. You can also try mixing different drinks together to create a "fruit punch" type flavor. Be mindful of the colors, however.
 You can find empty containers in the paint section of an art store; they are used for storing extra paint, and make great lip gloss containers. You can also use empty lip gloss containers, clean contact lens cases, and pill boxes as well.
 If you are in a hurry, you can put it into the fridge for a few hours. As it cools, it will harden and become more solid. You can apply it using your finger or a q-tip.
