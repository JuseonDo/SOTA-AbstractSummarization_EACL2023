 Processed foods contain salt not only for flavoring, but also as a preservative.


Processed foods include canned soups, processed lunch meat, frozen items and even canned vegetables.;
, Stick to fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Make your own salad dressing, too.


If you think you've eaten too much salt, consume fruits and vegetables that are high in potassium to balance it out. Foods high in potassium include apricots, avocado, bananas, milk, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, kiwi fruit, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes.



A food with less than 5 milligrams of sodium is considered sodium-free. A good guide is to aim for less than 140 milligrams per serving. Pay attention to serving size, too, as that can alter your sodium intake.
Choose fat-free or low-fat dairy products. Not only do they contain less sodium, but also less fat.
Stay away from smoked or salted fish. Choose fish that are packed in water, or fresh fish if it's available.
, Leave salt out of everything you prepare yourself.


Season vegetables with vinegar or lemon juice. Or, add flavorful vegetables like onions and peppers to low-fat meats.
If you feel you must salt food while cooking, add it at the end because you will need less. The salt flavor leaves the food the longer it cooks and becomes less noticeable.
