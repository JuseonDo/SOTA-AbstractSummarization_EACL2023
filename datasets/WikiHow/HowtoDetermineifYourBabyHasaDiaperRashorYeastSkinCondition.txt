 Most diaper rashes will go away without treatment, however, don't let it linger on for too long.;
, Look for a color inconsistency or rash. if the rash is patchy red, it is a diaper rash. If the rash is red, raised and is located in a patchy area with sharp jagged borders, and also contains spots in the diaper area, this rash is not a generic diaper rash, but is a yeast infection.
 If the rash is rash covers the entire genital area, it almost certainly is a diaper rash as well.
 If the rash is the result of antibiotics and is located around the genitals or a larger area (such as located around the baby's buttocks) this rash is the result of a yeast infection/rash.
 If you notice a smell, this is indeed a yeast infection. Only yeast infections have a foul smell that can linger on if not treated in time.
 This is a classic sign of a yeast infection.
 These are signs of a yeast infection too.
