 This is what will become your snowflake. White coffee filters will yield the most colorful results.;
,,,, This is similar to typical regular paper snowflakes. It can be as simple or as complex as you want. Cutting triangles tend to be easiest, but rounded shapes are possible too.
 It should have a repeating pattern around it.
 These have to be the washable kind, which are water based.


Your coloring does not have to be neat; the design will spread and blur into colored blobs.
 The longer it is submerged, the more blurred the colors will get. It only needs to be submerged for a second or two.


Alternatively, you could use a spray bottle and spray water on the snowflake. This will result in a less blurred, more colorful snowflake. It also may be a little less messy when working with children, as they tend to slop water everywhere.
, Be gentle, as wet filters tear easily.
 Alternatively, you can simply stick it wet on a window and it will hang there until it dries and falls off. Enjoy!

, A good project with young children is worth repeating. With a few variations, this project can be done again to easily fit another theme. For example:


Do not cut the paper filter - just "tie-dye" it. Just by itself it is pretty. It also creates a nice "stained glass" effect which is nice for a unit on the Middle Ages.
You could also create a flower. Again, skip the cutting steps. When dry, add a green chenille stick and paper leaf. Give the paper a small twist to create a flower!
