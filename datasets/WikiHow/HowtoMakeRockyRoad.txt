, Leave spaces between the marshmallows and the sides of the dish.
,, Heat gently to melt. Stir regularly.
 Pay extra attention to the sides around the marshmallows and fill these with chocolate. Also take the chocolate to the edge of the dish. If you're not sure that the chocolate is filling the cracks, ease it in a little using a teaspoon. The melted chocolate acts as the "binder" for the rocky road, so it needs to cover the ingredients well.
 Leave for several hours, or overnight. If you are leaving it in overnight, cover to prevent odor transfer.
 It may need levering using a knife and be prepared for some of the coconut to come spilling out. Break the rocky road into uneven pieces. The more uneven the better, as this is the traditional "shape" for rocky road. Place onto a serving plate or store in an airtight container. If your kitchen is warm, keep refrigerated.
