 Try to get them as close together as possible, while leaving a space slightly wider than your body between them. If other people are using these weight benches, you will need to move them back immediately after you are finished.If you canâ€™t find two weight benches, two very sturdy chairs can work. Make sure they are heavy and stable enough to support your weight.
If you have injured wrists, avoid bench dips. Use the assisted dip machine until you are able to do the dip without a counterbalance.
 Bend your knees, keeping them in a low bend and wide angle to the ground. Make sure you are wearing athletic shoes with good traction.
