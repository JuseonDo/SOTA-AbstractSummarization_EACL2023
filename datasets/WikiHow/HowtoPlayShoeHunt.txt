search for the shoes.
@article
 If preferred, print them from photos online - here is a good place to start looking. Glue onto thin cardboard to strengthen them, as they will be played with a lot by the participants. There must be a pair of shoes because part of the game is not only finding the hidden shoes but pairing them up as well.;
, Put them high and low, behind pictures, under mats, behind the sofa etc.
 The girl or boy finding the greatest number of shoes that prove to be pairs receives a prize.
