 The barrel portion should be at least 24 inches (61.0 cm), but advanced users are encouraged to try various lengths and observe the results.;
, This will be the ignition chamber end of the gun.
 One nail should go on one side, and the other directly across on the opposite side of the chamber. There should be around ¼ in of space between the two nail tips.
 This is most easily accomplished by stripping a section of each wire and then tightly winding the wire around each of your contact points, in this case two nails. Remember, one wire per nail.
 To do this, remove the end cap and watch the nails for a spark when you press the ignition button. If you see the spark, you’re ready to start shooting.



Warning: Be ready to fire right away after loading and preparing the gun. Leaving the gun loaded for longer periods of time increases the chance for accident and injury.

Warning: Make sure the cannon is not pointed towards any people! Have a set target in mind and know what is around it.
