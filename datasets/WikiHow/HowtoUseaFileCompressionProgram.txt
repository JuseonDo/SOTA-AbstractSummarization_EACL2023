Utility-based compression: This type of file compression is standard with all PCs. The built-in utility program primarily performs what is known as file-to-file compression. It takes a single file—or multiple files—and compacts it into an “archive” file. A decompression program, such as Win Zip, must then be used to unpack the new file. Downloaded software programs and big files are compressed in this manner.

Operating-system compression: Some computer operating systems—mainly those that are incompatible with DOS’s FAT (file evaluation table) file system and most Windows systems—compress individual files within that particular operating system. Windows Vista, for example, will support this file compression system when the operator uses the Vista file system. This utility is favored because it unpacks compressed files automatically as needed while allowing the user to determine what files are “zipped.”

Volume compression system: Newer computer operating systems can compress entire hard drives by using a built-in file compression utility or a third-party product. This type of file compression system enables the user to conserve hard disc space without having to compress files one at a time. Packed files are automatically unpacked whenever a software application attempts to open them.;
