@summary
use a one subject spiral notebook to write your notes.
@article
, Instead of using individual pages, just pass the notebook.


A spiral notebook can look like you are sharing notes about the class.
It doesn't tempt others to read or intercept it.
It's bigger so passing it long distances isn't wise.
It's easy to pass to someone sitting close. It doesn't scream "note".
