here's a simple solution, that's been used for more than a century.

@summary
stir it up and then apply a small amount to each bite.

@summary
make sure to have three or four salt granules right on top of the bite.
@article
 Take a partial jar of Vicks Vaporub, add a couple of tablespoons of regular table salt to it.
 The purpose of the Vicks is to hold the salt granules in place, and the menthol alleviates the itching.
 Put it on when you go to bed, and when you wake up the swelling is down, it no longer itches and the chigger is dead and gone. If you have any residual inflammation, apply it again the second night. That 1/4 full or less jar of Vicks that you added salt to? It'll last you 10 to 20 years.
