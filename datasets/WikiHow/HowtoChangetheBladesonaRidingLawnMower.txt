 If the blades are not significantly worn but are dull, they may only require sharpening. If, on the other hand, the airfoil built into the back of the blade is worn away, or the blade is bent or otherwise damaged, you probably need to replace it.
 Turn it off and lock the brakes or chock the wheels. Disconnect spark plug(s).,, You need to make sure it is supported solidly, as riding lawn mowers are heavy, and you don't want to risk having it fall on you while you work on it. For greater safety, consider using a manufactured mower or tractor lift., You may also need a cheater pipe or other means of keeping the blade from turning while you remove the nut., For blades that are tightly seated, you may have to pry the blade off or work it up and down to loosen it after the nut is removed., Choose new blades to suit your own preferences â€“ there are a number of different blades for each type mower, including enhanced discharging blades, mulching blades, and heavy duty blades., Since there are many different brands and manufacturers of riding lawn mowers, making sure the blades you purchase fit your mower is critical for a successful project., Be sure to install the blade right side up, as they may fit upside down.
