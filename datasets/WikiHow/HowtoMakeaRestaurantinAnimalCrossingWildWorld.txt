 If you want, you can get more than one room. It all depends on your style. Customer service is more important than space, anyway.;
, You'll need tons of native fruit to sell to your customers, who, hopefully, don't have your native fruit at their town.
 You also need space to store reserves and extras. Find one that compliments your restaurant's theme.
 Tons! Small ones to form a bar like The Roost or for 1 or 2 person tables. Big ones for 4 person tables. Combine tables to make bigger seats. Try to match tables!

, Bar stools for the bar and matching chairs for the other tables. !IMPORTANT! Only fill up the two opposite sides of the table. No more!

, Make people come to your restaurant. Maybe you could also offer furniture in a separate room for 1/2 off (make sure it's stuff you got free but don't want). Maybe instead of payment, you could also trade for another item. Be original!

, If you can sell it for, say, 100 bells, and they can sell it for, say, 500 bells, sell it for 300 bells.
 This is optional, but if you have a large house with many rooms, it may help. you must pay them if you want to be fair.
 Hurry before the lunch rush!

, Post, open your gates, and wait. Soon you may have every table full.
, use 'em on special occasions or when you get rare stuff for free! It rakes in customers!

, It fills unwanted space while you get orders. Try peppy or popular music!
