@summary
in tier three, shadow flame and lightning strike are the two skills you should consider upgrading first.

 They are both short recast skills (10 seconds or less), so you will be using them a lot, and that makes them ideal options for upgrading.


Shadow Lunge is another strong option, as it’s the hardest-hitting skill in this tier.
