Do not strain your voice or sing raspily. Those methods can actually harm or ruin your voice when done harshly or for too long at one time.
Sing out. Singing "under your voice" may not sound like you, or may sound weak or choked down.

Project your voice when singing which includes breathing deeply. Of course, to Sing Into a Microphone you must learn to hold it properly and closely enough for different purposes.

Build up more breath control so that you may sing louder without straining.
 If you want to form a group practice together, and you need people who not only can sang but are willing to work in order to do it right...


You may need to repeat the song 10 (or up to 20) times to learn it thoroughly.
