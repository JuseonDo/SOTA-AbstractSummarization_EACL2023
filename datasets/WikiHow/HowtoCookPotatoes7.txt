 Peel and cut into quarters.


You can leave unpeeled if preferred, provided they're well washed.
 Drain in a wire sieve, shaking a little to rough up the edges.
 Add the parboiled potatoes and stir to coat with oil.


If you like flavor, a little rosemary can be added now too.
 For the best crispiness, turn once or twice during cooking, taking great care not to splash yourself with the hot fat.
