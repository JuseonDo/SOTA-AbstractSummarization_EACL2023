If it calls for thyme sprigs, your washed thyme is ready to use.
If the recipe calls for thyme leaves, pull the sprigs through the tines of a fork to remove the leaves.
If the recipe calls for chopped fresh thyme, place the leafy stems on a clean chopping board and dice them into bits with a sharp knife. Remove any large, woody pieces of stem and discard.
