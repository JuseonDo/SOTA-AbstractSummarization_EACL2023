 The elimination of passive mobs is unnecessary.
 They should all connect.
 This could also be the first rail, your choice.
 Place it facing the rails. It is here now, but will be moved.
 One of these pieces is a critical piece.
 These from now on are marker blocks.
 A rail will become a corner. This is the first critical step.
 No other blocks can be in the way of this step. This Redstone is very important.
 Place it on the bottom lamp "Pointing" to the corner piece. This is your other critical step.
 When you do, the wire will light up and the track will switch for a few seconds.
