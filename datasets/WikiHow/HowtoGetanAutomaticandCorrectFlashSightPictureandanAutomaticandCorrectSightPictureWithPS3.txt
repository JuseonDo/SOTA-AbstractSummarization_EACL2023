there will be no need to take the time to find and focus on the sights, and then check and adjust as needed for a correct flash sight picture, and then shoot, because you will already have a correct flash sight picture.

if by some happy chance, you can see and focus on the sights, you can still use them if you wish to, and have the time to do that.

 P&S calls for placing the index finger along the side of the gun and using it to aim with by pointing it at a target, and pulling the trigger with the middle finger.


When the index finger is extended along the side of a gun, the barrel and sights will be in parallel with it, and the sights will be in proper alignment. And they will stay in that proper alignment for each shot, as long as the index finger is along the side of the gun and in parallel with them.
 Also, extending the index finger along the side of the gun, helps to naturally "lock up" the wrist, strengthen the grip, and improve recoil control.
