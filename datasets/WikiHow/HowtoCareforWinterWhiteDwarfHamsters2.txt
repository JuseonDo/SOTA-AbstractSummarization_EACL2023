if you try to pet your winter white and it squeaks or hisses at you, this is a sign that means: 'i'm scared' or leave me alone.

 If you do, it may cause stress. Stress can sometimes kill your hamster. After 2 or 4 days, you can start talking to your hamster and start to pet it.
 If that happens, leave your hamster alone for a while longer. Also, be careful when you're around your hamster and don't make any loud noises that may cause stress.
