 Use one that has a concertina or bendable part in it (see the images below).
 Cut so that the cut part includes the bendable part of the straw and measures 13.5cm in total.
 Do this with the screw and keeping it inside, bend the shorter straw end around to touch onto the other side of the straw. Then fix the bent over straw piece in place with adhesive tape so that the bend cannot unwind.
 Then make a hole in the bent part of the straw, at what will become the "front" of the slingshot (see the image). This is where the projectile will shoot out from.
 Do this using a wooden stick or skewer (this is also the projectile); the hole should accommodate its width. Remember to put the screw back in the first hole that you made (see the image). The screw will help to hold the rubber band in place.
,, When you reach for the rubber band, simply hold and pull the rubber band together with the stick.Hold in place.
 Let go of the band and the stick and the projectile will fly. Be careful where you aim it at so as not to hurt any living being or break anything precious.
