 If you can't find live native speakers to eavesdrop on, watch movies and television shows in that language, or listen to books on tape or music in that language.;
,, Try to learn new words and phrases every day. It is also crucial to frequently practice the earlier words you have learned, in addition to newer words. If possible, practice with native speakers, and encourage them to correct you.
,,,, Grammar books try to explain the rules of the language. The sentence 'This that same is' consists of English words, but isn't grammatically correct.


Make strong efforts to improve and remember specific grammar rules, so as to avoid incomprehensibility or vagueness to native speakers. 'Thinking' in the other language will also become easier and more frequent.
People who speak only one language often assume that the rules of their own language apply to all languages, or that these rules are almost the same everywhere. This is not the case at all. Learning a language requires more effort and commitment than just learning lots of foreign words.
Crash courses often try to play down the importance of studying the grammar. Attempt to opt for a foreign language class, where the teacher may be more adept in helping you better understand grammar rules on a personal and more efficient level.
 Based on vocabulary you have learnt, attempt to translate or at the very least, get a gist of the contents' meaning or aim.
, Guess the meaning based on the context, visual or auditorial clues before looking them up in a dictionary.
 This could range from a short sentence summing up your day, to a full-page diary entry or article.
, Sometimes the written version of the language is radically different than the spoken version.
