, You will then awaken in the Crimson Room. While facing the ceiling, click toward the bottom of the game window to look down. You should now be facing a blue door and a yellow chest of drawers holding various items.
 Take the thin ring inside of it.
 In the drawer on the upper-left, you will find a CD, and in the other a memo.
 You will find a cassette tape.
 If you click on the curtain, it will open. On the windowsill you will find a small silver key.
 After about five times, a thick ring will fall, which you will collect.
, When you lift it, you will find a small silver key underneath.
 Click in the very middle of the headboard, and you'll discover an odd metal stick.
 You'll need to click at the bottom-left corner. If you click in the right spot, you will find a blue battery at the foot of the bed.
, The gold fits into the right drawer, and the silver into the left. In the right drawer, you will find a power cord. In the left, you'll discover an odd red box.
 Press the power button to turn the stereo on and collect the key from the CD slot.
 Notice the strange slots on its top. In these slots, you can insert the metal stick and the two rings. The box will now open.
 Click on the box.
 You will notice that toward the end of the video, a "+" appears on the screen. The dancing man stops dancing to point to this spot. While he does this, move your mouse onto the spot.
 A rectangular slot should appear on the wall, and it opens to reveal a safe.
,, The table has four cards on it. Turn them over and they will reveal the code for the safe. (Note: The numbers on the cards are different every time you play. Additionally, 1994 will always work as the code.)

,,, You've escaped The Crimson Room!
