 There are so many publishing houses with affordable plays to perform. There is Dramaticpublishing.com, Samuelfrench.com, MTI.com, Broadwayjunior.com, etc.;
, It is a good idea to cast understudies or doubles for major parts.
 This task can be handled by one or several people. Most Directors can choreograph. Musical directors who teach the songs and harmonies to the children usually specialize in just this.
, You may be able to use the church or community center you held auditions at and just pay them a small fee.
 You can find qualified Stage Managers by placing a free ad on Craigslist under gigs or advertising in the free section of any popular theater magazine.
 This job can easily be done by a volunteer parent or two. Again, Craigslist is a wonderful source.
 Sets do not need to be too extravagant, a simply backdrop will do. You can also enlist the help of volunteer parents here, too.
 If you are just starting out and do not have any microphones, simply hire someone who knows how to work choir or shotgun mics. These are very inexpensive to rent and work quite well. Check with local production houses in your town for rental quotes.
 Volunteer parents are great helping with this, too.
 Social media is a rich source for helping get the word out for free. Facebook, Twitter, Digg all work great!
