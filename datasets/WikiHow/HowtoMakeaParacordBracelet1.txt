 To make an 8.5-inch bracelet, you'll need 13 feet of paracord (preferably 550 weight), scissors, a match or lighter, and an unbuckled plastic release buckle., Pull the loop through one side of the buckle., Pull the ends through the loop of cord. Pull it tight to make a knot, holding the cord in place., Pull the ends of the cord through the other side of the buckle. Wrap it around your wrist. Adjust the second buckle so that the bracelet fits properly. Fold the ends back around towards the first buckle. Take it off your wrist., Rotate the bracelet so you're holding the first buckle. Straighten out the ends. The left end loops back around towards the left side, and the right end loops towards the right side., Hold on to the left loose strand up near the buckle. Pull the left strand around the right side and then around the back. It should come back towards itself., Using the strand you just pulled around, pull it over the loop you are holding on to with your left hand. Weave it over the two left strands and under the two right strands. Weave it over the right loose cord.You know have two "core" strands on the left and two "core" strands on the right. The loose cords are separate from these core strands.
 Take the right strand, and weave it over the right core strands. Weave it under the left core strands., You had made a loop with the left strand. Pull the right strand up through that loop., Pull the stand to make it tighter., Starting with the right strand, repeat the process., At the other end, cut off the ends of the paracord even with the bracelet. Use a match or lighter to seal the ends.
