 Lightly grease the inside of a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking pan with oil or cooking spray.;
, Put the flour, sugar, coca powder, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir everything together with a rubber spatula until everything is evenly mixed together.


For a twist, try 1 cup (225 grams) of white sugar and 1 cup (200 grams) of brown sugar instead., Make a small well in the center of the flour mixture, then pour in the water, oil, and vanilla extract. Stir everything together until you get a smooth, creamy batter.


For lighter, less-riche brownies, use only ½ cup (120 milliliters) of oil.For richer brownies, use up to 1 cup (240 milliliters) of oil.
 Use a rubber spatula to do this, and be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl so that everything mixes evenly., Use a rubber spatula to help guild the batter into the pan, and to scrape any residue off the sides of the bowl. Is you need to, use the rubber spatula to help smooth the top of the batter down. This will help give your brownies a more consistent thickness.
 The brownies should be crusty and piping hot. You can check to see whether or not the brownies are done by poking a toothpick into the center. If the toothpick comes out dry and clean, they're done! If not, bake the brownies for another 5 to 10 minutes.
 Keep the brownies in the baking pan as you cut them, then serve them on a plate. They go great with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
