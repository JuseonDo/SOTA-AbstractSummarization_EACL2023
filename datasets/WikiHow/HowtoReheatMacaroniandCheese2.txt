 The oven is usually the best way to heat up large quantities of macaroni and cheese, especially if you are reheating a leftover casserole.
 A glass baking dish is ideal., Add about 1 tablespoon of milk per 1 cup of macaroni and cheese. However, skip this step if you are reheating a mac and cheese casserole that has a crumb or crunchy topping.
 This should take 20-30 minutes.
 Add a layer of shredded cheese (cheddar works great!) to the top of your macaroni and cheese. After 20 minutes, remove the foil, and cook for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese topping is bubbly and brown.


For a bit of extra crunch, you could stir in 2-3 tablespoons of seasoned bread crumbs to the shredded cheese before sprinkling it on top.
