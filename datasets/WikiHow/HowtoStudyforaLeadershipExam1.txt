 If you are completing a leadership class, the exam will likely cover what you learned in class. If you are taking a leadership exam for education credentials, your state will provide test criteria.;
, You do not want to cram the night before the leadership exam. Spend at least a few weeks preparing for the test.



Organize your notes, handouts, books and other materials that may have been provided when you registered for the leadership exam or took classes that led up to the exam.
 For example, if the leadership exam is 3 hours long, set aside 3 hours a few days every week to study.
