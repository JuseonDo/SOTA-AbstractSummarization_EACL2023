 Check your refrigerator for the staples that need to be replaced. Milk, bread, eggs and cheese are all staples that should be available, and should go first on your shopping list. Expensive fresh fruit can be replaced with canned fruit. Macaroni and pasta are cheap, but not very nutritious. Meat is expensive in the short run, but packs a nutritional wallop that gets you a lot of bang for your buck.;
, Everything will look good, and you may end up buying more than you can afford.
 Looking at the bins of cheeses can make you want to buy more than you really need, so write down on the list exactly what type of cheese you want, add it to your cart and then walk to another aisle.
 There are often marked-down items there.
 He or she may point out some great deals, or mark meats down especially for you. Same thing works with the produce manager. Being friendly is free, but pays great dividends!

, There is usually a store brand version of most items that is cheaper and of comparable quality to the big name item.
 Comparing circulars from different stores might help you get a better deal.
,, Zero in on the aisle or store you need to buy the item, enter, buy the item, and then leave. Impulse buying will ruin any budget, and when yours is tight, it will just be worse.
 It might even be best to use a small adding machine, pocket size, and as you put the products in your shopping cart, calculate what you have spent, remember how much you have set aside to spend, and when you get close, stop shopping.
 This way, you will only buy the things you need without being tempted by other offers.
 If you note that you have gone over the amount you can spend, then return an item that you really do not need at the moment, and put it on another list of 'to buy next time'.
