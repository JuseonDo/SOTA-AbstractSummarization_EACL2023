 You will need ½ yard (0.46 meters) of four different types of fabric. Cotton fabric works the best for this project. Choose colors and prints that go well together. It might be a good idea to have a solid color in there as well., How long you cut the strips depends on how long you want the tutu to be. The strips need to be twice the length you want them to be, plus an extra 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters).Use a sharp part of fabric scissors or a rotary cutter.
 The cord needs to be long enough to wrap around the table and back of the high chair, plus about 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.48 centimeters). Choose a color that goes well with your fabric. White is always a safe bet, however., This will keep the fabric strips from slipping off. You can seal the ends of the cord with glue or tape to prevent fraying. If the cord is made out of a synthetic material, you can heat-seal it by holding it close to a flame.
 Fold a fabric strip in half with the right side facing out. Place it behind the cord, with the folded part sticking down, forming a loop.
 Gently tug on the loops to tighten the knot. Make sure that the right side of the fabric is facing out. Don't let the fabric twist too much.
 You can tie the strips on randomly or use a pattern. Keep going until you have the entire cord filled.Leave a few inches/centimeters at each end blank.
 Purchase a set of clear, plastic, self-adhesive hooks. Stick them around the table and back part of the high chair., Wrap the tutu around the highchair, allowing it to settle into the hooks. Tie the ends of the cord together so that the tutu doesn't fall off.
