 You can use an outdoor grill or a stovetop grill for this method.
 Choose some firm plums suitable for cooking. Rinse them with cool water, then pat them dry. Slice them in half, then remove the pits.
 If you have not already, melt the butter, either in a small saucepan or in the microwave. Pour it into a small mixing bowl, then add the sugar and ground cinnamon. Whisk the ingredients together using a fork or mini whisk., Set the plums down so that the cut side is facing up. Use a basting brush to coat each plum with the melted butter mixture.
 The plums are ready when they turn soft. You do not need to turn or flip the plums., Carefully slide a spatula under each plum, and transfer it to a place. Flip the plum over as you set it down, so that the grilled side is facing up.


Serve the plums with some Greek yogurt or toasted almond flakes, if desired.
