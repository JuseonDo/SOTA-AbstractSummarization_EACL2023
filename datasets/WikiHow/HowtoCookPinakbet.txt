 Cut the pork belly into thick slices., Add the pork, the two bay leaves, the 3 peeled cloves of garlic, the 1/2 tablespoons of salt, and the chopped onion to the pot. Pour in enough water to cover the pork., When it comes to a boil, turn down the heat. Let it simmer for about an hour. The pork should be fork-tender when done., Place the pork on a baking sheet in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven. Let it cook for half an hour to dry out the pork., If you want the pork to crisp up, heat up oil in a pan. Let the pork deep fry until crispy., Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces. Reserve for the stew., If possible, use the same saucepan you cooked the bagnet in from the recipe below. Place the 2 tablespoons of shrimp paste in the pan, and let it cook for a couple of minutes to release its flavor., Pour in a splash of oil to keep the ingredients from burning. Let them cook until the onions are lightly translucent., Add the three tomatoes in large chunks, the pinch of brown sugar, a dash of pepper, and a dash or two of patis. Stir it around for a few minutes., If you think some of your veggies, such as the eggplant, is too tough, you may need to add it in ahead of the other vegetables.Note that some recipes say to add the pork at the end rather than with the vegetables., Only add enough broth to give the vegetables some moisture. You don't want to cover the vegetables with broth., Cover the pot tightly, and let the stew cook for about 15 to 20 minutes. You can toss the vegetables by shaking the pot, but leave the lid on., At 15 minutes, check to see if the vegetables are tender. If they are, remove the pot from the stove., Plate the rice with the stew poured over the top.
