 It doesn't have to be complicated, frozen waffles and hot chocolate is perfect, but make it something special they don't have every day.;
, Many stations have all day Christmas Eve marathons of specials and movies, or you can use a movie rental service or the public library to get their favorites.
 Cinnamon Ornaments, paper snowflakes, and paper chains are all fairly easy projects.
 Set them up with crayons, pencils, markers, or some other kind of coloring medium and let them have fun! This is a good time to do any preparations you still need to do before Christmas Day.
 What you eat is entirely up to you, but do try to make it something you both enjoy.
 Settle down and watch some more Christmas movies or specials.
, Even if they're very young they can still help you measure and mix the ingredients. If you make sugar cookies, they can help you decorate them once they're baked and cooled.
 Put both near the Christmas tree. Don't forget the reindeer! Carrots or Reindeer Food are good choices!
