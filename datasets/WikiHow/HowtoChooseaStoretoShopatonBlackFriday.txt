 Compare ads, and look for which store has the all around better deals on products that you want to buy.;
, A lot of stores open for Black Friday deals as early as 4:00 pm on Thanksgiving Day. If you don't want to be out shopping, and want to spend time with your family because it is a holiday, then don't go to any stores that open that early, as you will most likely miss out on spending time with your loved ones.
 There's been some stores that have had people trampled, and some stores have been more prone to fights, so if you don't want to deal with any of that, then avoid those stores.
 This will give you a general idea of which stores people like to shop at on Black Friday best.
 Most likely, if the store you chose has had good deals for all the other things that you wanted, they will have a good deal on that item too.
 If you want to go to a store thirty or more minutes away, then you will definitely have to leave earlier than a store five minutes away.
 If you wait, all of the products that you want to buy may already be gone, especially if you wanted a big ticket item, such as a TV. A good time to get there is half an hour before opening.
