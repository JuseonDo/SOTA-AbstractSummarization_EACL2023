 R-value represents the thermal resistance of the insulation.


Guidelines and recommendations can be found through the International Energy Conservation Code. For the United States, most insulation falls somewhere between R-5 and R-10.

This insulation is made of flexible fibers ranging from fiberglass to natural fibers such as sheep's wool. It comes in either batts or rolls.






Use unfaced blanket insulation if your insulation is going over existing insulation.
 Facings are coverings over the insulation such as vinyl, foil, or craft paper.
