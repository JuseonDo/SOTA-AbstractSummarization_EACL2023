 Babies will reject you if you don't look appealing.;
, Put in nice furniture. Don't overdo it TOO much, or you may not have space to move around!

, Look for mommy tryouts or toddlers. Some are in boxes. Open the box and say hello. Don't ask suddenly, "Can I be your mommy?" Instead, ask if they have a mom. If they say no, say "I'll be your mom."

,, Add them so you can talk when you are away. You can buy them a friendship bracelet if you are Premium!

,, Don't be disappointed! You can still send them to school, cook food, and go on vacation! If they want to hang out with friends, don't go with them. Instead, P.M. them. Be nice to their one.
 Don't abandon them!
