 If you're using Windows, make sure you're connected to the Internet, and double-click the time on the taskbar. When the "Time and Date Properties" box appears, click the "Internet Time" tab. Then simply click the "Update Now" button and click OK.
 It's best if you make this one a watch, it makes it easier to bring about when syncing the other clocks in your home.
 How this is done depends on whether the clock is analogue, which uses hands, or digital, which uses numbers.
