 The yeast needs warm water to activate; it will help the doughnut dough rise and stay fluffy. Let activate for 5 minutes.;
, Alternatively, you can use a wooden spoon and mix by hand, but be sure to mix the dry ingredients first, then the wet ingredients separately, and then combine the two.
 Do this until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl.
, Cover with a towel and let stand until dough doubles in volume (about 1 hour). Dough will be ready when you can press a finger into it and the indentation stays.
 Cut with a floured doughnut cutter, or cut into doughnut shapes by hand.
 Lay them out on a tray and cover them with a large, clean towel.
 This is a classic butter glaze, not unlike the Krispy Kreme glaze that is popular in America. To make the glaze:


Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Be careful not to burn the butter.
Take the butter off the iron and stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth.
Stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is thin, but not watery.
 Use a kitchen thermometer for maximum precision.


To avoid a greasy taste, heat the oil up on medium high for five minutes, and then gently reduce the heat until thermometer reads 350℉ (175℃).
 Turn the doughnuts over when they float up to the surface. Fry evenly on both sides until golden brown.
 Make sure any excess oil drips off the doughnut before you glaze it.
 Set to dry on a wire rack and enjoy immediately.
