 While a crisp apple is favorable, you want an apple that will allow you to pierce through its skin with the melon ball scoop. Also, select large apples so you can create a larger amount of mini apples.


Consider buying a few lemons in the event you plan to make several apples. A few squirts of lemon on top of the waiting scooped apples will prevent oxidation, which may discolor the mini apples.;
, This depends on how you like your caramel apples. You could also candy the apple as well so this step is simply a matter of choice.
 Each mini apple will be mounted on top of a stick so select your stick based on the size of your mini apples.
, This could also include candy corn or any other Halloween type candy.


Purchase cello-wrap if you plan to present these apples as a gift or party favor. This includes colorful twist ties or ribbon to tie the cello-wrap in place.
