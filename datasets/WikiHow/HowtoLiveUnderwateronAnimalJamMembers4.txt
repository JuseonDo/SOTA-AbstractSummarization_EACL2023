plan a birthday party for an underwater friend.
@article
 Go to Bahari Bay. Say hi to some jammers. Become besties with some. And have best moments underwater together.
 Go to bahari bay (ocean main area) to advertise your events and trading. And bahari bay is the best place to make buddies.
 If they tell you that today is their birthday, throw them an underwater bash! (See next method to plan.)
