 In order to install maps directly from your Android phone or tablet, you'll need a file manager app. This will allow you to extract the downloaded map file and place it in the correct location so that Minecraft can read it.


Two of the most popular apps for installing maps are AndroZip and ES File Explorer.
 The ZIP file will be downloaded to the "Downloads" folder on your device.


Make sure that the map you are downloading has been made for Pocket Edition

, You will see a list of folder on your Android device.
,,, This will copy the Minecraft map data into your game.
 You will be able to select your new map from the Worlds list. You can select it to begin playing it just like any other saved game.


You can also use the "Maps for Minecraft PE 2014" app to browse through a large collection of different maps that can be installed with a couple taps.
