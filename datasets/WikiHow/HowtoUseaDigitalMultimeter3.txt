 If you're unsure of the current, start in the 10 amp terminal until you're sure the current is less than 300 milliamps.
 This may be represented by the letter A.
, To measure current, you must place the multimeter in series with the circuit. Place the probes on either side of the break, observing polarity (black probe on negative side, red probe on positive side.)

, The current will run through the circuit, up the red probe and through the multimeter, then out the black probe and into the circuit.
 You can use the touch-hold feature if desired.
