 Is it because your friends or someone you admire is doing it? Is it because you want to stop supporting animal cruelty? Do you feel you'd be healthier? Do you want to adopt a religion that requires veganism?;
, Make sure they are worthy reasons and that you are really committed before you approach your parents. Do some research to support your reasons, many parents will worry about your health, so read some books or at least websites about vegan nutrition.
 It is a very big change and a couple of important nutrients are hard to find in plant products, so you will need to make sure you get some fortified foods and a proper multivitamin.
 If you are currently eating all different types of foods, consider starting off as a vegetarian. Eliminating meat and dairy from your diet gradually is safer than suddenly switching to nuts and celery after a lifetime of hamburgers. Your body does get used to the kinds of foods you eat, and it will react badly to extreme changes.
 Tell them you'd like to become a vegan and explain the reasons why.
 Back this up with medical research.
 Your parents may not be eager to cook special vegan meals for you, so be prepared to fix some of your own food. Suggest some vegetarian or vegan recipes that the family can try, and make them together.
