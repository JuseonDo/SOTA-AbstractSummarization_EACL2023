If your child already has a limited local account on this computer, it’s not necessary to create another. Instead, select the previously-established child account from the list of users in the “Family Safety” settings when prompted later in this method.
,,


Using a simple username like “kids,” or the child’s first name, is fine.
If you’d prefer there to be no password for this new account, leave the password field blank.

“Allow list only” will make it so the child user can only view websites you add to the access list.
“Designed for children” includes the above option, but also includes websites that are rated for children.
“General interest” includes all of the above, plus additional items from the “general interest” category (non-adult sites that are informational or safe entertainment, but NOT social media).
“Online Communication” allows everything above, plus social media, chat and email access.
“Warn on Adult” includes everything above, AND adult websites. Adult websites, however, will be prefaced with a warning message.
 Click “Allow or Block Websites” on the left side of the screen. To add a website to the block list (meaning that this user will not be able to access the site), type the URL into the box and click “Block.” You can also add the URLs of sites you always want to allow through the filter (no matter which filters you enabled previously). Type the URL into the blank, then click “Allow.” Close the window when you are done.


Sites like YouTube may be blocked by filters, but your child may need to use it for school.
 The child will not be protected by web restriction when using any other account but the child account. He or she can click their user name, then enter their account password if prompted.
