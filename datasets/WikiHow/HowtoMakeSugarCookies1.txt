, You can do this using an electric mixer or a food processor on a medium speed setting. It will take about 3 minutes.If you cannot find shortening, you can use another ½ cup (115 grammes) of butter instead.
 Keep beating until everything is evenly combined. There should be not streaks of unmixed egg yolk. Set the butter mixture aside when you are done.
 If you'd like your sugar cookies to be less sweet, add ½ teaspoon of salt.
 Set your mixer to the lowest possible speed setting, and add in the flour mixture 1 cup (100 grammes) at a time.
 Don't roll all of the dough out, however; a baking sheet can only fit so many cookies. Instead, roll out only as many cookies as you can fit onto your baking sheet.
 Space the cookies 1½ to 2 inches (3.81 to 5.08 centimeters) apart.The sugar will give the cookies a nice texture after they are baked.
 Do not flatten the cookies so much that they stick together. They will flatten a little while you bake them.
 While the first batch of cookies baking, you can start rolling out the next batch. Then, when the first batch is cooling, you can start baking the second batch.
 You can leave them plain, or you can spread some coloured buttercream on top and add some sprinkles.
