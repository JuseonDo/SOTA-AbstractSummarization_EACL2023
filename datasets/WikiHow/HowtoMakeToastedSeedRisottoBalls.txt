, Add the spring onions and garlic and cook gently. After two minutes, add the rice and cook over a medium heat for 2 minutes, stirring often. Do not let the rice colour.
 Do this half a cup at a time, stirring all the while. Continue stirring until all of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice on each occasion until all of the stock has been added.
,, One the mixture has cooled down completely, dampen your hands. Form the risotto mixture into balls. This recipe should make about 12 balls in all.
 Put the seeds into a food processor. Process the seeds until they resemble breadcrumbs.
 Roll the risotto balls across the seed mixture to coat each ball.
 Put into the refrigerator to chill and set for 10 minutes.
, Prior to placing in the oven, spray or dollop a little oil on each one to aid the crisping process.
 The balls can be served as cocktail food or snacks on a plate with dipping sauce of choice. If you like, they can also be served as a dinner item, on a plate with salad and beans. Lemon wedges also go well with this dish.
