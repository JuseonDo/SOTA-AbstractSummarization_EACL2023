Draw a circle for the head and a pear-shaped figure just below it.
Optional: draw a vertical line from both ends of the pear.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.;
,


Draw 2 tall pointed arcs for the ears.
Add a horizontal oval at the bottom of the head. This will be the jaw or the cheek of the squirrel.



This will be your squirrel tail.



Draw a circle at the base of the pear, this will be the squirrel’s hip bone. Since the angle is on the ¾ view, only half of the other hip bone should appear.
For the arm, add a long tilted U on the body.



This will be your squirrel’s paws.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose and fur.
You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.



Squirrel can go in different shades from orange to red or even brown or gray, all depending on the breed.
