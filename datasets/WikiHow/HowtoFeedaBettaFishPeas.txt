 Make sure you only microwave your pea for only 30-60 seconds., Once you got the pea out, you can use a pair of tweezer and remove the skin part of the pea. You won't feed the skin part of the pea to your Betta, so you can dispose of it., You will not need a lot because if you did get a lot, your Betta fish will become more bloated., You can use a net or something of that sort. Make sure you take out the leftover pea very gently so that you won't stress your Betta fish out.,
