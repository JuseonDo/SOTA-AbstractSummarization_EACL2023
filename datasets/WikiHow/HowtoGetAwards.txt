 If you want to be awarded, work for it. Try your very best.;
, Goals can inspire you to work harder.
 Keep trying, even if you don't succeed at first.
 This is a great motivator and doing it everyday can greatly help you.
 Awards are not something you receive immediately, so you need to be patient, and avoid frustration.
 Even if you improve yourself just a little every day, by the end of the year you will be a much better person.
 Make sure you fill in all the application forms, if there are any, and plan out your strategy in advance.
 Find out what you're good at and use that talent to your advantage.
 Work hard and you might win it next time!

, Thank the award givers and enjoy the moment!
