 Most computer companies have retained their senior technical support departments in-house or have special groups set up to deal with requests for someone who speaks English as a first language.
 The agent will need this information to start a case file before transferring you to another department.
 Your issue may be simple enough to require very little time, whereas a call transfer may take longer than expected. The guidelines in the next section should help.



Do ask if it would be possible to speak to a senior technical agent for a second opinion.
Do not ask to be transferred to a manager. Asking to speak to a manager is not the same as asking to be transferred to another agent. Managers usually aren't trained to support customers beyond assisting with complaints or issues of procedure.
Do thank the original agent for their assistance and explain that you would simply like to work with someone else as you are encountering a communication barrier.
Do not belittle or chastise the original agent or make them feel as if the reason for the transfer request is due to their personality or technical inability.
