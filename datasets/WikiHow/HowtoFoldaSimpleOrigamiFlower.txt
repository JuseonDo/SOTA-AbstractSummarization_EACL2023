 (This step, and the next one, are optional, but it the next two steps a little bit easier);
,, (this is where steps 2 and 3 help you)

,,, Let's call the side you just folded the 'top side' and the side with the two sets of corners folded to the middle the 'bottom side'. Have the top side facing you and the bottom side down. Look at the flaps on the bottom side. Stick your fingers into these and push them all to the middle. (index and thumb is easiest)

, You should be looking at something like this. This is a completed fortune teller. The next steps tell you how to turn it into a flower.
 Fold each one of the points at the bottom on these up to the points at the top.
 (at about this time in the folding, a hole may start to form in the middle, which is just from all the wear-and-tear to the paper)

,, Fold them back and tuck them under themselves, making a white square appear in the center (make sure you do this well - they come untucked easily). Turn it over and fold the flaps out to make this - and your finished!
