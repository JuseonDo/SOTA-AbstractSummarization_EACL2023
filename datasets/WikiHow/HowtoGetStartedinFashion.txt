While having a college degree in a fashion-related field is not absolutely mandatory, it will definitely make your career goals much easier to obtain. If you can't do this, you will have to teach yourself everything you need to know that you would otherwise learn in school. History of fashion, general business skills, garment construction, and how to appreciate art are only a few of the many things all fashion devotees must know.
 Experience is KEY.
 Read news and watch fashion shows online. Research the looks of celebrities, models etc.
