once in the academy you will find that you are placed on the lowest rungs of the police ladder.

remember a lot of the things that they have you do in the academy may be done correctly but it will not matter because you will still get crap for it anyway.

when you finally make it to graduation, you'll feel like you couldn't be prouder of everything you accomplished.

 So expect to be treated accordingly when you're dealing with superiors.
, The point of the academy is to weed out those that are not 100% committed to this career from those that are, aside from training you how to become a police officer.
 Once you finish this nothing else will seem as great a milestone as that moment when you are finally sworn in as a police officer. From that moment you would look back at the 6 months of hell in which you were tased, pepper sprayed, gassed and put through hell by your Drill Instructors and think that it was all worth it. You are now considered a member of a special group, that thin blue line that only a certain few are a part of. You are a rookie officer in your prime and are ready to serve and protect the citizens that may at times despise you and other times adore you. Just remember that whatever happens stay safe and stick together.
