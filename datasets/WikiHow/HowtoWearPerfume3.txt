When wearing a stronger fragrance, such as an eau de parfum or a parfum classic, only dab perfume on your wrists and throat.
If youâ€™re wearing an eau de toilette or an eau de cologne, also consider dabbing some on the pulse points behind your ears, on your chest, inside your elbows, and behind your knees.
 The stronger the scent, the further back you should hold the bottle.
 Even though this is a common practice, doing so crushes the chemicals and alters the balance of the scent. Instead, spray a small amount of scent onto your skin and let it dry naturally.
