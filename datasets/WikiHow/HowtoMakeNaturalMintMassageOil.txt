 While there are many carrier oils to choose from, grapeseed oil has virtually no scent and is readily available in your local supermarket.


It is important that you use a glass bowl and avoid wood or plastic utensils as they are highly absorptive and can contaminate your massage oil.;
,


The minty aromas of eucalyptus and peppermint stimulate the mind and body, help aid in digestion and clear a stuffy nose, making this combination perfect for a morning massage or for those suffering from a mild coldThis will soothe the muscles, repair the mind, and brighten your skin. Mint is supposed to heal, and it really does.
 Carefully pour the finished mint massage oil into a dark glass bottle. The dark glass helps to protect the oils against oxidizing too quickly.
,, You really want to use as much as you can the first time, but without wasting it.
 Massages are relaxing, and relaxing is a fun time for most people! Just enjoy the relaxation.
