 Power punchers generally keep their lead (left) foot closer to square with their right than straight punchers.;
, This foot will move when you move forward to deliver the blow.
Shift your left foot onto the toe and twist rightward as if you are stamping out a cigarette.
Lower your left arm and cock it at a 50 degree angle
Twist your torso to the left.
Keep your right hand at the chin as a guard.

Use all of the force you can muster to unwind your torso.
Keep your chin down (always) and your head facing forward. Ideally, your head will stay in the same place throughout the duration of the punch.
Keep your left arm locked at a 90-degree angle.
, Don't twist so much that you fall over. Maintain your balance.


Quickly twist back into your normal stance. It will feel fluid and fast. You are very vulnerable to a straight right (a knockout punch) after you have thrown a left hook.
