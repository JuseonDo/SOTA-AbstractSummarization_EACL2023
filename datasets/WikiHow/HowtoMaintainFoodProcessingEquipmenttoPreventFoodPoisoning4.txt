 Bacteria in urine, feces and soil can easily be introduced into food processing equipment.
 Running water is your best defense against many types of bacteria found in soil or animal processing plants.
 Make sure the equipment is completely submerged and cleaned with a scrubbing agent. Cleansing agents can include alkaline detergents, acid builders, water conditioners and oxidizing agents.
 The cleaning process will make the sanitation process more effective, so do not choose 1 or the other. Buy specially formulated kitchen sanitizers whenever possible.
 Ensure wet towels or rags are never left in or near equipment, as they can harbor bacteria.
 Hang them to dry. This includes equipment with wooden handles.
