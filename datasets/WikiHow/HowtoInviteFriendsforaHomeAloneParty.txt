if you are going to text your friends to invite them, be casual and tell them where and when that party is.

@summary
although inviting friends is the easy part, it's the getting ready and setting up everything that takes a little longer.

@summary
music.

@summary
you might want to invite 1, 2, or 3 close friends round first so that when everybody shows up, it won't be just you there.

@summary
get dressed into a nice dress or nice outfit .

@summary
remember it's officially a party only if you and your friends post lists of pictures to social media!,

@summary
have a good night and be a responsible host.make sure there is plenty of time before your parents are getting back and when the party ends, because it will be awkward whether you had their permission or not.your parents are trusting you to be home alone with people they may or may not know, so accept your parents' opinion and ask them if they have any rules they want you and your friends to follow,never invite the opposite gender that could get you in serious trouble it may harm you if no grown ups are around.

@summary
if your party is expected to get a little louder, and you have sensitive neighbors, make sure to inform them that you plan on having a party.

 At the end of the message, say: "You can come if you like, no worries if you can't make it!". You are going to want a rough estimate of how many people are coming so ask them to let you know if they are coming or not. Don't invite anybody that you don't know as this will be a home alone party. Make sure you don't post it on any social media before the party (or after if you don't have your parents' permission) Make sure you get your friend's parents' permission for them to be home alone.
 You are going to want to make some space for dancing in your house. Therefore, this will require you to move some furniture in your house. You don't have to do this alone, you can ask family or friends to help you. Make sure that there are not any valuables on show so that nobody can steal or break them. Put anything that is breakable or valuable away in a cupboard, cabinet, or a room which will be out of bounds just in case., Get some loud and big speakers so that everyone will be able to hear the music. Pick out some up to date music to ensure that people will like it and have a good time. It's best if you use a playlist from Spotify. etc., Get some party food such as pizza, sausage rolls, cake, chips, soft drinks, and other party foods., Do your hair nicely and put some perfume on. Make sure your home smells nice and put any finishing touches like decorations., (as long as your parents know that you are having a party!), Your parents won't trust you to have another party if they come home to see their house look like a tornado went through it. Before the guests come, you might want to put some important items away that are breakable. (Cups, expensive jewelry or others),,,, Leaving your number for them to call you is always a good idea., Your friends should be entertained well. You can always come up with some games or activities for your guests to do. Don't have a lame party, with nothing the guests can do.
