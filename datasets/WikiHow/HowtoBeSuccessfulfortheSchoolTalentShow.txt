 It could be singing, dancing, or playing an instrument. Make sure that the act you are doing showcases your talents. If you are doing anything involving music, make sure the music lyrics are compliant with your school's code.;
, If your act is too hard or a part of it is difficult, edit that part out, redo it, or find something different to do.
 Relax. Just go into the room and do your thing! Remember to say "Thank you" when you are done. You will find out later if you got in. If you did, congratulate yourself! If you didn't, ask the judges what fault they found in your performance so you know what to look out for next time!

,, This is your time to mess up. Try on your outfit and makeup to see how it looks, and ask others. Accept advice or criticism when given.
