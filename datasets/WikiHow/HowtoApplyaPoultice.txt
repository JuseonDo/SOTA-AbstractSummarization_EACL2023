You may use fruits and vegetables in poultices, too. These are usually grated instead of ground.
Already-fine herbs and powders don't need to be ground.;

Some herbs should be warmed before application as a poultice. Warm poultices are particularly useful for drawing out pus and soothing inflammation.
Warm the herbal paste either in the microwave or a double boiler. Some purists might disagree with microwaving herbal medication, but there is no arguing the microwave's convenience.
You may create a poultice from a single herb, or a combination. With combination poultices, several steps--for example, cutting, grinding, grating, mixing and heating--are involved with creating the herbal application.



Cheesecloth is ideal for applying poultices.
Depending on which herbal formulation you're using, you will either apply the herbal preparation directly to your skin (with the single layer of cloth over it) or place another layer of cloth between your skin and the moistened herbs.



If you don't have plastic wrap handy, you can use a clean bandage to hold the poultice in place.
