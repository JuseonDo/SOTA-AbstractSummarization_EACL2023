 This is where you type in an abbreviation and it expands automatically upon hitting space bar, full stop, colon, tab key etc.


For example, to replace "clcn" with the word "calculation":;
,, Tab across to "With" column and type full expression (for example, "calculation").
 (This will stay checked until you change it.)

,


When you next type "clcn" and hit one of the expansion keys listed above, you will immediately have the full expression "calculation" on your screen.

Tip: To speed up creation of a QC item, put a button in the menu bar.
,, Drag this item to your menu bar.



You should now have a button named "QuickCorrect". To create new QC items simply click on this button.

Note: It is possible to create different menus for different types of work and select them as required.
Note: Unlike MS Word there is no limit to the number of abbreviations, although each individual item is restricted to about 132 characters. For larger items use either QuickWords or create an individual document and insert it as required.
