when in dangerous open area, take short sprints from safe covered spots to other safe covered spots.try to go around fire fights, a lot of people get caught up in intense fights in the same part of each map, going around the fight and attacking from behind is a sure fire way to earn some kills

 You have 95 spaces so you're free to mix and match. Try to keep a class for every distance, Short range is best done with an smg, medium/long with assault rifles, long and extreme long should be done with sniper rifles.;
,, when you fire an un-suppressed gun, you will appear as a small red dot on enemy radar and on a map that is pulled up by an enemy before he calls an air strike. Firing a suppressed gun does not make you appear on enemy radar.
 You will remain invisible to enemy radar when an enemy calls in a UAV, which reveals the location of certain enemies for a period of about 30 seconds.
 AS SOON AS RED JETS APPEAR ON YOUR RADAR, GET INDOORS IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE AN ENEMY AIR STRIKE IS COMING IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS. Green jets are O.K. because that is a friendly airstrike and it can't kill you (unless friendly fire is on).
 It takes a lot of bullets, but it can be destroyed. It is recommended that you have an RPG on your team so he can destroy it easily.
, Find the one you like. I personally like the MP5 with a Silencer 3 Flashbangs or Stun Grenades for Perk 1, Stopping power or Sleight of Hand (faster reloading) for Perk 2, and Martyrdom or Last Stand for perk 3.
 Avoid sprinting the whole lot, since its pretty easy shooting a linear moving foe.* No cover? Do the following drill, sprint->Jump->crouch->sprint, impossible to get a clean torso/headshot.
, this way if you have even any skill you will win 1 on 1 every time.
