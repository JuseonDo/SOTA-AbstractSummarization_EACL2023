@article
 Use 6 ounces/180ml if you are certain of the freshness of the starter. When in doubt, use a full cup of buttermilk as starter.;
,, Shake thoroughly to mix. Label it with the date.
 If you find it takes longer than 36 hours, the starter was no longer active (the bacteria had died). The buttermilk may or may not be tasty if it takes longer than 36 hours but it can still be used for baking.
 This happens because the bacteria have fermented the milk, and the lactic acid is causing the milk proteins to thicken. Refrigerate immediately
