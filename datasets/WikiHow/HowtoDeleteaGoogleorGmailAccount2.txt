 You'll need to use a browser to delete your Gmail address.
 You'll see this button in the upper-right corner. If you're already signed in, make sure it's with the Gmail account you want to delete.


When you're signed in, you'll see your current account's profile picture in the upper-right corner. Click this and click "Sign out" to sign in with a different account.
 You don't need to do this if you're already signed in with the correct account.
,,, This button looks like a trashcan.
 This will be the email address you use to sign into other Google products, such as Drive or YouTube.


The email address will need to be verified, so make sure it's an account you can access.
,, It may take a few minutes to appear.
 When your new address is verified, your Gmail account will be permanently deleted.
