, This end is the weakest part of the walnut.
 Do this a few times and the prised open end should start to split, leaving the walnut in halves.
 Cut it long enough to allow for the cradle to hang from a hook or tree branch.
 Keep it balanced.
 Wind a pipe cleaner around a pencil to make a coil.


The coiled pipe cleaner will give the impression of a baby's body beneath the cloth you'll add shortly.
 Glue the bead at one end of the coil.
 Cut a small rectangle from the scrap fabric.
 Glue into place at one end of the walnut half.
 Cut the scrap fabric into a narrowed down half circle shape, the same shape as the tapering of the walnut. This piece needs to be big enough to fit over baby's body and the lower part of the walnut shell.


This will be added to the cradle in the next section.
 When adding, leave space at one end for the baby's head. Glue in place.


The head should sit up a little, as if the baby is looking up and out.
 It should cover the body completely but stop underneath the baby's head; adjust as needed.


Glue all around the edges. This stops fraying from happening.
 Use the fine marker to draw eyes and a smile. The eyes can show baby asleep or awake.


It's up to you whether you add more features, such as two nostrils for a nose or a little squiggle for "hair".
 The walnut baby can now be hung on a tree branch, off a hook, or anywhere else. You can also rest the walnut baby on a shelf.


Make as many more as you please.
