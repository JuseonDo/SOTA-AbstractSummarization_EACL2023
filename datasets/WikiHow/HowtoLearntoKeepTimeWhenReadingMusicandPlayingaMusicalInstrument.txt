@summary
the simple way to develop your rhythm is with simple clapping exercises.

@summary
get someone, be it a friend, a family member, or a music teacher/tutor, to clap a simple tune/rhythm.

@summary
get someone to play a rhythmic melody (piano or any other instrument will do) and see if you can copy the rhythm played by clapping it out.

@summary
for homework: when listening to your favourite music, try nodding to the beat, then clapping or clicking your fingers to time.

 A metronome will often help keep rhythm as you go, if you are having trouble keeping a steady beat.


If you don't wish to clap, tapping your foot, or tapping your lap with your hand works just as good. The lap is great because you can practice keeping beat with one hand while tapping a harmonic rhythm with the other.

, Your aim is simply to copy the clapping. The more accurate you are, the more you'll be able to copy rhythms you hear.


Make sure they make their clapping progressively more advanced so you know at what stage you can still copy what you hear.

The advanced stuff should only be used once you have mastered the initial exercises.
 Then respond but this time with playing your instrument instead.
 Record yourself doing this then play it back. What were the results? If you're not sure, get someone with 'better ears' to comment and help out.


Do this regularly until you've developed an understanding of coming on time.
