if they say no, don't start whining.if they do say no, find a good website that doesn't spam (i would recommend either mytinyphone.com or zedge.com)

@article
 If you want them for showing them off with your friends, maybe it's not a good idea. If you want them just for your fun or for identifying quickly your cell phone when someone's calling you, go ahead.;
, Some sites may be more expensive than others even if they both offer the same products. Try to make a list of the sites with better contents and cheaper prices.
 If your parents don't like buying ringtones, they won't like to buy too many ringtones. Also, bear in mind that some ringtones may offend other people: very loud, aggressive and dirty talk ringtones may be funny, but they aren't appreciated in public, and it's very likely your parents won't like it.
 Tell them that you want to talk. Do it so they can understand. Tell them what you want quietly, but firmly. Stick to the point, and never get angry, whine or complain.
 Stay calmed and try to argue as little as possible, if your parents get angry, they won't want to talk about it and their final answer will be a No.
 Your parents will appreciate the fact that you know the value of money, and even more the fact that you can set a compromise and keep it. Maybe you could get a part time job so that you can earn the money for buying your ringtones, maybe you can give up buying another thing. Think about alternatives that suit both your parents and you.
 If you keep your promises, your parents will see that you are responsible, and will be more helpful the next time you ask for something

, Just finish the conversation peacefully.
