@article
 Your knees should be lower than your hips (whether you sit in a chair or cross-legged).
 Draw the chin in slightly.
 You should come to rest with your center of gravity at a point about two or three inches below your navel. Try to push the top and back of your head upwards so there is strength in your neck.
,, Full deep breaths (from the bottom of the belly) are best, but don't force anything. Count your breath from one to ten. Exhale on the odd numbers. Inhale on the even numbers.
 Concentrate on being in-the-moment.
 These are natural. If you find yourself becoming distracted by your thoughts then the problem is likely your posture. Ensure the spine is erect and the body weight is centered at a point two or three inches below the navel.
, You will immediately notice your lack of concentration when you forget counting or repeating the same number several times.;
, So = Exhale. Ham = Inhale. It is a Sanskrit meaning "I AM THAT" - If you observe your breath and the natural sound of your breathing air flow, you might hear this sound like a very silent natural whisper. You unconsciously speak SANSKRIT saying "I am part of the creation." = So HAM
