 When you notice that you've accidentally delete or overwritten a file, do not save anything else on that hard drive. Avoid running programs as well. Whenever new data is written to the drive, there's a chance that it could be set to override the data from the old file. Not saving anything increases the chances that you'll be able to recover the file., Download the installer to another drive on your computer, or on a different computer altogether. Recuva is available for free from www.piriform.com.
