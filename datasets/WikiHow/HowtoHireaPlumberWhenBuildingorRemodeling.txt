 It is always smarter to hire contractors via the referral process because it ensures that the recommended contractor is reliable. Just make sure that your friend or family member refers a plumber who specializes in construction or renovations, rather than one who concentrates on emergency calls such as clogged pipes.;
, Compare their reliability, time-management, work ethics and anything else that your referrers mention when suggesting a contractor.
 Allow them all to quote an estimated cost for the job and time frame, and have them include a list of materials that they would use. Review all the responses.
 Determine what you feel is appropriate for your project, and remember that plumbing projects should be constructed with quality materials. Anything less could result in more expensive repairs in the near future.
 Note that the least expensive quote is not always the best. Consider the pricing next to the materials that the plumber needs and determine which plumber is offering the best deal. Confirm that the quote that is presented to you includes clean-up.
 Those who have been established for many years are possibly more trustworthy. The length of their existence is usually an indication that they are established and will likely be around for years to come.
 Make sure that they also hold both liability insurance and workers' compensation.
 Do they have policies in place to avoid injuries and damage? In the event that there is damage to your property, are they prepared to be held accountable?

, In the event that something goes wrong or you have plumbing issues associated to the work done, will the plumber return to fix the problem?
