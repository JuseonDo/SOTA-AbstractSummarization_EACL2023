this could prepare you for some spongebob cosplay or fanfics, so making sure you watched the show properly is important.

 This can be on your couch or sitting down, make sure it is comfortable though and you have minimum disturbances.;
, You might want to get healthy snacks, as you won't be doing a whole lot of exercise. Also, you might want to grab a snack that is not real messy, because if it is messy you have to clean up after it.
 This is important if the sound is to high then you could hurt your ears or disturb somebody. But if it too low (for any reasons) then you could not hear it and this will severely affect how well you enjoy the show. If you have to have a low volume, then try turning on the subtitles or try sitting closer to the TV(not to close, as this could disturb your eyes).
 This may vary if you are using NETFLIX or watching it off a DVD. But make sure you know where it is(what channel, location of DVD etc) or you won't be watching that show.
 Having to get up, will make you miss pieces of the show.
, A lot of people don't do this, but you can get a better user experience and that might make you come back for more.
