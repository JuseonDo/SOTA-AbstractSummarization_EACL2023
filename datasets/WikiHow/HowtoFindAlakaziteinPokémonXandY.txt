 Abra can be found in Route 5. Train it to Level 16 to evolve into Kadabra. Trade it to someone and then get it back as an Alakazam.;
,, Once he leaves, scan your ticket at the orange ticket scanner, the one closest to you. You are on your way to Kiloude City., He will give you a VS recorder. Next, go to the Battle Maison. It won't be too hard to find. It's the large, fancy building right smack in the middle of the city., Your options are Single, Double, Triple, Rotation, and Multi. Select any of these options, and you will battle a trainer. When you win, you will be given 1 Battle Point(or BP). The reception lady will ask what you want to do next. Unless you want to keep battling, chose the option "take a break"., You will find your rival near the benches. They'll ask you to battle, so accept the challenge. After you defeat him/her, your rival will tell you that the professor is waiting for you by the Anistar sundial.,,,,,, There you will find your prize: The Alakazite!
