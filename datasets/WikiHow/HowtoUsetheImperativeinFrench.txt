@summary
when using verbs that contain infinitives ending in -er, we remove the final letter "s" from the -tu form of the present tense for the imperative, unless it is followed by the pronouns -y or -en.

@summary
there are three verbs that are irregular in the imperative, taking their imperative from the present subjunctive form.

@summary
when you want to form the negative imperative form, simply put -ne in front of the imperative and -pas or an alternative after it.

@summary
when using object pronouns with the imperative, the pronouns follow the verb and are hyphenated.

@summary
however, with the negative imperative, the pronouns will precede verb, as in these examples:

@summary
ne lui dites rien.

@summary
with reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun follows the imperative, and -te changes to -toi.

@summary
just as we saw earlier with object pronouns, however, in the negative imperative of reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun precedes the verb, and -te is used, not -toi.

 Here are some examples:

Regarde; (Look) (To those you would normally address as "tu")
Regardons; (Let's look)
Regardez; (Look) (To those you would normally address as "vous")



 

;
, For example:


ÃŠtre (To be): Sois, Soyons, Soyez. (Ex; "Sois sage" means "Be good".)
Avoir (To have): Aie, Ayons, Ayez. (Ex; "Ayons de la patience" means "Let's have patience".)
Savoir (To know): Sache, Sachons, Sachez. (Ex; "Sachez vos amis" means "Know your friends".)

, For example:


Ne va pas au parc. (Don't go to the park.)

, Some examples:


Donne-le-lui! (Give it to him!)
Achetons-en. (Let's buy some.)
Vas-y. (Go there.) Remember the letter "s" is kept when followed by -y or -en.

Parlez-moi! (Speak to me!) Notice the emphatic "moi" is used rather than "me"; -toi would be used instead of -te.
 (Don't tell him anything.)
Ne nous oubliez jamais. (Never forget us.)
Ne leur en donne pas. (Don't give them any (of it).)
N'y va plus. (Don't go there any more.)
