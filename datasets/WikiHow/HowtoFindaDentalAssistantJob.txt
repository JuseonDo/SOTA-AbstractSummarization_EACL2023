If you enjoy working with a diverse group of people, helping others and are good with details and performing multiple tasks, you will probably enjoy serving as a dental assistant.;
, Each one has different training and testing requirements. Some have no formal requirements. Research and find the best dental assistant training.


Many community colleges offer programs in dental assisting that only take about a year to complete. They include laboratory, classroom and hands-on clinic training.



These credentials can be obtained at a school offering an accredited dental assisting program recognized by the Commission on Dental Accreditation or CODA.
Programs endorsed by CODA offer reputable training and are highly recognized in the field of dentistry for high standards in training.



Highlight all coursework you have completed, and list any relevant experience and hands-on training you have had in the dental assistant field.



Online job searches and local newspapers are great ways to start your job search. Networking at your school with teachers and other students can also give you job leads.



Talk with the interviewing dentist and his or her staff about why you want to work in the dental assistant field, and why your dental assistant training makes you a good candidate for the job being offered.



Be polite and show appreciation, and ask to be informed of their decision.
