, Click on it.
 Another set of list will come out.
 You will see two boxes.


Click the first one and change the immediate language back to your preferred language. A prompt will appear. It simply means you should restart your phone for the change to take effect.
The second box is your locale. You can change the locale language to your preferred language. That is, if you format your phone next time, it won't change back to Russian or so. Restart your phone for the change to take effect.
 You can change the language without hard booting and losing stuff.
