 Since fleece doesn't fray, you can gather it right at the edge for a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance., Remember that this will be on the inside of your robe., Sew down each side on your sewing machine., Pin it into place.,

If you want to have a robe/blanket, sometimes referred to as a "snuggie," you can leave the back open so that you can wear the robe backwards when you are sitting in a chair or lying on a couch.
 Cut a piece that is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.

If 1 piece of side fabric is not long enough, sew 2 pieces together. Test the fleece band around your waist to see if you can wrap it around you and tie it comfortably.
 Mark a place on the back of each side of your waist with a pin. When you take the robe off you can measure to make sure the pins are at the same height on your robe., Hand sew these loops onto the places where you have attached the pins. This will help to hold your waist band in place when it is not tied., You may want to fold in the edges of the arm holes, neck hole and bottom and sew a hem. You can also do a blanket stitch around all the open sides of the robe in a contrasting thread.
