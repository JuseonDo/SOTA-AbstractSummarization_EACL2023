 x 1/2" PVC piping (found at a home improvement store, e.g. home depot)
2–4.5 feet (0.6–1.4 m). fun/pool noodle or PVC insulation a.k.a. "closed cell foam"
packaging tape or duct tape
open cell foam (e.g. couch cushion, sponge, sleeping bag padding)
grip tape optional;
, File both ends of the pipe so that neither end is rough. Place the penny flat against the tip of the boffer (opposite of where the handle will be) and tape it in place. The penny has a greater surface area than the tip of the PVC and will make it less likely for the PVC to poke through the padding.
, Leave at least an inch of space in between the end of the pipe and the end of the foam as a safety measure.
 When you reach the end, make sure to put a chunk of open-cell foam (about 4"x4") onto the tip of the boffer, and tape over. Do this as many times as it takes to cover the foam.
