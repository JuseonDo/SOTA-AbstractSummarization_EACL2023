 Find out how many days you will be on vacation and if you will able to do the laundry.


If you won't be able to do laundry on your trip, pack 1 shirt, 1 pair of underwear, and 1 pair of socks for everyday of your trip (remember the day that you fly home). Also pack 2-3 pairs of pants for every week of your trip.
If you will be able to do laundry, pack enough clothes to last you in between laundry days.;
, Pack these in a zip lock bag, so that everything will be contained if any bottles or packaging explodes. Pack anything that you use everyday: toothpaste, hairbrush, face wash, etc.
 This includes swim trunks, extra shoes, and any tickets or papers that you might need for later in your trip.
 This can be a suitcase or duffle bag, depending on the amount of things you need to pack.
 This can be a backpack or a small duffle bag. Be sure to include:


Any travel documents that you might need. This includes tickets, a passport, a photo id, and travel visas. Check with your parents to see exactly what you should bring.
A music player. Remember to bring headphones and any chargers that you'll need.
A small pillow. This can help tremendously when you are trying to fall asleep in a car, train or airplane.
A book, magazine or homework.
Candy, chips, crackers, or fruit. You don't need that much; about two handfuls of one of the above is fine. Try to pack something that you like: when you're on a long flight or stuck on a train, this might be one of the few treats you can find.


For Carry on you can use Duffle bags, messenger bags , Suitcase and the best for teen boys, Backpacks.
