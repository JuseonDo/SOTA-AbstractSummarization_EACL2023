@article
, Make sure they don't have a history of bullying or using younger people, or a reputation for unsafe behavior that could get you in trouble or reflect badly on you.
 Think about what makes you cool and worthy of hanging out with this person. Don't adapt your interests or style to this person's whims.
 Both love horseback riding? Both excel in art?

,, Say "Hey, I heard you like fishing. Do you want to go with me and my friend this weekend?" This lets you establish a connection (even if they can't hang out with you right away, you have something to talk about) and shows you're fun and have something to contribute.
 (No sucking up!) Say: "I saw the still-life painting you did in Art class. Wow! Those peaches you drew looked so real and delicious it made me hungry!".
, Say "Me and a bunch of people from the soccer team are going to get pizza on Friday. Want to come?"

,, Get to know their friends as well.
 An older teen can be a great source of advice. Plus, you allow them to feel cool and knowledgeable.
 Suggest activities, find cool music, or introduce your friend to new people. And be sure to have this person's back like any other good friend.
 Your new friend's established buddies may think you'll be "whiney" or a "baby" because of your age. Keep a cool head, roll with good-natured ribbing (and don't hesitate to dish out some well-intentioned jokes!), and handle any tough situations as rationally as you can.
