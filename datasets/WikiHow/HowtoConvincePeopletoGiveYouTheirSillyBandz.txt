 If they're your friends, they'll usually give you at least one just for fun. Ask around your big collectors especially, since the people who have hundreds of them certainly shouldn't mind handing over one or two.;
, If you see someone (even if you're not really friends with them) giving away Silly Bandz to people, don't be afraid to ask, "Can I have one too, please?" If they say no, that's okay. Sometimes people will say yes!

, For most people, there's at least 1 Silly Band in the pack that's just ugly to them. If there is, ask for it! Sometimes they'll give you all 3 designs of that ugly band!

, Sometimes people will want a band so badly, they'll give you 2 of their bands for it!

,,, Your friends will do this for you, and then you can keep it!
