, If a hose is not practical, such as in a campground or RV Park, use a bucket of water and the micro fiber mitt or micro fiber cloth. Apply water from the bottom of the vehicle up to avoid streaks.
 Wash your car first, and the wheels last; this will lessen the chance of picking up debris that will scratch your vehicle. Rinse your mitt or cloth often. If you don’t have a micro fiber mitt, use a regular micro fiber cloth. The bugs and specks of dirt will come loose from the finish with very little rubbing. If some spots don’t come free on the first go-around, come back to them after the entire quarter has been washed.
, This will spread the water into a fine film that will not spot the finish. You can also hit any missed spots with the damp micro fiber cloth.
 You will completely polish and shine the finish, chrome and glass.
