@article
 Use a mat that you no longer want; if you can't find one, look in a charity store for throwaway mats. Keep the rest of the mat in your craft cupboard for other uses.
, Trace it again on the smooth side to create the insole for the opposite foot. Cut out this insole. Now you have both a right and a left foot insole.
 This means that you'll have a total of five cut-outs for each foot.
 Place the textured side up.
 Glue a little, then press. Then glue a little more, and press. If you try to glue the whole layer at once, it'll start to dry before you push the layers together.
 Once dry, you have new insoles!
