 Cook the onion until it's translucent.
 Saut√© the mushrooms with the onions. Continue to cook these ingredients together until the onions are caramelized.
 Then, add 1/2 cup of milk and stir the ingredients together until the milk is absorbed. Turn up the heat to medium-high as you continue to stir the ingredients.
 Add up to 1/2 cup more milk to the risotto, until it's nice and creamy. If it's ready as it is, then don't add more milk. Cook the risotto for at least 15-20 minutes.
 Spoon the risotto into a bowl and top it with 1/2 a cup of grated Parmesan cheese.
