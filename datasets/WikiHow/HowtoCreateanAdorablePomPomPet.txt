 pick your favorite yarn and decide how big you want your new friend to be. For a small pet you should use about 10 feet (3.0Â m) of yarn, 15-30 for a medium sized pet, and about 40-45 for a large pet. Also cut about two feet of yarn to tie him/her together.;
, Do not wrap too tightly or you might hurt yourself!

, You'll need to do this pretty tightly so your pom pom pet doesn't fall apart. It is recommended that you ask a friend to help you, unless you can tie it tightly by yourself.
 His fur will most likely look uneven, so give him a trim so he's neat and circular. As for the long pieces that came from when you tied him, you should cut those so they're the same length as the rest of his fur.
 You're not done yet! Your little buddy still can't see! So, grab some googly eyes (or be creative and make your own eyes), and glue or tape them on! Glue will stick better, but you will also have to wait a while before his eyes are dry, so if you can't wait, just tape them on!

, To do this, put some pipe cleaners in! (This is not needed though, because pom pom pets can cling to things and maneuver without arms and legs.)

,, Now you have created your own adorable little pom pom pet!
