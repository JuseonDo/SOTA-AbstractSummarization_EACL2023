 Make sure your baking sheet full of wings will be at the mid-way point in your oven so that the heat will flow evenly around the pan while the wings are baking.

,, This isn’t strictly necessary, but putting the wings on the rack will keep the meat out of the grease that forms while they are baking.
 If you prefer, you can snip the tips of the wings off with kitchen shears and cut the wings into 2 parts. (Discard the tips.)








,, Press the towels down firmly to soak up the rinse water.
, (If necessary, repeat this process until the wings are thoroughly dry.)








,, Make sure every piece is thoroughly coated with the oil and spices.
 Try not to let them overlap so that they cook evenly.
 If some of them don’t look like they have enough coating, you can swipe them around the bottom of the mixing bowl to add some extra coating.
 Check on the wings after 50 minutes to make sure they are not overcooking and drying out.
