, Using the knife, slice down the middle of the pods and split them open. Scrape out the pulp onto a clean surface and keep the leftover pods.
, Once it starts boiling or bubbles start forming, remove the saucepan and its contents from the heat.
 Pick out the vanilla pods when the cream has finished cooling.
 Whisk together until the yolks break up completely and the mixture changes to a slightly lighter color.
 If you incorporate the cream in too quickly, the eggs may cook. Don't rush this step!

,,, This set-up is known as a bain marie.
 When ready, they'll be set on the edges but "jiggly" at the center.
 Remove the crèmes brûlées from the oven when baked, and, taking great care as the ramekins will be very hot, transfer them out of the bain marie and onto a cooling rack. Allow them to cool to room temperature.
, Make sure that the sugar coats the crème brûlée evenly. An uneven coat of sugar will make the caramelization harder.
 Don't caramelize it for more than roughly 8-10 seconds. If you over-heat it, the sugar will turn black.


If you don't have a blowtorch, move the wire rack in the oven to its highest position and turn on the broiler. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet and place them underneath the broiler, twisting the ramekins often for even browning.
 Letting them refrigerate for any longer may allow the sugar to dissolve back into the custard. This step is optional, as some prefer to caramelize the sugar immediately before serving.
