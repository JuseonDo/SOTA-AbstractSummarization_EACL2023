 This is best done after the first frost.
 Scrape off dirt and any hairy parts.
, Add small amounts of vinegar for each batch, just enough to help the processing (about 1 tablespoon of vinegar per cup of horseradish pieces). Process or blend until pulped.


The horseradish can make your eyes water when you remove the lid from the blender or processor.
 Fill with vinegar.


Or, fill ice cube trays with the processed horseradish and simply freeze (don't add any further vinegar). Add to freezer bags once the tray pieces freeze, and date and label the bags.
 Store in a dark, dry place or in the fridge.
