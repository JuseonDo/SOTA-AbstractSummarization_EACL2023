Breath in as deeply as you can, hold, and let out the air as slowly as you can; repeat 5 times or until you are calm.;
,


Now imagine you just finishing your speech and all of your peers or coworkers clapping, impressed by your wise words. Now open your eyes. You can also search for other breathing exercises on the internet.
 Then practice it again. Have you done that? Now repeat. Practice in front of your friend(s), family member(s), mirror, pet, and any other audience that you do not feel threatened by. If you know you have practiced extensively, you will be more confident when it is time for you to present your speech.
 Odds are, if they know you are worried, they will want you to succeed and you can look at them if you are nervous about making awkward eye contact.
, Post this in a notebook, on a fridge, in a calendar, on a personal bulletin board, or in a workspace. You can read this whenever you are discouraged or have to speak again. It will help you remember that you did it before and you can do it again!

, Leave the past in the past. You should take your mistakes and apply them to the next time you speak publicly.
