@article
 If there is a design on one side, place that side facing down.









Note that you can use either a square or a rectangular napkin for this step.
Napkins of stiffer material may be easier to work with.
 Make the rolls relatively tight.









If you are using a rectangular napkin, make your rolls so that they run the long way.
To be sure that your rolls are equal halves, make a light crease through the center of the napkin for reference by folding it in half and unfolding. (If you're using a rectangular napkin, make the crease so that it runs the longer length of the cloth.)

Holding the napkin lengthwise in front of you, fold it about two-thirds of the way back on itself.
Next, take the part you've folded over and fold it back on itself once again, this time in half.
 A hardcover book or plate will do the trick.









When the minute is up, remove the weight.
 If you want to make a uniform swan heart, use a napkin with the same design. If you prefer to mix things up, choose a napkin with a different pattern or color.
 It may take a little time to figure out the right positioning for your swans to stay upright. If you're having trouble, try adjusting how much you bend their necks and where you place their heads together.









Keep in mind that very smooth table surfaces may cause the swans to slide away from one another; try to place them on a tablecloth, placemat, or other surface that offers a bit of friction.
