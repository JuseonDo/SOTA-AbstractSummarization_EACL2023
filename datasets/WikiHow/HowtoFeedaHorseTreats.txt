 Every week, feed him a different treat and watch how he acts. Common favorite treats are cookies, carrots, and pitted cherries, but like people, every horse is different.;
, Here is a list of treats that horses enjoy eating: Pitted Dates, raisins, sugar cubes, hay cubes, apple pieces, carrot pieces, sunflower seeds (With or without shells), peppermints, naturally flavored cough drops (Believe it or not!)

, Hand-feeding encourages nipping and biting and, as we all know, nobody wants that.
 It is proven unhealthy, just like if you eat a bunch of Hershey bars in one day, your horse may get sick.
