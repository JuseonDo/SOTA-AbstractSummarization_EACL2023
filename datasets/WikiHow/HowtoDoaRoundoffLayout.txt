 A standing tuck will not help you in learning a layout because you can't do a standing layout without piking.
 Your roundoff tuck should be extremely long. Not because your tuck is long but because your roundoff is reaching. If you are 4 feet in height, your roundoff should be at least 5' in length. This will maximize power that will go into the layout., Make sure your legs come down in a hollow position and land slightly behind you., Position your arms so they reach for the bar above your head. Try spotting the wall you came from when you set., Just like the tuck, you want to make sure your roundoff is powerful because that's where your power comes from. And the bigger the block from your shoulder the more power you'll have.,

Make sure you are still spotting the wall.


Do not put your arms by your sides. Grab the bar that's way up there and hold on as you pull your stomach to you hands using your core.
 Then hold this form (which is why you get maximum height with the roundoff). As you are holding this form, you should be looking at your toes. Make sure you don't pike your legs down., When you see the ground where your feet will land and not a moment before or after, your arms will got out to sides to form a T like position with your body. Make sure you bend legs on landing., Now you have learned a layout, the only thing you need to do to twist is instead of arms on each side; put both arms to one side and look at them.
