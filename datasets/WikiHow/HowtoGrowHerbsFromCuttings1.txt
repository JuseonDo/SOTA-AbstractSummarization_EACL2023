 Many herbs slow down growth when temperatures begin to drop, so cuttings taken during cooler weather may not root.;
, The cutting is not likely to root strongly while flowering because the plant's energy is focused on the flowers, not the root. If you do take a cutting from an herb that is flowering, remove the flowers from the cutting before propagating.
 The new growth on most herbs is lighter in color and higher up on the plant. The new growth is most likely to root because the stems aren't as hard.
 If a plant has been heavily fertilized to stimulate growth, it is unlikely a cutting will take root. Rather, take cuttings from healthy plants that are growing steadily without the need for excessive fertilizer.
 Well saturated plants are likely to produce healthy cuttings.
