 You never know, you might find something you relate to like : if you're staying at a hotel with a swimming pool and you love swimming you could stay in the pool for hours!;
, Also check out the website of the interesting places because usually they will show more information.
 Eg ; If you're going to the Czech Republic in the winter and pack for warm weather you will be wearing a swimsuit in 2 feet (0.6 m) tall snow!

, If you want to go see a movie and you use £ instead of a US $ you will not be allowed into the movie!

, Try to stay away from those areas.
 Bring your own toothbrushes and hair products and soap! If you forget this step or usually don't do it, it won't matter because most hotels provide things like that (But not toothbrushes or toothpastes).
 Don't go around dark alleyways at night alone. If you need to go through one at night to do shopping or something take a friend and something like a big rock to throw at in case someone attacks you.
 If you do go with friends or family choose a day where you get to pick what you want to do! You're on holiday too not just them.
