@article
 It is suggested you allow the handgun to remain pointed in a safe direction for several minutes before attempting to clear the jam in the event it is a delayed fire, and not a jam. For rounds that fired and left the empty shell casing stuck in the chamber, this step can be omitted.;
,,, Here are examples of potential ammunition problems that can cause jams:


Old, corroded, bent, or malformed ammunition.
Ammunition that has been incorrectly reloaded.
Ammunition that has been exposed to moisture or extreme temperatures.
Ammunition that is the incorrect caliber or style for your weapon.
 Yes, you can probably clear a simple jam and continue shooting your handgun, but in the long run, if there are either mechanical issues or underlying problems with the gun, you might be putting yourself or others at risk by doing so. A trip to a qualified gunsmith might be money well spent.
