having organization be a part of their grade or give graded 'notebook checks' to make sure their binders are neat.

@summary
instead of lowering their grade, keep the student inside for recess or give detention.

@summary
tell the student(s) that you will call home and expect their parents' to punish them accordingly.

@summary
if you can't read their handwriting, lower their grade or give them no credit.

 If you do this, have reasonable expectations based on age, and grade evenly across the board.
 This works with limited success, depending on the amount of students and whether or not they care. If the whole elementary school class continues to be messy, tell them that they will miss recess - the whole class. Detention may or may not prompt the student into action.
 Follow through. Explain the situation to the student(s) parents' and ask that they help in your mission to help their child get organized. Use good phone manners and don't blame the parents.
 Once again, this depends on the age. Children just learning to write cannot have perfectly legible calligraphy. Once students get into Middle School you should expect to be able to read their writing.
