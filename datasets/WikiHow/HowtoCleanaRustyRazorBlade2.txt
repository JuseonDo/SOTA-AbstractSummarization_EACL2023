 You’ll want to have a few clean, soft towels on hand, along with some rubbing alcohol and a handful of cotton balls. You’ll use these items at the end to sterilize your blade.
 There is no need to use soap or cleaning products for this. Running it under plain tap water is all you need to do. Make sure that you rinse the blade very well, getting into any nooks and crannies.
 Drop the razor blade into the bowl and allow it to soak for a minimum of 30 seconds. You can leave it in the juice for several minutes, if you like.


Make sure there’s enough juice in the bowl so that the blade is totally submerged in it.
 After doing so, you can use the lemon half to scrub directly on the razor blade. The acid in the juice, coupled with the grit of the sea salt, will work to clean the rust from the blade.
 Run the blade under the tap to rinse it clean of any remaining pulp and salt. Examine the blade for any rust spots that haven’t been cleared up.


Repeat the steps if any of the rust is stubbornly remaining behind.
Rust can spread, so make sure to get it all.
 After you’ve removed all of the rust from the blade, gently blot it on a clean towel to get rid of any residual moisture, which is one of the main culprits of rust formation. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe the blade to sterilize it. Allow the blade to air dry on a towel.


Once it’s completely dry, store the blade away from moisture, either outside the bathroom or in a small ziplock bag.Always blot the blade dry with a clean towel after you use it.
