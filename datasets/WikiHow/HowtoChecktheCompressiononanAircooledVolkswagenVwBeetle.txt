a 13/16-inch spark plug socket.let the vw idle until the engine is completely warmed up.

@summary
turn off the engine and remove the spark plug connectors from each spark plug.remove all the spark plugs and block the carburetor throttle so that it is fully opened.thread the compression gauge into a cylinder making sure that the pressure release button has been pushed and the reading is at 0.

@summary
crank the engine for about 2 seconds and write down the highest reading from the gauge.

@summary
recheck cylinders with low compression readings by injecting approximately 10cc of engine oil into the cylinder through the spark plug hole.

@summary
return the spark plugs.reattached the spark plug wires.

A ratchet (3/8-inch drive).
A 3-inch extension, 3/8-inch drive to reach cylinders #1 and #3.
A universal, 3/8-inch drive.
A 6-inch length of rubber breather hose, 1/2-inch ID.;

Mark each wire with masking tape so you can put them back on the correct plugs later.

Be sure to turn the engine over six to eight times, same for each cylinder.
It is helpful to have a friend who can crank the engine.
Compression readings should be high compression (over 100 pounds) and relatively uniform among the cylinders (within 5 pounds). Variations from cylinder to cylinder should be no more than 14 to 20 pounds.


If the compression reading increases a little, the problem is probably worn, broken, or poorly seated piston rings.
If the compression reading remains the same, leaking or damaged valves may be at fault.


Use the 6" rubber breather hose as an extension to hand-thread the plug into its hole.
Turn the spark plug a turn or so to ensure it is not cross threaded.
