, This may take some time. If you do not have a Nintendo DS Lite, you must order the edition for the Original-Style Nintendo DS Console.
 If you have ordered the original-style Nintendo DS model and have a Nintendo DS Lite, the Memory Expansion Pak will stick out of the console. DON'T Force it in. This is normal. The DS Lite model will NOT work with the original-style DS console.
 Press it in until you hear it click within the console.
 If you have the Original-style Nintendo DS, there will be a power button in the console. If you have a Nintendo DS Lite, there is a switch on the side.
 If you have Auto-Start, skip this step. DON'T remove the Game Card from the console while using the console!
