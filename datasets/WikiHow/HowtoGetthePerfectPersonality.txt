@article
 Are you outgoing, laid-back, friendly, funny, shy, etc. And whatever category you fit in, how are you liked? Do you like your current personality position? If you want to change from one to another you must think about these things.;
, If other people can't be themselves, then neither can you.
 Whether that means wearing more black, or popping your collar, you have to feel like that personality before you become it.
 If you're going for that stuck-up preppy, hard-to-get kind of person, stop. Right now, people just think that's shallow, and they will not want to be around you.
 Just go with the flow, and don't create a fuss.
 People will want to get to know you.
,, People also prefer the real you.
