@summary
have the child learn (and memorize) the basic addition facts.

@summary
,

@summary
write out a math problem with two digits on the top and bottom.

@summary
ask the child to answer the units column first, placing both numbers in the correct (lower) positions.

@summary
ask the child to answer the tens column next.

@summary
tell the child that the problem is not finished.

@summary
explain that some addition still remains.

@summary
make certain that the child is comfortable with this before proceeding.

@summary
tell the child that, instead of writing the "1" under the tens digit, they are to place the "1" over the "tens" column.

@summary
,

@summary
ask the child to add the "1" to the top number of the "tens" column; then add the bottom number to that sum.
@article
, Draw a line between the "units" and the "tens" column to help align and use "place values" in columns. It is not important for your child to already know how to do two column addition.
 Do not have them put a "1" over the numbers, yet.
 Make certain the child places the digit(s) in the correct position (no digit should be in the units column.) If they are confused, cover up the units column. Have the child write the number(s) underneath the number already written in the "tens" column from the "units" column addition.
 Review what you have completed so far.


If you were using the example above, you might say, "We're almost done. You did seven plus five equals twelve. Good. Four plus three equals seven. Correct. Notice that the four and the three are in the tens position, so you are really adding forty and thirty."

, Have the child bring the amount in the units column down to the bottom. Point to the numbers in the "tens" column and ask the child to add them up.
 By now, the child should already be familiar with the commutative law of addition or (at least) know that the order of addition is unimportant.
, Tell the child that this is a shortcut we call "carrying", and more commonly called "regrouping" in classrooms today.
