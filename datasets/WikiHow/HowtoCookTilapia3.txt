 Here's what you'll need to make broiled tilapia:


1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup softened butter
3 tbsp. mayonnaise
2 tbsp. lemon juice
1/4 tsp. dried basil
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
1/8 tsp. onion powder
1/8 tsp. celery salt
2 lbs. tilapia fillets

,, You can also line it with aluminum foil instead.
 Mix together ½ cup of Parmesan cheese, ¼ cup of softened butter, 3 tbsp. of mayonnaise, and 2 tbsp. of lemon juice. Mix the ingredients until you’ve created a smooth, creamy mixture.
 Season the creamy mixture with ¼ tsp. of dried basil, ¼ tsp. of ground black pepper, 1/8 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/8 tsp. of celery salt. Mix the seasonings well with the creamy mixture and set it aside.
 Place 2 lbs. of tilapia fillets on the prepared pan so that they cover the whole pan and do not overlap.
 First, broil them a few inches from the heat for 2-3 minutes. Then, flip them over and broil them for 2-3 more minutes. When you’re done, remove the fillets from the oven.
 Use a spoon to layer on the mixture.
 Broil them until the Parmesan mixture is browned and the fish flakes easily with a fork. Be careful not to overcook it by making the mixture too rubbery or burned.
 Enjoy this broiled tilapia while it’s nice and warm. You can serve it on its own, or with some brown rice, asparagus, or a variety of other side dishes.
