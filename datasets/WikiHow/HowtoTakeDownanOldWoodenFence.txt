 Check with the zoning department in your town to make sure the fence doesn’t straddle property lines. If you remove a fence that straddles your property line, your neighbor can sue you for property damage. It’s also a good idea to get your neighbor’s permission in writing.;
, Most fences have either 4’ (1,219.2 mm) or 8’ (2,438.4 mm) sections between each set of fence posts.
Put each section of fence you remove in a stack for later disposal.
Saw the fence posts off at the base if you don’t plan to reuse them.
 It isn’t strictly necessary if you don’t plan to erect another fence, but most homeowners want the footings removed. Here are several ways you can remove the footings:


Dig next to the footing until you get to the bottom of the post. Work a crowbar underneath the bottom and pop the footing out. This method is much easier if you have someone help you.
Bust up the concrete footing with a sledgehammer; this is relatively easy because the inside of the footing consists of a 4x4 piece of (usually rotted) wood.
, Check with your local landfill to see if there are any disposal restrictions. Some jurisdictions may allow curbside pickup with your regular trash, but regulations may require you to bundle the wood into manageable pieces and tie them up with twine.
