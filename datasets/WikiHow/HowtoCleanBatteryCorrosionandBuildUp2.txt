Mild corrosion: On the traditional shiny terminals, this usually shows up as a dark dull spot.

Build up: In extreme cases, you may see a crusty build-up. If the build-up is significant, the solution is a bit more tricky.
,, Don't be alarmed if there's a fizzing reaction. That's perfectly natural.
 If that still doesn't remove the corrosion, you can gently rub the area with fine sandpaper to remove the corroded bits before trying the vinegar again.
 And remember to remove them before putting your camera away next time.
, That's battery acid which has leaked from the battery and it can burn your skin.


If you do touch it, rinse your hands off thoroughly with warm soapy water before getting them close to your eyes or any mucous membranes. Let the water run vigorously because the acid will likely become active as it's hydrated. Fast-running water will help rinse it off before it starts to burn you.
 This would be used in the best case scenario.
 Remove as much as you can in this manner.
 You will almost definitely get hissing and fizzing, as well as the creation of salt and water. If the battery casing is not waterproof (it generally isn't), you may want to perform this step over a sink with the battery case facing down so that any generated water or salt will drip out.
 Distilled water is better in the long run to prevent build-up, but tap water won't cause significant problems in this situation.
 Ensure that everything is dry before putting the batteries in. If necessary, leave the battery sitting out overnight to let any remaining water get out.
