If the trout is fresh, use a gutting knife or other sharp knife to gut it. Remove the trout's gills and entrails, as well as the blood line along its backbone.
If you are using frozen trout, remove the trout from the freezer and allow it to defrost slowly in the fridge. Once it's thawed, use a gutting knife or other sharp knife to cut off its head and tail.
Wash the trout to remove any residue that could compromise flavor.;

You can make brine by combining the water, salt, brown sugar, and other seasonings in a bowl. Soak the trout in it for 1 hour then remove the trout and dry it on a paper towel.



Use woods such as pecan, alder, oak or apple for a mild smoked trout flavor. For a stronger smoked flavor, consider hickory or mesquite wood.
, If you're making more than one smoked trout, leave plenty of space between each fish so the smoke touches all sides of each fish evenly.
