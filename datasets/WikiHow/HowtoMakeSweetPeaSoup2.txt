 Use a fork to swab the butter all over the pan. It should take about thirty seconds or less to melt. Pour in your chopped onion pieces into the frying pan and have it brown for about three to four minutes.
 Stir in the rest of the ingredients: the peas, sugar, mint, salt, and extra seasonings for your taste. Have it cook for about 5 minutes so the peas and broth can heat up.
 Pour soup in a blender or food processor. Close using a lid and start blending slowly and then quickly on high. If needed, cover lid with a towel to avoid spills or messes.
 Once done, insert pea soup into bowls, tea cups, or mugs using a ladle. Garnish with desired ingredients or with lemon juice and extra seasonings if needed.
