 If there isn't a god skip the next step, if there is skip step about what will you worship.;
,, Will you worship anything? Why will you worship this? Why do you believe in it?

, explain exactly how.
 Of course there can be multiple goals or no goals at all.
 Will you celebrate Christmas, Chanukah, Valentine's Day, birthdays, or new holidays? Why do you celebrate these holidays? How do you celebrate each holiday? What is the holidays name? Example: Christmas - the birthday of Christ- Christmas, tree, cookies, Santa, presents, etc.
 Think about clothing, food, school, work, play, hobbies, manners, and anything else affected. Now some things might not be affected, others might only be slightly affected, some might be completely affected. In some religions everything will be affected, completely or slightly. In others, nothing except worship will change. In some, you can change aspects, but you don't have to. In others, you must. Some are sort of loose about these changes, others are very strict.
 Should they build a shrine(how?)? Should they pray? Should they meditate? Have you discovered a new way to worship? Make sure to give it a name and (in detail) how to do it. In religion, worship is very important. Where should worship be done? Does it matter where? Things to consider: where, when, how, who(mother, youngest daughter, everyone, does it matter?), be specific.
 Will you write one? What is in the scripture? What is the purpose of having of this scripture?

,, Get the word out. Tell everyone you can. Try to convert people and change close minded skeptics. Don't worry if some people shun you, and you don't convert everyone don't get put off by a few people.
