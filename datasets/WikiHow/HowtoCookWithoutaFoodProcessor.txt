 For shredded foods, most foods can be grated using a manual grater.


You can also use the grater for making fresh breadcrumbs.
Try to obtain a commercial grade food grater, as these are less likely to rust.;
, Take care using mandolins; always use the slicing handle they come with.
 Then slice again to make julienne like cuts on a smaller scale.

For crushing items such as biscuits or dry, stale bread for crumbs, use the same method, then sieve the crumbs through a colander or sieve to filter the fine crumbs, then crush the remaining coarse ones again.






An electric coffee mill can also be used to pulverize dry ingredients, such as herbs or grains. It should be cleaned thoroughly of coffee first, and and also after.
, Alternatively, press the foods through a clean fine mesh or sieve to make food like pâté.
 For making a dough such as pasta, pastry or bread, use a stiff whisk, table knife or fork. These can be used to combine ingredients to keep your hands clean. You will still need to knead by hand, however, for quickest results.







For a very smooth soup, mash until no visible chunks remain, then pour through a sieve, and press the remainder through the sieve using a spoon.
 This will enable quick chopping. A standard knife and board will suffice for most vegetables and fruits.
 This is the easiest, but you could also use a bunch of thin bamboo kebab sticks to simulate a whisk.


For churning, such as butter or ice cream, use a rotary whisk if you have one.
 This will give a unique mincemeat like consistency which is very hard to replicate by hand.


If such an item is still not available, then slice thinly, finely chop and crush with a pestle, potato masher, or knead it by hand until you reach a mince consistency.
Semi frozen meat can be grated to make a good mince like product. Take all suitable hygiene precautions.
