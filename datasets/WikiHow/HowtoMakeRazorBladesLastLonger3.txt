 You can make you blades last even longer with a quick sharpening. While you can't use a traditional sharpening tool on most modern razor blades, you can easily buff them with simple materials such as denim or even skin.
 The cross-fibers of the jeans do a bang-up job of both drying and sharpening the blades, keeping them pristine., Instead of using denim, you can actually sharpen your razor by rubbing it across your own forearm. Any time the blade begins to feel dull, as if it will soon need to be replaced, push it across your forearm, from wrist to elbow about 20 times. Make sure you push the blade in the opposite direction of how you would use it to shave.
