 This is a light-purple app with a white gear on it that's in the App Drawer. If you've recently backed up your saved data to Samsung Cloud, you can restore it from within your phone.
 It's near the bottom of the page., This option should be near the top of the page., It's below the "BACK UP AND RESTORE" heading., Doing so will select your photos as the only item to restore, which will leave the rest of your data untouched., It's at the bottom of the screen. Your photos from the latest cloud backup will begin restoring to your Samsung Galaxy.

This process may take a few minutes.
