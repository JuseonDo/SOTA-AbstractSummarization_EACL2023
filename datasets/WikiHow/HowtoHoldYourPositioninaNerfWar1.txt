@summary
first (assuming this is an outdoor nerf war), check out your surrounding area.

@summary
get these things between you and the direction the enemy will approach from.

@summary
if you haven't been spotted by the enemy yet, stay quiet.

@summary
if you have been spotted, try to make them think that you are ready for their attack and that there are more of you than there actually are.

@summary
set traps.
@article
 Look for anything that you can use for cover (something with a solid "wall" and no slits or holes large enough to allow a dart to pass): a bed, chair, box, bookshelf, pillow, etc.;
, Set them up so that the enemy will only be able to approach you one at a time, this way they won't be able to overwhelm you with their numbers.
 You can use surprise to your advantage when the time is right.
 Try, (supposing you have PLENTY of ammunition), shooting at them whenever they so much as peek at you, though be VERY careful not to be caught off-guard while you're reloading.
 Try making a trip line that releases something or shoots a dart at your opponents. Or you can put paintball traps in the area. Or anything else you can think of.
