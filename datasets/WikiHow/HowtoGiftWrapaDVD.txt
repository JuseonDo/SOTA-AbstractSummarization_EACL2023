 If it is a multi-disc set, the box may be thicker, so allow for extra paper at the top and the bottom.;
, Use a small piece of tape to stick the right side of the paper to the box. Fold the left side of the paper over the box so it meets the other side in the middle, and secure it with tape.
 Then, fold the top flap down, so it is flat against the box bottom, and fold the bottom flap up, so it covers the other flap. Secure with tape.
 Repeat Step 3, pushing the small right and left sides of the paper flat against the box to create two angled flaps sticking off the bottom of the box. Fold the top flap down, so it is flat against the box bottom, and fold the bottom flap up, so it covers the other flap. Secure with tape.
, Some bows and gift cards have their own adhesive, while others will need to be stuck to the box with tape.
