 A lot of the wholewheat will stay in the sifter; this can be pushed through a sieve or simply added back in as is, whichever you prefer. (The sieve pushing will make it finer, not doing this will leave a rougher texture.)

, Mix in well.
 During this time, the gluten in the flour will lose its elasticity, so that the dough won't shrink when baked.
