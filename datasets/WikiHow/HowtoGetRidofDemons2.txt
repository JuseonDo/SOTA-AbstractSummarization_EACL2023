 If your house is a mess, it will create a dirty unpleasant environment which will benefit the demon's manifestations.
 Before dealing with any spirit, skeptical or not, it is much safer if you have some sort of psychic protection to reduce the chances of demonic possession and getting hurt.
 If you feel like there's something odd or weird about any object and it doesn't feel good, follow your gut and get rid of it.
 Prepare your area and create the spiritual atmosphere with anything you'd prefer. Such as incense, candles, crystal and whatever you'd like to purify your space. Smudging is a powerful method used worldwide.
 This is the most important step. You can perform any ritual but you need to be sure that you are not completely alone; that you know exactly what you're doing.
 Do not take the spirit for fool. It can outsmart you and come back. When it does, you might want help from professionals.
 It scares the Devil, greatly, when the Rosary is prayed upon and surely will defend you from demons.
