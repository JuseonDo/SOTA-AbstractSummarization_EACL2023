 A plain metal one should work the best, especially if it has a big hook with thin but strong metal.


Before you buy a crochet hook, take a good look at your shower drain, so you won't buy too big of a crochet hook.
If you can't buy a crochet hook, just straighten a thick paper clip, fold up one tip of the wire, and use that instead.;
, All these things are optional, but if you use them, you won't have to handle anything gooey and unidentifiable.
 Put a towel on the floor of the shower if it's wet or if you need padding for your knees.



Keep repeating this motion until all the hair is removed.
, Loosen (counterclockwise) the two screws, being careful not to drop them into the drain. Then, remove the drain cover and clean out any matter that is clinging to it. Use the crochet hook, a long, thin pair of pliers, or a hook improvised from a wire coat hanger to reach as far into the drain as you can to dislodge any clogged pieces. Try to pull the clogs out and avoid pushing them further in. For clogs further down, you may need to use a plumber's snake to get them out.
