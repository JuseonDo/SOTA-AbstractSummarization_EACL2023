@summary
understand that most agp video cards have a standard 4-pin molex connector.

@summary
to plug this type of connector in correctly, be sure that the molex connector is oriented with the beveled edges facing the correct way.

@summary
]recognize that there are other types of connectors as well.

@summary
follow the same installation for the pci-express.

@summary
gently push it into position until the locking tab secures the connector in place.

@article
 This is the same type of connector found on most home IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM and Hard Disk Drives.;
, These are here to prevent a user from inverting or putting the plug in backwards by mistake. Do not force the plug, just apply gentle pressure (sometimes a slight wiggling motion is necessary) and press the connector into the receptacle until it is firmly seated.
 More recently, another connector for PCI-Express video cards requires more power than the 4 pin Molex can provide. As a result, this expanded Molex in the photo is required.
 Orient the connector so that the tab is facing the same direction as the receptacle. As you can see in the above image, there is a locking tab that keeps this connector in place.
