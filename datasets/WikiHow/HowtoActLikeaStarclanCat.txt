start reading up.

@summary
you know how starclan cats give prophecies?,

@summary
start with simple prophecies, not like the professional ones that spottedleaf gives, and make them easy to fulfill unless you're trying to do a professional clan.

@summary
read books that are mainly about starclan, and look for details about starclan.

@summary
don't forget, you don't have to always do prophecy-related stuff.

@summary
get a warrior name and clan.

@summary
don't use a ridiculous warrior names like grabbypan or collarbiter.

@summary
starclan cats usually have small stars in their fur.

@summary
don't say shortcut words like "i'll, don't, c'mon," and all that stuff.

@summary
always speak kind, loyal, and mysteriously.

@summary
don't ever speak twolegspeak!

 You can't be a StarClan cat correctly unless you know what they do.;
, Start giving strange mysterious prophecies that you will later fulfill or you will plan for a friend or family member to fulfill. Or the person can do it. You can trick them into doing it.
 Don't make it all unrealistic.
 Use these details and do whatever the StarClan cats do in the stories.
 You can just talk mysteriously like a StarClan cat or tell stories about your former Clan and how they are doing now. Of course to do that you will need a Clan.
 There are many resources you can get a warrior name from, and you can either choose a Clan or take the Clan quiz at warriors.com.
 Read some books and notice that cats usually have nature-related names and many warriors have "claw" or "pelt" as a last name, also see that medicine cats usually don't have "claw" in their last names, contrary to a warrior's name. Learn what names are appropriate or not, and what would be odd to put in a name. For example, 'Humanheart' would be inappropriate because the cats don't exactly know what a human is, instead they would use the term 'two-leg' but this name is also highly unrecommended. Don't make your name like a website username like Mangalover or Horseys101. That isn't a real warrior name, and people would think you were talking about some virtual game or something. Choose the name you like, not the one you don't like but the website chose for you.
 Draw a picture of the cat and visualize the cat with stars in his\her fur if you want, because when people ask "What does your cat look like?" if you don't describe the stars then people will think the cat isn't a StarClan cat.
 You need to say stuff like "You cannot defeat BloodClan unless you have the right power in your Soul, Firestar."

, If you are evil, you can always create a dark forest cat.
 Then other cats will think you are a Werecat!
