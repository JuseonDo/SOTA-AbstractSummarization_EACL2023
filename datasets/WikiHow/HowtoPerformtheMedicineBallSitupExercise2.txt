 Focus on doing so in a controlled manner, feeling each vertebra lift off the floor. At about 30˚ you'll feel as though you can't lift much further. Do your best to lift as high as you can pushing through your feet (don't bounce yourself up).



Once the partner catches the ball, slowly return to the starting position.
 Remember to rise up and down in a slow, controlled manner—each ascent and descent should last about 5 seconds.
