 There should be at least 12 loops on the top. For this method, it's easiest to use wide rickrack -- about the width of your thumb. Anything thinner won't lead to the desired results.
 You'll do this at the end of the rickrack, too, when you're finished making the flower.
 They should fold together like an accordion, your needle going in and out of each lower point of the material.


When you're finished with that, fold the end of the rickrack as you did in the beginning.
 This seals up the bunch of fabric. Pull it taut; you should be left with what looks like a circle.
 Hold the raw edges of the rickrack out of the way while you do this. Stitch across and around the flower to snug up the center, working on the backside of your brooch.


This will help keep the center together and, overall, make the brooch feel firmer and sturdier.
 Sew it into the center of your rickrack flower. Tie off the thread on the back of the brooch and cut.
 This will be the base of your brooch. Add a pin back to that circle of felt.


Place the pin near the top of the circle. Sewing it in the middle will cause the brooch to sag when wearing it.
 Conceal any frayed or unsightly edges under this felt circle as your sew.
