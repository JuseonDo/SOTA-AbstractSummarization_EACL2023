@summary
draw two horizontal curves across the sheet:  this will be most of the left side wing and part of the body.

@summary
,

@summary
draw an ovular shape on the right side: this will be the right wing.

@summary
draw an outline of the left side wing by splitting the wing into three parts: two rectangles and a circle.

@summary
draw a box between the left side wing and the right side wing, another box underneath it, and an upside down triangle on the top box: this will be the torso.

@summary
draw a downwards curve through the body: this is where the tail will be.

@summary
split the tail in three segments, three rectangles and a circle at the end.

@summary
run a small line across the first rectangle of the tail.

@summary
draw the outline of the legs using y-shapes.

@summary
finish drawing the legs.

@summary
draw five spikes in the positions shown on each of the circles at the ends of the wings and tail.

@summary
connect the spikes properly to the wings using the lines shown above.

@summary
now add the lines that connect the wings and tail properly to the body.

@summary
,

@summary
finally, you move onto the head.

@summary
draw two rectangles, similar to the drawing above, beginning from the end of the neck.

@summary
make yveltal's mane.

@summary
erase your guidelines.

@summary
,

@summary
add in the patterns on yveltal's body.

@summary
add color and shading to make yveltal look even better.

,,,,,  This will be the tail.,  This marks where the legs will be.,  This step is very simple. The Y-shapes show where the talons will be when you draw the legs. Make sure they are at each end of the line across the tail., The beginning of the leg is a circular shape that sends halfway down the line that leads to the Y-shapes. Use the remaining space between the circles and the y-shapes for the lower legs. then you can draw the talons using the Y-shapes to guide where they will be and how long the "toes" are.,  These are Yveltal's "Fingers.",  Add three spikes to the underside of the wings near the body.  These spikes are more akin to feathers.,,  Draw a short curve from the body towards the right wing.  Then add another curve under it to make it Yveltal's neck. These lines will be connected later when making Yveltal's head. Attempt to follow the sample above to avoid proportion problems.,  Add triangles to the rectangles to make Yveltal's horns.(The horns are the rectangles+the triangles.)  You can finish its face by drawing the beak with a downwards zigzag and connect it to the lower line that makes Yveltal's neck., Draw a curve from the tip of the triangle on Yveltal's chest to the top of the page.  Bring the same curve back down to the other side.  Reconnect this curve to the chest using these lines. This is should vaguely resemble a triangular shape. Be as free handed as you like when drawing Yveltal's mane, as the actual curves in the plumes are variable. Be sure to add feather spikes here and there to give a ruffled, unruly look.,, These are branch-like structures, so make them as harsh and jagged as you like. Ensure, however, that at the end of each limb, the branch splits into three., After that, your destruction bird is ready.
