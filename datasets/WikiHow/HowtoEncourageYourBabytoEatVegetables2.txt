 It may take some time for him to get used to the taste. Tell him "Just one bite" and get him used to trying them. You may even find at this point that he favors some vegetables over others.
 Don't let your frustration come out. He needs to see that even vegetables can be fun. At this stage of development, he needs a lot of positive attention. Be sure to compliment him when he tries or eats his vegetables.
 When something he likes (i.e., fruits) is served beside something he dislikes (i.e., vegetables) he will, over time, develop more positive feelings about the vegetables. This is very subtle and will take time to occur. Over time he will be more likely to eat that vegetable.
 Start giving him larger portions. The goal now is to get him to eat rather than simply taste. Don't reward him with smiles and praise as often for a single bite. Make him work harder for his reward.
 For example, you may give him an extra helping of fruit when he finishes his vegetables. A favorite dessert may also be a good motivational tool.


For this to be effective it must be consistent and quickly given. As soon as he eats the last bite he should be receiving the reward, if possible. Even before he can talk and communicate he will begin associating vegetables with praise and rewards.
Don't reward your child if he does not eat. You may be frustrated that the reward is "wasted" when you do not give it to him and it goes bad. Choose your rewards carefully to avoid this situation.
 Switch it up and see what else you can motivate him with. Try one different reward per meal to see what works.


Keep track of how much your baby likes each reward. Try to save the best rewards for the more disliked vegetables.
Add non-food rewards into the mix. Using only food as a reward may encourage your baby to overeat. Stick with healthy foods like fruits for food rewards, but start adding in favorite activities when your baby is old enough to understand.
