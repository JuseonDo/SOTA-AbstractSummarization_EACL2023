If you have a Samsung Galaxy, you can capture a screen by pressing and holding the Back button and then pressing the Home button. Your screenshots will then appear in the Gallery, in a separate folder called ScreenCapture. When done, send the screenshots to your PC.
, In the section "My Demos", click the "Create Demo" button. Select a frame for your demo (Google Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S, etc.) and give your demo a relevant name. The frame will be visible when the demo is viewed on a computer and not visible when viewed on a smartphone or tablet.
 You do this by clicking the button "Upload Screenshots" and selecting the files from your disk (multiple file upload is possible).
 When clicked, a hotspot directs the user to the next screen or any other screen of your demo.
