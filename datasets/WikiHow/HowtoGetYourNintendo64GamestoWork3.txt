 Do not lose these; place in a resealable bag and set aside.
 Undo these as well.
 Inside is a chipboard.
 Also remove the chipboard from the case.
, These games were not made to last so long, so the conductive gold etched into the board has faded away. After wiping all residue and ensuring the circuit area is clean, especially where the bottom pins are, it is time to prep the circuit writer pen.
 Cover and fill in all the pits and faded areas.


Ensure that you do not make two pins contact into each other, as the ink is conductive and it will cause a short circuit if done incorrectly.
 Once done, reassemble the game.
 The game should work without having to jam and push the cartridge into the console.
