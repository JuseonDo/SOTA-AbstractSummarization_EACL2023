 Get one that spans across two burners so you can do more than one at a time but it is up to you. They cost perhaps $20-$40 but if you like pita then it will quickly pay for itself. You can also cook other foods, like steak or pancakes on the griddle.

, Sift 2 1/2 cups of flour and the salt into a bowl.
 Knead it and add the flour slowly until it's elastic - about 10-15 minutes but it really depends on how fast you go.
 Smear it all around the dough until it is no longer sticky. Put a damp cloth over it and set it in a warm place for about an hour and a half. Dough should be doubled in bulk.
, The circles should be about 1/4-inch thick and about 7 inches (17.8 cm) in diameter. Sandwich the circles between floured cloths and let rise for about 20 minutes in a warm place. This seems like forever, but this is really only if you have time and want the taste (the second rise will improve the flavor).
 Then, oil the pita as little as possible. Wait for the grill to heat and put the pita on it.
 Take a peek and if it looks like it has the marks that you always wanted on your steak then time to flip. Again, you're looking for those marks. When both sides are nicely browned, the pita should be done.
 (These are really good if you grill a few fresh pineapple slices and put them on vanilla ice cream along with the dessert pita.)
