When stitching these two pieces together, keep the sc row at the top. It's easier to put the right sides together and stitch your seam.






As with joining any crocheted fabric, you have a choice of stitching the two pieces with a tapestry needle threaded with the same yarn or working a slip stitch through both edges of the fabric.
 In second ch from the hook, sl st in each st across. Fasten off.
