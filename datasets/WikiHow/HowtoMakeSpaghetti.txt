 Spaghetti should be soft in the center but not mushy when finished. Test a strand of pasta to make sure it is finished before turning off the stove. If the center is still hard, allow to cook for an additional minute or two and test again.
 Drain the pasta in the sink using a colander or large strainer, then transfer pasta to a plate. Serve immediately.


If spaghetti is served dry, drizzle with olive oil or butter.
 Place the pan on the stove on high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer.
