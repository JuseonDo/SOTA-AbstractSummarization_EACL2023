 You should see numerous lights turn on in the dash.;
, In some cases, such as a low fuel warning light, you may need to press the 'BC' button on the end of the indicator stalk once to remove them.
 An exclamation mark will appear in the screen in middle of the speedometer, but keep holding down the button until the next picture appears- then let go.
 When you arrive at the service that you wish to reset press and hold the black button until the text 'Reset?' is visible under the picture, then let go. Finally press and hold the button again to confirm the reset.
 This is done similarly by pressing singularly to scroll though the numbers and a long press to confirm your selection. Also I have had instances where statutory inspections will not reset. In Australia neither of these services are required and they can be removed at any BMW dealership, if you can't reset them manually you'll have to visit the dealer.
