 The movie begins. If you have seen the movie before a good way to spoil it for everyone is to reveal the ending before the movie has even begun. Doing that will make most people angry and sometimes that's enough to make them so annoyed that they'll tell you to leave. Be careful, though. People could get very angry with you.;
, The main character(s) is/are introduced. Say "Oh man! Not THAT actor. Are we going to see him/her throughout the entire movie?!".
 Don't forget to tell them either when you see them or in the end.
 An (un)exciting scene. In a scene with lots of excitement or emotions it's very easy to annoy people, just begin talking about anything you can think of.
 Those scenes are supposed to be very emotional. In other words - A perfect opportunity to with a calm voice say "Game over".
 In those scenes it's a perfect idea to tell random did-you-know facts.(Try "did you know more than half of people who think their lover will be theirs forever gets dumped?)

, In 75% of all those times the main character survives to a perfect thing to say is "Oh yes. I know this. A few seconds of excitement and then proves him-/herself to be alive".
,, When they get annoyed at you, pretend to be focused on the movie.
 Ask what the words the characters have used mean.
