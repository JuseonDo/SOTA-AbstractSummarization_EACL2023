Although many herding dogs will attempt to protect the herd from predators, their primary job is to keep the herd together and move it.
Livestock protection dogs have been bred not to chase and intimidate a herd, but rather live quietly among it. A livestock protection dog must view the livestock as family, as the dog's relationship with the herd fuels its desire to protect it. It is much like house dog's drive to protect its family and home.
A good livestock guardian dog must have an advanced ability to make the right decisions on its own. That includes using aggression only when necessary, and only to protect the lives of its family.;
, They are a good choice when bears and mountain lions are a potential herd predator.
 Although some people feel that a wide range of dog breeds can be raised to protect livestock, the most commonly used breeds include:


Akbash
Maremma
Great Pyrenees
Anatolian Shepherds

,


Local veterinarian offices, animal shelters, dog rescue groups and animal associations may be able to provide you with contact information for locating your chosen breed of livestock guard dog.
Get your livestock guardian dog as a puppy and let it grow up with the herd that you want it to protect. If getting your puppy from a breeder, be sure to check into its bloodlines and look for herd-work lineage.
Alternatively, if getting an older dog, make sure you get one that was properly raised and trained for livestock protection.
