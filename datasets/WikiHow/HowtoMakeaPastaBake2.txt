, You are under-cooking the pasta because it will finish cooking in the oven.
 Make sure that the skillet is large enough to hold the spaghetti sauce , which you will be adding later. Stir the onion and ground beef occasionally with a spatula so that they cook evenly.
 This will help the flavors mix and blend together. Stir occasionally so that everything cooks evenly.
 Use a spatula to spread the pasta across the bottom of the dish in a even layer, then lay all of the Provolone slices on top. Spread the sour cream on top of the Provolone cheese. You will add the rest of the pasta in another layer.


Use a 9 by 13 inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking dish.
 Try to spread it as evenly as possible. You are only using half now, because you will be adding the rest of it in another layer.
 Spread the pasta across the sauce mixture first, then add the mozzarella cheese. Try to spread everything as evenly as possible. Finish off with the rest of the sauce mixture.
 This will be your finishing touch, and help create that final, crispy layer.
 If you want to get that nice, crispy layer on top, place your dish under the broiler until the cheese turns golden. This will take about 4 minutes., This also allows the sauce to settle into all of the nooks and crannies of the pasta.
