 Infant clothes, diapers, or anything like that works. Blankets and towels may be too big for cupcakes.

Get some cupcake wrappers (get them themed, dinosaurs, butterflies, etc.) Also, pick out a thin ribbon to tie it together when finished.
Get a tiny sock (only one). This works better when making an even number of cupcakes. You can also get a clear box, like a donut box, to put all of the cupcakes in when finished.This article is going to be referring to a baby onesie .;
, Do this until the onesie is thin.,, Make sure the sock stays visible. Once you're done rolling, it should start to look like a cupcake! Tape the loose end to the cupcake to prevent it from coming off., Get the thin ribbon and tie it around the cupcake to hold it together., Sit them all neatly in the container. Once done, you can tie a nice ribbon around it to make it look beautiful!
