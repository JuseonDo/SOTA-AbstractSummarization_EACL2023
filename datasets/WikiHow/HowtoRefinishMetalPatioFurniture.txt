 Decorating old or unfinished furniture lets you make a creative statement. Take a look at the following decorating tips. Try some out on your furniture:;
, Turn an old combination radio/phonograph in a beautifully veneered cabinet into an elegant foyer console. Try using drums as tables; bunch together a trio of tribal drums and use them as individual coffee tables.

 Tie it in place with rope or grosgrain ribbon.
 Garage sales and junk stores are good sources. Just decide where to add them. Nail them into place.
 Safeguard with a finishing glaze or coat of polyurethane.
 Get out the trusty hot-glue gun to attach interesting gimp (an ornamental braid or cord), fringe, or other trim along the bottom of the seat.
 Paint stores have rows of booklets describing various techniques step-by-step. They also carry kits. Everything you need is right there in store.
 Paint mismatched chairs bold colors (all the same or coordinating colors). Stencil your children’s names on the chair backs, or add a motif. Craft shops have small glue-on toys, animals, numbers, and initials.
 For color combination ideas, pick the colors already in your scheme. Some paint companies put out booklets of historic color combinations; check these out for instant inspiration.
 All you need is tape (you can buy special masking tape at the paint store), a brilliant color or two, and a very steady hand wielding a paintbrush. Measure off the stripes using a ruler and a pencil to make light marks.
 Dhurries, needlepoint, or chain-stitch rugs transform tables into desks and display areas for framed family photos.
 Punch a hole in the back to slip through the wires for any appliances. Display glasses and ice buckets.
 Use flatter pillows for seats and backs and fluffier ones for decoration and added comfort.
