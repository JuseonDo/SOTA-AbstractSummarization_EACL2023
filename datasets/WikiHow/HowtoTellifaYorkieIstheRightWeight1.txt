 Make sure the Yorkie is relaxed and will stand for the scale and not misbehave.;

You can do this at the vet's office. This idea is good, because there your vet will tell you if the dog is overweight or underweight and what to do about that. Also, the vet will usually have the proper tools for the job.
 You can do this on a table or counter-top since the dog is so small and that would probably be easier for you.
 To do this you will need to know the average weight for the dog.


Average size- Height= 8–9 inches (20.3–22.9 cm)   Weight=4-7 pounds
Overweight Yorkies can be around 10 pounds or more.
If the dog is overweight monitor its diet or exercise it more.
 And always compare to average weights, a dog the size of a Yorkie could lose weight fast.
