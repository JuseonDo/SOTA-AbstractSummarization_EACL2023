@summary
if using a filter, measure the inside circumference of the filter.

@summary
once you have the measurements, make a template.
@article
 This example traces the outside of the filter which is actually too large.


If you have a compass, once you know the size that it needs to be, that will simplify the matter greatly.;
, You will probably want one for each different size lens that you have.


Keep in mind that the template for fitting inside of a filter and going onto a 'hood' for your lens will be two different sizes.
