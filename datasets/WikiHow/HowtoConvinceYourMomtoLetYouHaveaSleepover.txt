, Find out what their issues are. See if you can work around them.
 Even if the sleep over is for your birthday, do it on a Saturday to Sunday because it's the best time. This way you are hopefully not disturbing your parents when they have to go to work.
 Don't plan on inviting loads of people. A couple of friends is a good number.
 If you are old enough, drink responsibly.
 If you want to play games, do it earlier on in the night, not at 2 o'clock in the morning.
 You might appreciate it one day.
 If they know what you want to do, they won't be so apprehensive about what you're planning to get up to.
 If they don't like your friend and you ask beforehand, in case your mum and dad says "yes", make sure to tell your friend to behave around the house and to not make too much noise.
