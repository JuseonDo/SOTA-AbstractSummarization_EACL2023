@summary
check out a conflict style indicator and or a personality style indicator.

 Both in general and specifically.


Between various sub-groups?
Between workers and management?
Between management and upper leadership?

, These types of issues are both signs and continual causes of poor morale.
 The conflict style indicator will tell you a lot about how work communication is going and the personality indicator will tell you if people are having misunderstandings about how they and their co-workers function.
