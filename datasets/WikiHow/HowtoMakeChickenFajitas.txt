,, Use the grater against one of the lime to get grated rind. Place the shavings into a bowl and then squeeze the juice from both limes. Add the cayenne, oregano, caster sugar, cinnamon, and salt/pepper into the bowl. Mix everything together.
 Place the bowl on the side for about 30 minutes. Just a tip - the longer you leave it in the marinade, the more juices will soak into the chicken pieces.
 Add the chicken and marinade to the pan. Cook everything until the chicken is tender or for about 5 minutes.
 Stir and cook for 3 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Add more seasoning if needed.
 Place the chicken mixture into a warmed flour tortilla with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. Roll the wrap and garnish with parsley.
