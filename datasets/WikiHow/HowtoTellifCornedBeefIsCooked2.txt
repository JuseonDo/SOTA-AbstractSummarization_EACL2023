 Cover it with water.



Place the lid on the pot right when you turn it down.



This is often referred to as the traditional method of cooking corned beef.
 After a few hours of cooking, tip 1 side of the lid up to check that the water is still covering the brisket.


Add 1 cup (237ml) of boiled water to the top of the pot, if the water is getting low.
Check the meat 1 to 2 times to ensure you keep water levels high.
This will replace water that is lost through steam.
 Every time you remove the lid, you will extend the cooking time slightly.
, Test the meat with a fork. If it is fork-tender it is most likely done., Insert a meat thermometer into the center of the brisket.


If the thermometer reads 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius), it is cooked.
