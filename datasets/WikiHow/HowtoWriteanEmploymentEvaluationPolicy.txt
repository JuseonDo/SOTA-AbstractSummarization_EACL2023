You will review the employee's capabilities and success according to what the position's job description says. Promotions will depend on the individual assessments.
Make a note to discuss how the employee acts in a professional capacity within the realms of his or her job. Does the staff member interact with the public appropriately? This is an important point in most businesses.
There are, sometimes, poor employee assessments to be addressed. The policy must reflect what will happen in these cases. It ties into the levels discussed in the next step and is often a contributor toward termination.;

This means the supervisor will decide the differing levels of evaluation. For example, a person can get a score of 1-to-5 on each question. The total of the assessment questions should be averaged for a final account.
Talk about what the employees should expect with each level of their evaluation. Examples of levels would be that each person with a 5 point average would get a 5 percent raise and so on down to a 1 with no raise.
 These feelings are not relevant to how the staff member performs specific job requirements.
 Multiple people within a department will each have different evaluation questions due to varying duties. Each one will be based on the initial employment evaluation policy.
 Needless to say, it will be tweaked as needed for each individual job due to differing responsibilities.


Ask in the evaluation form if the employee carries out all of his or her specific job requirements as expected. This may be done through more than one question.
Leave a place for supervisor comments of the assessment.
Be sure to capture the employee's assessment of his or her own job. This is extremely important in that the employee will be signing the evaluation.
