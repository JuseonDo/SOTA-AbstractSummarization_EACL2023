 He'll ask for Drowzee in Gold and Silver, and Abra in Crystal. Both can be found on Route 34, the route below Goldenrod City. Abra can also be bought from the Game Corner for 200 coins if you don't want to deal with it fleeing from a wild battle.;
, Whitney's Miltank is level 20, so you'll want to level it up high enough to stand a chance against the Miltank.
 Given that those attacks are Fighting-type attacks, they'll be super effective. It'll also be resistant to Miltank's Rollout (a Rock-type attack), and if it's female, immune to its Attract attack.
