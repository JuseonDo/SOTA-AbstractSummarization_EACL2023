 Choose a plastic bag that is large enough to hold the seasoning and both chicken breasts.;
, Add your favorite penne pasta to the boiling water and cook until noodles are al dente. Drain the pasta in a large colander and rinse with cool water to stop the cooking process.
 Add 2 tbsp. of butter, and allow it to melt slowly. Don’t leave the skillet unattended as the butter may burn or scorch if cooked too long.
 You won’t need these until serving, but if you want fresh tomatoes, you’ll need to dice them at some point., Now, you’re ready to add the chicken breasts to the large plastic bag containing the Cajun seasonings. Seal the bag and shake vigorously in order to coat both pieces of chicken thoroughly.
 Use tongs to handle the chicken.
 After it cooks for about two minutes on one side, turn the chicken, and continue to rotate until it’s halfway done.
 Turn the heat to medium and add 2 tbsp. butter, heavy cream, salt, pepper, lemon pepper, and garlic powder. Stir occasionally.
 Don’t let too much of the mixture evaporate.
 After you’ve taken the skillet with reduced sauce off of the heat, add in your pasta. Stir well to spread the cream sauce evenly throughout the pasta.
 Place on a cutting board, and cut the chicken into strips.
 Top with your chicken breast strips.
 Sprinkle on Parmesan cheese as well, if you like.
 Rub olive oil and garlic over the top of cut crusty bread, and bake at 400 degrees F (204 degrees C)—or broil—for two to three minutes in the oven.
