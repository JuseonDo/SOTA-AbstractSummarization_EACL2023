 This helps to prevent any germs you may have picked up on your hands (from touching contaminated surfaces) from infecting you.


Wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before eating, and after touching surfaces that may have been shared with the sick person (and that may therefore be contaminated with germs).
If it is challenging for you to wash your hands with soap and water, another option is to carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you. For instance, if you work in a healthcare facility, this may be your most convenient option as you will be around sick people all day every day.;
, If the infected person is in a care facility and you work there, the cleaning will be taken care of by janitors and other staff.


Common disinfectants include a bleach-water solution (add 1/2 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water), detergents, Lysol, or alcohol-based cleaning solutions., It is for this reason that it is important to ask the sick person to cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue, so that the droplets do not spread as far in the air. Also, using a tissue is better than the person using their hand; if they use that hand the germs can then be passed onto any surfaces touched thereafter.
