 You can link your bank account to your PayPal account to easily send and receive money on the Internet.


You must have a PayPal account and the Android or iOS app installed to link your bank account with this method.
No matter which bank you use, you’ll have to wait 2-3 business days before your account is verified. This is different than the web version, which has an automatic linking option for some major banks.;
, Enter your email address and password when prompted and then tap “Log In.” Once you’re logged in, you’ll see your PayPal profile.
 This icon is at the top right corner of the screen. Once tapped, you’ll see a menu containing several options.
 Now you’ll see the “Banks and Cards” screen, where you can add and remove cards and bank accounts.
, Tap the word “Type” and choose either “Checking” or “Savings” from the menu.
 Type your routing number and bank account number into the provided blanks. Find this information in your bank statement, or look at a check.


The routing number is the first set of 9 numbers printed at the bottom of each check.
Your account number is the second set of numbers on your check and is 3-17 numbers long.
 Once these deposits appear in your account, you’ll be ready to confirm your bank account with PayPal., When you see the two small deposits from PayPal, you’ll be ready to confirm your account online.


These deposits are temporary and will be removed by PayPal shortly after verification.
 Once you’ve received the two small deposits, launch the PayPal app and sign in to your account.
 The Settings menu will expand.
 You will see the new unconfirmed bank account listed here.
 Have the two small deposit amounts prepared, as you will be entering them in just a moment.
 Make sure you enter them exactly as they appeared in your account., This bank account is now linked to PayPal. Now you can use it to send and receive money online.
