 Many of these courses are offered as part of college studies, but you can also enroll in certificate programs or see what your local community college offers.;
, Whether you build the backdrop, design an entire set, or work as a prop master, the experience will help you build invaluable skills for your career.
 Take photographs of sets you designed, and if you have clippings with favorable reviews of any production you worked on, add them. If you have any film work, create a reel with clips.
 Of course, this is easier said than done, but learning from somebody who is highly experienced and skilled will enhance the quality of your work. Send out cover letters and resumes, along with your portfolio, to art directors in your area and ask if he or she needs an intern or an apprentice. Don't expect to be paid for any of this work, so you'll need another source of income to support yourself.
 Try to always be working on a project, even if it's an amateur production, an internship, or a low-budget film.
 Approach production companies, directors, and studio execs by email or mail with your cover letter, resume and portfolio. Reply to classifieds on Mandy.com and other film production job boards.

 You never know when your resume might land on the right desk and get you a call back.
