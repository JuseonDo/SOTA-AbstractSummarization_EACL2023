hotspot shield and other popular vpn services change your ip address very often.

@summary
every program that you run over the internet runs behind the new ip address assigned to you by your free vpn provider.

@summary
using a vpn ensures that your ip address changes automatically.

 That protects your anonymous identity online. Your actual IP address is never accessible nor visible to anyone over the internet when youâ€™re using a VPN.
 This ensures that you sign up with websites as a person from a different location than where you actually are. Snoopers are then not able to trace your location or your identity.
 You do not need to adjust your IP address manually; the VPN software does that automatically for you.
