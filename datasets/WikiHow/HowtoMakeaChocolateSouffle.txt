 Try to use the center rack. Remove any racks above the center one to give the souffle room to rise.;
, Add some sugar and tilt to coat all inside surfaces.
 Stir occasionally. It should be quite hot.
 (Remember, the bottom of pot or bowl should not be touching the water.) Whisk until lukewarm. Remove from heat and use an electric mixer to whip the eggs to stiff peaks. Use a rubber spatula to Fold NOT Beat the hot chocolate into the whipped eggs. How well you fold will affect the chocolate distribution in the souffle.
 Fill to about one inch below the rim of the mold. (Yes, if you overfill the mold you will get a really high souffle.) Place in the center of the oven. (Did you remove the racks above the souffle?) Bake until the souffle has risen 1.5 times in height and starts to brown on top â€” approximately 20 minutes. Remove from oven.

Do Not Open The Oven while it is baking. If you do - even for a couple of seconds - it will collapse.
