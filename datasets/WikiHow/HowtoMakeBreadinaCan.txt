, Only use a can that is free or damage and/or rust. Clean with hot soapy water and rinse well. Dry with a clean cloth and make sure lid is also clean and dry.


Spray the inside of the can with non-stick butter spray or coat with oil or margarine.
 Mix well to fully integrate and combine ingredients.
 Make a soft ball until all the flour is completely integrated.
 Sprinkle flour and knead slowly so you can determine when you’ve achieved the desired consistency.
 If you fill the can all the way with dough it will spill over as it rises.
 The lid will provide an ideal environment for yeast to rise.


Lid will pop off once bread has fully risen.
 Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown.
