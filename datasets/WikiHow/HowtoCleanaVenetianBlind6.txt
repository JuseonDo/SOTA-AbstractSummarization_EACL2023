 Follow the instruction manual for the method of removal. Be sure to keep an eye on any loose pieces and not lose them.
 Fold it back where it is too long. Ensure that the blind is fully covered by warm water. Add a simple cleaning solution, such as dish detergent or bleach.
 Scrub gently with a soft cleaning brush. It the blind suffers from a deep build-up of grime, it may need to soak overnight.
 Empty the cleaning water. Either use a bucket to slosh fresh water over the blind or run the shower over the blind until all soap residue is removed.
 outdoors if the weather is fine. Allow to dry. If needed, a hairdryer set on cool can speed up the drying process.
