, Charging is often better when it is well-venilated.
 Apple Watches usually charge best overnight.
 In Nightstand mode, the buttons on Apple Watch are used the snooze and stop alarms. The screen shows time and a battery ring, along with the date and next alarm. Indicators at the top tell you if you aren't connected to your iPhone or Wi-Fi and if you have notifications. The charging indicator is never shown.
