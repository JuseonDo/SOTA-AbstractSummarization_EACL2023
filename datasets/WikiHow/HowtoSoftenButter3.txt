 Measure out the amount of butter you need for your recipe, using the markings on the packaging or a kitchen scales. Place the rest of the butter back in the refrigerator.
 There's no need to close the bag, just leave it open.
 Give the butter several firm whacks and it should soften up nicely. This method is also a great stress-reliever!
