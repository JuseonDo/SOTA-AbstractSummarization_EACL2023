,, In here, you will be sharing your files with your personal Gmail account. Suggested files include: resume, cover letter, and any works that you want your prospective employer to see (research papers, collaborative work, etc.) Simply select the files you wish to share, click the blue "Share" button, and type your personal Gmail address in the box. Click "Share".
 Access your Google Drive "Shared with Me" directory to view the files you shared.
 If you only moved the shared documents into your Google Drive and those documents were later deleted from the original source, your shared document would also then be deleted.
 This will be the designated folder where you can place all your publicly-viewable documents.


To ensure you can view your portfolio documents from any account, select the folder and click More>Share. Change "Private - Only you can access" to "Public on the web" by clicking the blue "Change..." button. Click "Save" then click "Done". This causes your folder to be viewable by anyone online; be sure to only include professional-looking documents, etc.
 But how do you get people to view all of that? By connecting your folder's link to already viewable media (videos, QR codes, business cards, etc).
 Hit Ctrl + C on your keyboard to copy that link.
 Now paste your folder link onto your paper resume, business card, or as a clickable icon in your Gmail signature. You can also create a QR that links to the folder, your portfolio. The possibilities are endless!
