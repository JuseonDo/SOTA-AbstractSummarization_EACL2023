, Complete toilet removal is not mandatory to paint a bathroom, but it is suggested to make painting the wall behind the toilet easier. In some cases, toilet tanks might be too close to the wall for paint application.
 Tape at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) in width is recommended. Smooth down tape with a putty knife to ensure full adherence and to avoid any paint getting under the tape.
 Make sure the edges of the drop cloths are up against the baseboard to avoid any paint dripping onto exposed areas of the floor.
 Use a brush around the edges where the ceiling meets the walls. Complete the job by using a roller on the end of an extension pole. Allow for required drying time, then apply a second coat of paint to the ceiling.
 If your bathroom is currently dark and you are looking to make it brighter with a light, softer color, you will need to prime the walls. Follow manufacturer instructions for application details and dry time.
 Start in one corner and work in one direction around the entire room.
 As with cutting in, start in one corner and work in one direction around the room. Paint using a vertical motion. Avoid applying too much pressure to the roller.
