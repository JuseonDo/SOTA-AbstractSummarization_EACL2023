 The beer scent is much less potent when flat.
 Once saturated, squeeze the excess beer from your locks.


Cut up a lemon and squeeze its juice all over your beer-drenched locks for an additional lightening effect., Beer will also make your hair shinier.
 After 60 minutes have passed, rinse the beer completely from your locks. Then wash and style your hair as you normally would. Your hair will look shiny and naturally sun-kissed. Repeat as often as you like.Keep in mind that if you added lemon juice, your strands are going to feel a bit dry. Apply your usual conditioner liberally to your hair and leave on for 2-5 minutes before rinsing.
If you plan on doing the beer and lemon rinse frequently, consider deep conditioning or using a leave-in conditioner to prevent your hair from getting dry and brittle.
