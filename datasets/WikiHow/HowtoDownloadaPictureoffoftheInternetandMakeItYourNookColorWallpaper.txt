  This step is pretty self- explanatory.;
,, Tap the center button at the bottom of the page (if you have not turned on WiFi, now is the time to do that), and select the button that says "Web".
  Tap the URL bar and enter the URL of the search engine you wish to go to (I used Google).  Once the page loads, find the button that says "Images" and click on it.
 examples: waterfalls; puppies; etc.
  Tap that picture and hold it for a few seconds. A small box will come up with two options, Save or View. I find that the picture will look better if you click view, then repeat the tap and hold step, then click save. 

,  Just exit out of this, if you wish to.  The image will continue downloading.
 The image will transfer over to your gallery when your Nook Color is off.
 Click on the center button at the bottom of the home page. Select "Extras".  The Extras screen will come up.
  At the bottom, options will come up.  Select "Wallpaper".  If the picture you selected does not match the Nook Color screen size, you will be asked to crop it.
  The picture will make itself your home screen background.  Click on the "N button at the bottom of your Nook Color. The picture you selected should be your new wallpaper.
