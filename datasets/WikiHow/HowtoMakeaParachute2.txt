 A napkin on the thicker side will be best so it won't tear. But if it's too thick, the parachute won't be as aerodynamic.
 Use yarn of medium thickness for the best results.
 Just pinch the ends of the napkin and tie the yarn around them. This method of attachment works better than poking holes in the napkin, because this will make the napkin more likely to tear.
 Tie them together at their ends, creating one thick knot.
 Tie this piece to the knot that holds the other four threads together. This piece will attach to the toy that will use the parachute.
 Find any toy suitable for parachute use and tie the hanging string around it. Once you've firmly attached the string to the toy, tie the free end to the knot that holds the threads together to attach the toy to the parachute. It should tie around the middle of the toy for balance.
 To see your parachute in action, just place your hand inside its center, throw the parachute in the air, and let it go. Watch the parachute and your toy float down safely.
