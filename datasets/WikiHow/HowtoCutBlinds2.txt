 Ensure that the pull cord is fully engaged so there is no slack.
 Make sure they are tight, but also even. You want them to line up perfectly for a perfect cut.


The band or clamp should be on the inside of wherever you're making your cut.
 This is especially helpful if you are working with wood or faux wood blinds.
 This will be right in line with your newly cut headrail. Use a straight edge to ensure they are lined up nicely and draw a line to cut with.
 Once you've created your line, slide the slats away from the headrail, if possible.
 For plastic blinds, you might even be able to use a powerful set of sheers.
 If not, trim individual elements as needed to ensure a consistent width. Use some sandpaper to clean off the edges of the blinds.
