A single pole switch means that the light is controlled only by 1 switch. A 3-way switch means 1 or more light switches control 1 light.;

Use a screwdriver to take out the 2 screws that hold the plate into place.

If your switch is 3-way, there will be 3 wires that are fastened to 3 screws. One of the 3 wires connects to a screw that is unlike the others in color or in label. Place a piece of tape or tag on that wire for later use when installing the dimmer.
If your switch is single pole, 2 wires will be fastened to 2 screws. The colors should be the same.



For single pole switches, take the green ground wire from the wall terminal and connect it to the ground wire from your new dimmer. Curl the wires around each other clockwise and place a wire connector nut over the connection. Connect the 2 black dimmer wires to wires from the wall terminal.
For 3-way switches, perform the same initial process as you would for single pole switches by connecting the green ground wire of the wall box to the ground wire of the dimmer. Take a black dimmer wire and connect it to the wall wire you taped or tagged. Connect the other 2 black dimmer wires to the remaining wall terminal wires. Make sure to place wire connector nuts over each connection.
,,,, The dimmer should now operate.
