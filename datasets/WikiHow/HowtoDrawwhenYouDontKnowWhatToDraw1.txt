,,, Do not draw anything specific. Just move pencil around on paper. Try not to take the pencil off the paper at all, so you get one big, curvy line.
 You will probably like what you see. It looks very artistic and yet you can't tell what it is. Although, you are not done yet.
 Shapes do not have to look real as long as you can tell what it is because you are making an abstract drawing. Once you find some objects, take a pencil and make them stand out by outlining them so you can see them clearly. Find several shapes to make an image.
 Once you have a good background, color in the shapes. Colors can be realistic, although your image will look a lot more abstract and interesting if you make colors different then they are supposed to be. You are done!
