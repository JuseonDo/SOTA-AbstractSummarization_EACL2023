, For this tutorial, I'll be making a red apple.
 Now you have a smaller working space!

, The white space should be bigger. Click on the magnifying glass again, and then click 8x. The white space now covers the whole paint screen.
 Start with a light color, as we are going to shade.
 Mine is an apple, so I'll start with the apple. It's pink! Then, color the inside the same color.
, It's time for shading! Pick two or three more darker colors then the base color (pink).
 Starting from the lightest to the darkest, in the apple, draw thick lines that follow the shape of the apple. The result will be better then plain, non-shaded one! Still using the pencil. This is what I got:

, I added a small highlight to make it look nicer. Here is what I got at the end, including the colors I used.
 To do this, Click on the magnifying glass, then click on the picture. Admire your pixel!





, Then, move your pixel to the top left corner of the white space, but leave little space, so your pixel won't be cut.
 Find the below right corner dot, and move your cursor to it until a double arrow shows up, then drag it to your pixel, but remember, not to close. Then, let go of your mouse. All is left would be just your pixel and a little white space.
 If you cannot save it in PNG, the second best one is BMP. Not on anything else!
