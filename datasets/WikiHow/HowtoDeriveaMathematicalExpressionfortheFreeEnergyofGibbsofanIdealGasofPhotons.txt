learn the theory.

@summary
use a derivation of the equation of an ideal gas of photons based on the recent theory of photons that are related through an equation of forces and velocities of light photons.

@summary
by using the ideal gas law pv=nrt, one can isolate v in terms of the other components so that one has the following expression:

@summary
v=nrt/p

@summary
,

@summary
by substituting this value of v into the equation of dg one gets:

@summary
dg=nrt*dp/p

@summary
,

@summary
by integrating both sides of the equation one gets the following formula for g:

@summary
g = nrt*ln(p2/p1)

@summary
,

@summary
we know, however, from previous work the following equation: f1*l=nrt*ln(v2/v1), that we can change the pressure function in the mathematical expression for g to the volume using the ideal gas equation:

@summary
pv=nrt

@summary
,

@summary
by doing so the mathematical expression for g looks now like this:

@summary
g = nrt*ln(v1/v2)

@summary
,

@summary
we want now to write the expression of g in terms of parameters of the photon equation of forces.

@summary
,

@summary
by doing so one gets the following mathematical expression:

@summary
g = -f1*l

 The free energy of Gibbs is a thermodynamic function that is formulated under the on control of the temperature and pressure. his basic thermodynamic function has importance especially in predicting spontaneous direction of chemical reactions. Its absolute value is indicative about the direction of the chemical reaction.


For example, a positive value of this function usually signifies a non-spontaneous direction of the chemical reaction.
Also, a negative value of this thermodynamic function is usually indicative of a spontaneous process of the thermodynamic reaction. A zero value of the free energy of Gibbs usually signifies an equilibrium state of the chemical reaction. Therefore, this thermodynamic function is predominantly used to predict the direction of spontaneity of thermodynamic processes.;
, The free energy of Gibbs has the following general mathematical structure: G=H-TS. It can be shown that at constant temperature the free energy of Gibbs has the following differential form:


dG=VdP






This expression is correct for an ideal gas at constant temperature.
,,,,,,, This simple mathematical expression relates the free energy of Gibbs of an ideal gas of photons to the force F1 in terms of the work that is done by this force along the distance L.


If the force F1 sign is positive then this means that the G is negative and the process that involves the photons is spontaneous.
If the sign of the force F1 is negative then this means that the value of G is positive and the process that involves the photons is then non-spontaneous.
