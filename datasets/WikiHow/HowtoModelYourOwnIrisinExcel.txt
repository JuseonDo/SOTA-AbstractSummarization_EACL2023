@summary
using the file menu or the icon, open a new workbook;

@summary
save the workbook as "model your own iris in excel" into a logical folder, such as "wikihow articles" or "ms xl imagery";

@summary
create via the + button at the bottom or access the second worksheet tab and double-click edit-name it "saves" -- this will be used to paste values and charts to which you wish to keep and remember, while still having the top worksheet tab for doing the main work on -- if you were to copy and paste, the formula results would change with varying inputs on the top worksheet from the defined named variables, which are global;

@summary
double-click on the first leftmost worksheet tab and edit-name it "circle data and chart" (w/o quotes).

@summary
set preferences:

@summary
create the basic chart

@summary
edit go to cell range c3:d363 and do menu item insert chart or select charts from the ribbon, all, scatter, smoothed line scatter -- a chart should appear atop your worksheet -- resize it to fit into i16:p47 and pull the plot area open until it's about 1/2" from each side of the external border.

@summary
decide the style you want: thin fiber style or blocks style (extra wide line thicknesses).

@summary
decide whether you will have just the front group of fibers, or both front and back groups and, if so, how detailed the back group needs to be.decide if you need an "exploding flower" as part of your design -- if so, research the designs of the eggies spiritual adventures series of articles written by xhohx and you will find a rose pattern with a hole in the center to get you started -- try create a dakini and boddhisattva aspect of the mother planet or see the related wikihow below.

@summary
decide how many fibers you want per quadrant -- this example uses 30 per quadrant of 90 degrees, or 120 in all 4 quadrants of 360 degrees.

@summary
do data series 2 and chart it:

@summary
using the command key between selections and the shift key within selections, select cell ranges g1:h1, g2:h3 and g4:h14 simultaneously and do format cells border red bold outline per section.

@summary
do data series 3:

@summary
copy g1:h15 and paste it to i1;

@summary
change i1's cell contents to =g1+1; (so that it automatically increments to 3)

@summary
increase by 3 each of the references in cells i2:j3 -- this is most quickly accomplished by selecting cell range i2:j3 and doing edit replace 5 with 8, all, ok.

@summary
change j4 to the briefer (d*pc)*sin(º);

@summary
change i15 to =g15+3; go back and change g15 to 5.

@summary
copy i1:j15 and paste it to k1, then copy i1:l15 and paste those two series to m1, bringing your total to 4.

Tap within the circle on the chart to select the plot area and do menu item Chart Add Data. Select cell range G5:H13 in response to the Query Box that arises. Do not be alarmed if the results are wrong. There may be two lines, one of which is extra. Find, by tapping on each series plot, between the two the one which ends with ...$H$5:$H$13,2) because that's the one you want and the other one is to be deleted. Correct in the formula bar the beginning of the series to $G$5:$G$13 from the C's or whatever it was in error. The line should plot now at about the 3 PM position in approximately a straight line with a bend at the end. Do Format Series and select the Line width to be 1 or .75 (at most 2), the Glow to be 2 and 50% and choose the color gradients of blues or browns or whites at the tips -- whatever your model picture shows in that position, OK;

, This will cue you as to the row number to use in the top section, e.g. in I2:J3 -- (the 3 was used to keep track of numbers of lines plus glow lines already added previously)(in truth, however, often a line thickness of .75 or 1.75 was used simply because 3.75 was the default, and 1 + 2 glow lines had not been figured out yet until it was seen that the center pupil was not coming out as a near-perfect circle at all, due to such variations as line thickness and glow variances -- much re-tracing of steps was done; an error which you hopefully needn't repeat);

, Keep doubling in this way until you reach 128 and stop and trim off until the total number of data series, including 2, is 240 columns (120 series of x's and y's).
Do Edit Replace routine per row 15, without any errors, for rows 2 and 3 -- for example, if in Row 15 column G, there is a 5, then replace the common row number in cell range G2:H3 with 5, Replace All, OK; do that for every single series, all the way across!
Construct the chart carefully by selecting the cell range to chart of G5:H13, or I5:J13 for the next series, etc, all the way across, and patiently as per the above step(s); it was found that 30 data points took about 2 hours to do, so the whole chart took 8 hours over 2 days to complete, prior to error cleanup; here is an example of a gradient as you must set the line width and gradient by clicking on the series plot each time you chart a series, all the way across! Remember line width should be .75 to 2 and the gradient and glow size and transparency percentage are set individually per iris fiber in accordance with your individual pupil photo you're copying, but generally should remain constant or the pupil will not come out a nearly perfect circle. The Modifier formula also bears on the situation, so keep that difference pretty tiny, like 1.007 vs. .993, for a total difference of .014, or less. Generally speaking, this author thinks a change of .005 is visible, but is not sure exactly. Visual acuity varies between individuals. On the other hand, Excel has set the minimum line weight at .25, which is definitely thicker than their glow or transparent objects. The situation pictured below, of an imperfect circle, was corrected by keeping glow size to 2 and transparency to 50%, constantly. Otherwise, it is a Gradient Example.





Here is an example of a data chit reconciliation for columns A:D -- just making sure everything was on track;


 A281 to D281 example



, Make it semi-transparent, and change the color to White (and it's best to start with a white object in this author's opinion); place it on the main chart;
