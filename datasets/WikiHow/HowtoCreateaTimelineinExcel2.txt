 In order to automatically generate a timeline, your data must be organized into a pivot table. You also need the pivot table analyze menu, which was introduced in Excel 2013., This will open the “PIVOT TABLE TOOLS” in the top ribbon.
 This will open a ribbon with options to manipulate the data in the table.
 A dialog box will pop up showing fields that correspond to a date format. Note that dates entered as text will not be recognized.
, Depending on the available information you can select how the data will be filtered. (Either by months, years or quarters).
 When you click on a month in the Timeline Control Box, the pivot table will show data that pertains to that particular month alone.
 You may widen your selection by clicking and dragging the sides of the slider.
