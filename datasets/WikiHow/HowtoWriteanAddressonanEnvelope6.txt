 Note that it is common to write a person’s last name in all caps in France — for example, "Mme. Marie-Louise BONAPARTE." Include any necessary titles. You can probably skip titles for close friends and family members, but you might consider including them for government officials, military personnel, doctors, professors or elderly people.
 This is especially relevant in rural areas where houses or estates are known by name. You could write, for example, Chateau de Versailles.
 The street name should be in all caps. For example, you might write "1 ROUTE de ST-CYR."

, For example, 78000 Versailles.
 If you're mailing between countries, include "France" on the last line.
