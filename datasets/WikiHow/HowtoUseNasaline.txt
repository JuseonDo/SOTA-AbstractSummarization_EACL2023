  Gently fill the Nasaline applicator with the saline solution.;
,,  This process should take from 3 to 7 seconds for each nostril.  By reflex, your palate will close so that the solution will pour out of the other nostril.
  It s recommended to flush 2 full syringes twice in each nostril once or twice a day, or as instructed by your physician.
  If some of the saline solution remains in your nasal passages, it will trickle out within a few hours.  Or you can lean forward and tilt your head from side to side immediately after rinsing to release it.
  When finished nasal rinsing, clean your Nasaline by completely pulling out the plunger from the syringe, removing the silicone tip and flushing all 3 parts with water.  You can also clean your Nasaline with a mild dishwashing liquid and rinse well.  Allow your Nasaline to air dry.
