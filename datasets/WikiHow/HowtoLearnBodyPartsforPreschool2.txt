 Ask the student to point and repeat the name.
 The movement creates a link between the child's mind and body because the name is processed from thought into action, which increases the chances of retaining the name in the child's memory.
 This will help the child learn how the name of each body part is spelled.
 In this game, you ask the students to perform different tasks involving parts of their body. For example, you could ask them to touch their nose or lift their leg. Explain the game to the students and make sure you say, "Simon says" when you want them to do something otherwise they will not do it (this is the main rule of the game).
 1 of the most popularly used songs is James Weldon Johnson's "Dem Bones" (also known as "Dry Bones" and "Dem Dry Bones"), which describes how different parts of the body are connected to each other. Here are some more songs you may want to sing with the children.


The Bone Dance" by Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus.
The Bone Bounce" by Lucy Jensen.
The Parts of You and Me" by The Little Blue Globe Band (Toddler World TV)
The Bone Song" by Animaniacs (this song describes the importance of each body part in relation to the rest of the body).
 Dancing is a fun way for children to learn preschool anatomy.
 Then ask the students to name which parts of their body are ticklish - preferable places are the sides, belly, armpits, collar and knees.
