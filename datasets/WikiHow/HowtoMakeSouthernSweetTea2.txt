 There's no use in making less than a gallon.
, Set a timer for 30 minutes.
 Add about a cup of sugar, then a little more, because sweet tea has to be really sweet. Or, you can use 2/3 cup of Splenda blend, but 100 percent Splenda isn't really Southern.
 Then add enough cold water to make a gallon. It's ready to drink but tastes better after cooling in the fridge for about 12 hours, if you can wait that long.
