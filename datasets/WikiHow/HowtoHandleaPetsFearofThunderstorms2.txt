 Firstly, try to distract the cat's attention from the thunder. Play games with it or give it a chew that will last a long time, to keep it's mind focused on something other than the storm.
 If your cat is indoors when a thunderstorm starts, keep it inside. Block the cat flap and shut the windows so it can't escape. Even if it goes crazy trying to scratch it's way through the front door, keep it inside. This prevents it from any dangers when running around, frightened, outside.
 It could have it's own comfortable place elsewhere where it prefers to be during a thunderstorm. Also, if you're outside looking for it, it may come running through the cat-flap looking for you. Just stay indoors and wait for it to return, if it wants to.
 When they get scared of a thunderstorm allow them to sit or lie wherever they prefer to, not outside of course, and do not disturb them until the thunderstorm is over.
 Your vet can prescribe this.
,, If you cuddle it, you're only giving it attention, which it likes. So, next time there is a thunderstorm, it will come to you for comfort - this is only making the problem worse!
