@summary
no matter where you go in team slayer you must always remember communication is key.

@summary
recommended to go for the drop shield, because a bubble shield can take a shot of a spartan laser and maybe heal you; neither jetpack or sprint can help you there.
@article
 This does not mean you need a mic, after all there are those who don't often use in game signals, so if someone doesn't say your name but shoots you, don't fire a grenade etc. They might be telling you there is a Spartan Laser up on the balcony above you or that there is an enemy around the corner. This rule applies for all team games like CTF or Big Team Battle Objective Games.
 You can only take one shield, but at least it won't kill you.
