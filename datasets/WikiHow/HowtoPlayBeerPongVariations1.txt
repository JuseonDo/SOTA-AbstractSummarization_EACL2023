 Each side consists of a team of four people. The way it goes is that one team starts, either through winning an eye stare toss or whatever you decide to begin the game. It is not the other team's turn until everyone has thrown their beer pong ball. When cups are made they are left on the table until the end of the turn. If someone from your team makes it in the same cup as you then it counts for 3 cups. If you make 3 balls in the same cup it is 5 cups pulled. Bouncing counts as 2 cups. There are no re-racks in this beer pong game so be strategic about your tosses.
 When shot is made team drinks beer according to own rules (split between all members, or pairs of two, for example).
