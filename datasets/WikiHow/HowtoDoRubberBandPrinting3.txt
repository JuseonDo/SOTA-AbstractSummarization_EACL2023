 Wooden blocks, pieces of cardboard, or small, cardboard jewelry boxes work great for this. Whatever you choose needs to be smaller than your cut rubber bands. This is because you will be gluing the rubber bands on top of the base, not stretching them., Think ahead about your design, then cut apart as many rubber bands as you need. You can use all the same width, but your design will look more interesting if you use both thick and thin rubber bands., Arrange the rubber bands on your base. Play around with different widths. Try to use both thick and thin rubber bands. You can do simple stripes or diagonals. You can also create more interesting designs, such as chevron, zigzags, diamonds, or weaves. Try to leave behind some negative space on the block.You may need to cut some rubber bands shorter so that they fit your design.
 You can use tacky glue or white school glue. Super glue may also work, but not hot glue. Let the glue dry before moving on., Acrylic paint will work best here, but you can also use tempera. You can use all one color, or experiment with different ones.
 You can use plain white paper or even colored paper. White paint on brown packaging paper will give you a nice, rustic effect.
 You can repeat the pattern over and over, or you can rotate the stamp for an interesting look. You should be able to stamp a few times before the paint becomes too pale. When that happens, simply apply more paint.
