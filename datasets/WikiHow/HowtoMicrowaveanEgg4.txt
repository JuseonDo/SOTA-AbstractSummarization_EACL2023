 Choose one with a wide, flat bottom and tall sides.
 Dip a paper towel in a little bit of vegetable or olive oil and smear the oil around the inside of the mug. You could also spray the mug with non-stick cooking spray. Melting butter into the mug is another option.
 These will form the quiche's "crust." Crush up the crackers and pour them into the bowl.
 In a separate bowl, beat together two eggs and a tablespoon of milk. Add a pinch of salt, a shake of pepper, and a handful of your favorite quiche fillings. Here are a few ideas:


Chopped ham, bacon or sausage (precooked)
Chunks of feta cheese
Shredded gruyere cheese
Chopped spinach
Chopped tomatoes

, It will cover up the crackers and rise up the sides of the bowl.
 Use a plate or a paper towel.
 Microwave it on high for 3 minutes. Check the quiche when it's finished cooking to make sure it's set.
 Scoop it out with the spoon and enjoy.
