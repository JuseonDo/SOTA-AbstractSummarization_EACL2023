 If the Mystery Box is in the bar, open the door and hit the Mystery Box. If the Box is near the fence, save up 950 points and hit it. continue saving up and hitting the Box until you either get the Galil, Hamr, or RPD.;
, Save up 3250 points for the Juggernog door and get Juggernog. This is vital in surviving hordes of zombies.
 This is good for your machine guns so they reload quick.
 This makes sure you don't lose your hard earned perks and guns.
 This is important for later rounds when zombies have higher health and are harder to kill.
 You want the Galil, Hamr, or RPD as your primary weapon and duel wielded five-seven or MTAR. Be careful when using the Ray Gun, as the splash damage can easily down you.
 I advise you use the Hammer and duel wielded five-seven because the Hamr is the best machine gun in zombies and the duel wielded five-seven flattens hordes of zombies very quickly and effectively.
 This helps if you need some extra points quick or if you are out of ammo. They are a 1-hit kill, up until round 14 where the become a 2-hit kill.
 These can kill hordes a little easier than regular grenades and are easier to control where you want them to go.
 This will help you greatly in later rounds when you're stuck in a corner or out of ammo.
 You should have all this by round 15, try not to down before then.              Note: this is strictly for team survival only. Good luck!
