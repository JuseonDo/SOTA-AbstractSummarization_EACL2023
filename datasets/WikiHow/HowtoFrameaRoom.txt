The conventional framing method uses 2-by-4 studs on 16-inch (40.64 cm) centers. It uses more wood than the advanced-framing method and has less space between the studs for insulation.
The advanced-framing method uses less wood by using studs on 24-inch (60.9 cm) centers and open corners. The advanced-framing method may be considered by some to be structurally inferior; however, it meets the structural codes of most areas. High-wind areas and areas with seismic activity may be exceptions.



Once you have determined the framing method, determine the number of studs you will need and add 10 percent. Extra wood will give you what you need for headers, fire blocking, and short studs above and below windows and doors.
Buy treated boards for the base plate of each wall.



For example, if you are cutting studs for an 8-foot (2.44 m) wall using the conventional-framing method, the length of the studs would be 91.5-inches (232.41 cm). This is subtracting 4.5 inches (11.43 cm) for the bottom plate and 2 top plates.
For the advanced-framing method, subtract 3 inches (7.62 cm) from 8 feet (2.44 m).

Channels are used where 1 wall will meet another in the middle of a wall.
Corners are used at the end of a wall.



Place the bottom board where you will raise the wall.
,,


Measure the space between each stud to be sure of the distance before you cut the block for that space.



Stagger the fire blocks, and place the blocks near the middle of the wall.



If the 2 measurements do not match, pull or push the top or the bottom of the wall until they do. This will square the wall.
, Raise them to meet the first wall.
