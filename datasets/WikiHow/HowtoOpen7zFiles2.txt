 Because 7z files are compressed archives, you can’t view their contents until the files are extracted with an unzipping program. 7-Zip can extract the contents of 7z archives at no cost to Windows users.


Another popular option is WinZip, which has a free trial version. If you’re unable to use this freeware option, give WinZip a try.



If you’re not sure whether you’re using a 64- or 32-bit Windows, press ⊞ Win+S to launch search, then type “system”. Click “System” in the search results, and look next to “System Type”.,, Follow the prompts to complete the 7-Zip installation.


When the installation is complete, click “Finish.”

,,, The folder you select is where the files inside of the 7z archive will be extracted.


The default selection is a new folder in the current directory, named after the 7z file.
For example, if the file is called Blue.7z and located on the desktop, the default new folder will be created on the desktop with the name “Blue”.
 You’ll see a progress bar for the duration of the unzipping process. When the files are unzipped, the progress bar will disappear. At that point, you can double-click the folder to access the files.
