, This icon appears the bottom of the screen.
 This icon is at the top right of the Contacts screen, signified by a person with a plus (+) sign.
 As you type, Skype will search through your current iPhone contacts. It will also display a link that says “Tap to find new contacts.”

, If you can’t find the right person by name, search by email, if not by email, phone, and so on.
 Tap the user’s icon or name to launch his or her contact request screen.
 The standard text is: Hi, I’d like to add you on Skype, but it can be edited to include your own personal touch. You can delete the entire message or simply add a few words to the original.
 Once that user accepts your request, you’ll be able to interact with them. Until then, your new contact will have a question mark (?) next to their name.
 This step is optional, but can be useful if you want Skype to automatically search your iPhone contacts for Skype users.
