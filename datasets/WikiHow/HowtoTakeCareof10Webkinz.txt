 The best way to keep your webkinz happy, healthy, and full is to keep them all together. Line all of your webkinz up by the tub and give them all a bath until everyone is clean. Put them all in the kitchen and feed them 1 by 1. Read them a story 1 by 1. Put them to bed 1 by 1. Start from youngest webkinz to oldest.;
, Play with them for a bit. Go on a trip. Visit the shop to get their favorite food.
 You should have a big kitchen and enough sleeping space. You should also have many chairs in your living room.
