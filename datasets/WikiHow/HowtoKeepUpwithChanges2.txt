 You cannot complain about change if you haven't taken part in the process.
 Government is often blamed for changes that negatively impact people, and voting is one way to encourage the government to act in the interests of its citizenry.
 By combining resources and voices, your efforts are amplified.
 Learn about the issues involved in changes, and offer suggestions to mediate problems or improve strategies for dealing with change.Â  People may listen if you offer an alternative, but if none are offered, they may assume there isn't a choice.
