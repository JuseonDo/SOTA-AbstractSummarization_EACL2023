 Like physical coupons, there is a wide variety of deals available. Some common examples include a set amount or percentage off the regular price, buy 1 and get 1 free, or a discount if you buy a set value of merchandise.


Some physical coupons now include a coupon code, also called a promotion code, printed on the coupon. This allows you to get the same deal at the company's online shopping site.
You can sometimes find coupon codes via an Internet search. Type "coupon code", "promotion code", "promo code", "discount code" or "voucher code" in the search string, along with a description of the company you want to buy from and/or the item you want to buy.;
,, Go through the process of selecting your items to buy just as you normally would. As with picking out items off a shelf, this part of the process is identical to shopping without a coupon code.
 Confirm that you are buying what you want, and that it fulfills any requirements to qualify for the promotion code you want to use.
 At each page, scan the page for a coupon code or promotion code option. The exact location of this option will vary from vendor to vendor.
 Click the "OK" or similar button on the checkout page. Some vendor sites will make this part of the regular checkout page, while others will direct you to a separate page to confirm your promotion or coupon code.
 If not, navigate back through the checkout process and try again.
