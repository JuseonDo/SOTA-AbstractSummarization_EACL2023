@summary
start by understanding some basic terms:

@summary
weaver - these are the basket strands that weave through the spokes; they are lighter, thinner and more flexible than the spokes, to enable them to be woven in and out;

@summary
spoke - these are the strands that stand upright and form the side supports of the basket; they are much stiffer than the weavers and are strong.

@summary
be familiar with under-and-over-weaving.

@summary
note that double weaving is the same form but two weavers are used at once.

@summary
note that pairing may be used with an odd or even number of spokes.

@summary
identify the triple twist.

, This is the most commonly used technique. It is also the simplest. The illustration indicates its form.
 This is an effective weave on large surfaces, and in bands or patterns of the same or a contrasting colour on plain rattan baskets.
 Two weavers are started behind two succeeding spokes, and crossed between them, so that what was the under weaver becomes the upper weaver each time.
 Here, three weavers are placed behind three consecutive spokes, starting with the back one, over two and under one spoke, each on its way to the back of the third spoke being laid over the other two weavers. In turning up the sides of large baskets where separate spokes or additional spokes have been inserted, or as a strong top for scrap baskets, this weave is invaluable.
