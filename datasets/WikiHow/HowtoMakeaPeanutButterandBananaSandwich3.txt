 Make sure that you cover the entire surface.
 Try to slice it as thinly as possible, about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you slice it too thick, your quesadilla will be too bulky and fall apart.
 The banana slices should be touching but not overlapping. Leave the other half of the tortilla empty; you will be folding it in half.
 You can also use chocolate sauce instead, and drizzle it across the banana slices.
 Press the peanut buttered side of the tortilla onto the chocolate and banana side. Gently press down on it with a spatula to seal it.
 Use a spatula to flip the quesadilla over and gently pat it down. It is done when it turns golden brown and crispy on both sides., Use a spatula to slip the quesadilla onto a large plate. Cut it in half first, then cut each smaller segment in half again.
