, Make sure all your clothes fit you correctly, suit you and show off your figure.
 Even when you just have a plain tee with jeans, you'll look great with a cute hairband or bangles.
 It's okay if you just smell like your nice soap or shampoo. But, if you don't like it, do you have a choice? Perfume your way out!

, Converse or vans are great for day, and small heels are fab when your dressing up.
 Go with a new hairstyle or something. If you plan to use hair straightener or curler, try not to do it regularly, because it might damage and burn your hair.
,, Just some mascara, foundation (or BB cream works great), lip gloss, blush MAYBE (sometimes it looks unnatural so if you do just try a pink or rosy blush), and some eyeshadow. If you want (and your parents allow) get some white eyeliner and put it on the corner of your eyes.
 You don't need to whiten it, but try avoiding bruises and scratches. Use lotion if your hands or legs ever get dry. If you have dark/thick body hair, you may want to start shaving and if you have pale skin, use fake tan.
