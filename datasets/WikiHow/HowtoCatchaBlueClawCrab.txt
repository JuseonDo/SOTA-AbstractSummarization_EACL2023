 Check local state laws for specific details. Some states needed for them to be turtle proof, other states require an exit hole for undersized crabs. Some say that a small cake pan is more efficient.
 The best bait is Bunker, a fish that can be purchased at any bait and tackle shop along the coastal areas. Chicken parts are a good second.
 You can get cord anywhere and a buoy can be purchased at a bait and tackle shop or convert a fairly large cleaning solution jug.
 Cutting the fish in half can increase the smell in the water.
 You can go in any salt water bay area from the shore or off a dock and drop the crab pot in the water. Crab pots are repeating traps so they can be checked periodically throughout the day or left to sit for 24 hours.
, Often the head of a lagoon or inlet does not have a flow and crabs to not enter the area.
;
,,,, Go slowly and try not to scare the crab. Gently reel in your line wrapping it around your stick until the crab is hanging in the air.
, Crabs can live in coolers with ice because the ice slows down their system. Never cook and eat a dead crab. Eat your crabs the same day that you catch them.
