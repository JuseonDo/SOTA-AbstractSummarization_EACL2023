To get started with your Blogger to Joomla import, at first you should backup your current site data. It helps to exclude the data loss risk.;
,


Install a new Joomla website. Also, you may activate some additional extensions. In the case of a blog running, it’s recommended to upload some of the following extensions: JComments, K2 (with this extension you don’t have to activate JComments), EasyBlog or something like that.
,, For such kind of data transfer, use this Joomla extension http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/tools/webbased-tools/23642
