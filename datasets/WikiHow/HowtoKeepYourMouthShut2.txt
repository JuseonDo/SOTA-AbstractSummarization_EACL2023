, If you are trying to start a good conversation at dinner, ask open-ended questions and then back off. The desire to jump in too quickly can prevent people from thinking about the question and expressing themselves.
 Try repeating the adage “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all” the next time you want to complain about a person or argue. You will instantly become a more positive person., Stop talking and start journaling.
