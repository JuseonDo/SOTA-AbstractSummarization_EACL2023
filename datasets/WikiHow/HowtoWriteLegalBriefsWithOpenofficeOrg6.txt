@summary
create and save styles for each level of your headings.

@summary
for heading 2, you want the formatting to be like an outline.

@summary
for heading 3, the second level of your point headings, i choose:

@summary
before text: .89

@summary
after text: .40

@summary
first line: -.40

@summary
,

@summary
so once you made styles for each level of your headings, make sure you selected that style when writing your actual headings in your brief.

@summary
go ahead and write in the basic headings for your opening brief (where the appellate brief body numbering system begins), such as introduction, statement of facts, conclusion, proof of service.

 A quick way to do this is by clicking on the styles and formatting button, scrolling down to heading 1, right clicking, then choosing modify. This will allow you to save a whole range of paragraph styles for for "heading 1." For me, heading 1 is used for the most basic headings like "statement of facts," "argument," and "conclusion." So the formatting is simply the font I use (Century Schoolbook L), bold, and centered.
 Heading 2 will be your first "point heading." For this, I modify the paragraph style just like above. I go to "indents and spacing." There, I check the single space box and type in the following numbers:


Before text: .49
After text: .40
First line: -.40

,, This is essential, otherwise they will not show up when generating a table of contents.
 You might as well add the headings where the appellate brief index numbering system is too, such as TABLE OF CONTENTS, TABLE OF AUTHORITIES.
