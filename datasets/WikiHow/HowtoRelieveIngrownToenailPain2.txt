 If the ingrown toenail becomes severely infected, it can spread to the bone in the toe. You should be checked by a doctor if:The pain is severe.
The toe is infected and oozing pus.
The toe is red and the redness is spreading. This would suggest that the infection is spreading.
You have diabetes or another condition that reduces the circulation in your feet. This makes it more difficult for your body to heal infections in your feel and increases your risk of complications.
 If the toenail is only a little bit ingrown, the doctor may gently lift it out to help it grow over, instead of into, the surrounding skin. The doctor may insert something underneath to hold the nail above the skin. This may be:A small amount of cotton
Dental floss
A small splint

, If your toe is very red, painful, and oozing pus, the doctor may cut away the part of the nail that is digging into the skin and causing the infection.If the procedure is likely to be painful, the doctor may give you a shot of an anesthetic first.
If the toe is infected, the doctor may also prescribe antibiotics.
 This involves removing part of the nail and nail bed. This procedure would only be done if you have a history of reoccurring ingrown toenails. During this procedure, the doctor would remove part of the nail and the underlying nail bed. This would prevent the nail in that area from growing back. In a very severe case, the doctor might remove the whole nail. The doctor might do these procedures with:A laser
A chemical called phenol
Electricity
Small surgical cuts
