Do one hole and screw at a time. Don't try drilling all the holes, then installing screws...you'll drive yourself crazy trying to find which knob you drilled.
 You can purchase "tire liners" (there are a few brands include Slime and Mr. Tuffy) that are designed to go in between the tube and the tire instead of using duct tape to protect the tube.
 Getting the tires mounted on the rims will be difficult, comparable to wrestling a rabid porcupine.
