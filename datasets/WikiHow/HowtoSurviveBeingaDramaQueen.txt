 Yes you think it's so cruel that the math teacher put you the farthest place possible from your friends but people may not appreciate it as much, especially if you go over it 30 times.;
, People have their own lives to live and will not always have time the time to cheer you up over little things. On the flip side if you're super happy hyper all the time, that's going to be hard to take too. Feel what you need to feel, but not too extremely unless it's for good reason.
 Nobody likes a baby.
 You probably love the limelight but if you chase it, it'll run away from you.
 Reading books, seeing and participating in theatre will really get your inner drama queen going. It can be a really great output.
 There's many different reasons why you weren't picked for the lead. Just accept it and think of reasons in how you can improve. Take acting, singing and/or dancing lessons if you have to. Don't hold anything against the people who did get a good part.
 Acting is all about learning and you can from each and every part you have.
 You have the power to entertain people and make them laugh.
