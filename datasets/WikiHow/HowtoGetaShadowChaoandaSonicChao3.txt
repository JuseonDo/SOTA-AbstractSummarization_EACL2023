the sonic chao is a neutral chao, so to get one you have to either a) pet it equally with both sonic and shadow or b) get it so that it looks like it will be a shadow chao and then pet and feed it its favorite fruit only with a hero character.

people have often said that if you give your chao any other chaos drives,or animals then it will not become a shadow or sonic chao, this is false.

@summary
do all the steps for sonic but use a shiny yellow chao or gold chao and when it evolves the second time give it some power drives too, but also give it more run drives.

@article
, Sonic Chao are classified as Neutral/Run/Run Chao, which means they are Neutral (raised by both Hero and Dark evenly, or raised from birth in Sonic Adventure DX or the original Sonic Adventure), primarily run oriented at the time of first evolution. (you can change your chaos evolution path: I once changed my would be Neutral/Fly Chao into Neutral/Swim just before she evolved.). The second Run ( Neutral/Run/Run) means that, although you can still raise other stats besides run (give it other colored animals and drives), it is yet again primarily Run oriented. The Chao can change appearances still, as the Second Evolution (the one a Neutral/Run/Unevolved takes from Green to Blue with a blackish stomach) is gradual (it won't happen right away), and can change; a Neutral/Run/Run can easily become a Neutral/Run/Power with primarily Power (red) Chaos Drives and animals being given to it.
