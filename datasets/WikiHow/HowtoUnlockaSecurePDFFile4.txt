 You'll need to download the most recent version of both (e.g., the top link on the page).

When downloading Ghostscript, make sure you click the link in the "AGPL" column (not the "Commercial License" one).
 You'll do this by double-clicking a setup file and then following the on-screen instructions.

You'll need to install Ghostscript first since the GSView program runs using Ghostscript's code.
When installing GSView, you have to click Setup at the top of the pop-up window.
, If your document is user-locked, GSView won't be able to access its information., This is in the top left corner of the screen., It's toward the bottom of the drop-down menu., If not, you'll need to select it from the drop-down menu here., This is to the right of the "Device" section you were just in.,, You can name your file anything, but you'll need to type ".pdf" at the end of whatever you name it., Your selected PDF should now no longer have an owner-lock on it, meaning you can edit the information in it as you please.
