 The mesh bag helps to protect the delicate silk.
 Most washing machines have a "delicate" setting with a low temperature, which is ideal. Low heat can tighten the weave, causing it to shrink as the threads pull closer together.Use a mild detergent. Avoid chlorine bleach at all costs as it will damage the silk.
Check the silk periodically. You may choose to take the garment out after half a cycle. , This will remove the excess moisture. Do not wring out the garment, as this could damage the fabric.
 Unlike many other fabrics, silk retains its shape well, and will not stretch. You may hang it up to dry without harming it. Do not place in direct sunlight as this can fade the color, and avoid a wood drying rack as the silk can leave stains on the wood. Allow to dry nearly completely. At this point, you may choose to use a dryer to complete the drying process.


Put the garment in the dryer for five minutes at a time.Some tumble dryers have a silk setting. If yours does not, use a heatless air setting.
Check it often to make sure the silk isn't being damaged. You may want to set a timer to make sure it doesn't stay in the dryer too long. Once the garment has shrunk to your taste, remove.
