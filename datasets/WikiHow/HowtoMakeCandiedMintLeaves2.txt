 Pull the leaves off the stalk, making sure to leave the stems on the leaves. This will make the leaves easier to handle; you can always trim the stems at the end. Rinse the leaves in cool water and lightly pat them dry with a paper towel.


If you going to decorate a cake with these, choose ones that look nice. Don't pick any that are bruised or torn.
 You can do this the microwave or over the stove. This will make the corn syrup easier to brush on.
 This will help make the corn syrup stickier and less likely to slide off. When brushing the mixture on, try to do it as thinly as possible. You don't need a lot for the sugar to stick.
 Coat them as evenly as possible, and don't worry if the sugar layer appears thick. You will be shaking the excess off at the end.
 Make sure that the leaves aren't touching or overlapping, or you won't be able to coat them evenly.
 Don't re-use any of the sugar from the first round. It will be damp from the corn syrup and clump up. Also, don't shake off any of the excess sugar; let it sit on the leaves., Don't cover the leaves with anything while they are drying.
 You can eat them as a treat, or use them as a garnish for cakes, drinks, pastries, or even ice cream.
