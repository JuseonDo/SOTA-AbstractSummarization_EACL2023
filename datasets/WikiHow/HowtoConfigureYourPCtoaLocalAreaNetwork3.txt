 You'll see this in your System Tray. If you are connecting your computers through a switch with no router, you'll need to assign each computer on the network its own individual IP address. This process is handled automatically if you're using a router.


Think of an IP address as a mailing address. Each computer on the network needs a unique IP address so that information sent across the network reaches the correct destination.
, You'll see this next to "Connections."

,, Make sure you don't uncheck it, just highlight it.
,,,,, This will save the settings for that computer. This computer is now configured on your network with a unique IP address.
 Follow the steps above on the second computer to open the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties window.
, Notice that the final group of numbers has incremented by 1.
 These values should be the same as they were on the first computer (255.255.0.0 and 192.168.0.0 respectively).
 Repeat these steps for each additional computer, incrementing the IP address by 1 each time (up to 255). The "Subnet mask" and "Default gateway" fields should be the same on each computer.
