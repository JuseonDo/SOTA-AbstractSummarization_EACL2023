The duct tape will limit the amount of glass that drops if the mirror shatters during removal.
 You can also use a small heat lamp.


Blow-dry each area of the glass evenly. Focus the heat on the heavily glued areas if you know where the glue is.



Because you will be working on removing the mirror from the wall, it's important to have a helper there to catch the mirror in case it slips down rapidly. This is especially important for larger mirrors.
 Use a long putty knife.
 Make a sawing motion with your hands. This separates the glue on the mirror from the wall.
, Use a pry bar once most of the glue has been sawed through.
