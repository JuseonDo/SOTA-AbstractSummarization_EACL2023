, The hooks should be stable and should be ready to be baited.
 Hook the pieces of bait onto the shower hooks and snap them shut to lock in the bait. If you have fish heads, hook through the eye and out the mouth. If you have chicken necks, poke the hook through the part of the neck with the most meat.
 At the end of the chain, tie another piece of rope (approx 5 ft), and then tie this to the buoy.
 Then tie the other ends of these rope to the buoys such that the weight rope and the trout line form a “V.”
