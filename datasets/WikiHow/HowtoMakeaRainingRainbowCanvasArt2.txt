 If you're painting a realistic rainbow, you will need shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, depending on your taste.


If you're creating a rainbow that's differently colored, choose the appropriate paint colors. You could use pastels, psychedelic colors, your favorite colors, etc. It's art, so use your creativity.
Use poster or acrylic paints. Oils and watercolors won't work very well with this project. Cheap, runny paints are a good option.
 Cover the area you'll be working on with paper to protect it. Squeeze out the paints into separate pots in readiness for painting. Have the paintbrushes ready to go.
 Work very quickly, as you don't want the paint to dry before blowing it.
 You only need airflow, not hear for the paint.
 Allow the paint to run down the canvas in any direction it wishes to go. You'll need to keep working quickly.
, When dry, the canvas is ready to hang on the wall.
