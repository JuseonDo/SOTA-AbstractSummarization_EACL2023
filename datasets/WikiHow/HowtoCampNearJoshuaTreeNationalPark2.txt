 The dirt roads to the location are well maintained and easily navigable in an RV. The area is popular with dune buggies, dirt bikers, and firework fanatics so it may not guarantee you a quiet night of sleep.

Turn left (north) on Sunfair road and travel about 2 miles (3.2 km) to Broadway.
Turn right on Broadway and drive about 1 mile (1.6 km) till you see a street with a line of telephone poles running perpendicular to Broadway. This one lane dirt road is Cascade.
Turn left (north) on Cascade for about .5 miles (0.80 km). You will pass a single lane, unmarked dirt road named Sunflower.
 Set up camp at least 300 feet (91.4 m) away from the road.
, No trash, water or bathroom facilities are provided.
