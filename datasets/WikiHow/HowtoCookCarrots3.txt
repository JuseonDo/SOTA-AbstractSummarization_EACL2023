 Cut off any tops. Decide whether to cook whole or sliced.
 For a steaming basket or saucepan, the water should be kept below the base of the steamer and carrots. Bring the water to the boil.


If you own a steamer machine, follow its instructions.
 Cover well with a fitted lid.
 This will take about 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the carrots. Check regularly after about 8 minutes.
 Steamed carrots go well with many meals and can be served individually or from a bowl. Keep them warm when serving at large dinners by placing in a container with a lid.
