@summary
make a sketch of your project to determine the size and shape of your own model.

@summary
build a box from 1x6 foot (30cm x 180cm) softwood lumber to form the walls of your cabin.

@summary
saw the limbs along their length.

@summary
cut enough strips to provide enough veneer to cover the whole cabin, excluding waste (which will be considerable).

@summary
start at the bottom on either side, and miter the ends of one of the bark slabs.

@summary
work up the first side until the whole side is covered with the slabs.

@summary
start the adjoining side of the box with the slabs.

@summary
continue running slabs up the side you are currently working on until it is completely covered.

@summary
build "rafters" with thin strips of the softwood lumber.

@summary
erect a "ridge beam" between the "gable ends" for the rafters to fasten to, then fasten each rafter in place, measuring the distances so they are equally spaced.

saw thin strips of the softwood lumber to make "shingles".

seal the logs and shingles with a polyurethane sealer or varnish so the bark doesn't peel when the wood dries.

 There are some unique methods involved in the project, so be prepared to do a little hunting for them. Here is a short list of special materials you will need:

Limbs to split to create the faux logs.
Lumber for building the frame and other components.;
, The one in the illustrations is 10 inches (25cm) wide, 12 inches (30cm) long, and 12 inches (30cm) high to its peak., Cedar or white pine are good materials for this step since they are easy to work with and will make fastening the veneer logs easier.
 Cut off the bark and a thin slab off the side of each limb. A table saw makes this easier, but if you clamp the limb or fasten it so it won't move, this step can be done with a circular saw as well., For the project in the photos, about 30 feet (9.1 meters) of bark slabs roughly 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thick were used.
 This is to ensure that the short length of the 45 degree angles are flush with the ends of the frame (box).
 You can use staples, screws, or brads to fasten the slabs. Ensure that the fasteners don't penetrate though the inside of the box or they will need to be trimmed flush or sanded off for safety.
 Match the mitered ends of the logs so they fit together closely. You will need to choose slabs that are about the same width to make them fit well., Then continue around the box until it the whole thing is wrapped with the "logs"., Cut the angles so they fit together properly. You can calculate your roof pitch and use a rafter square to make accurate cuts if you like, or just fit them by trial and error until you have a pattern rafter, then use it to mark the number you need for your project.,, Fasten them, starting from the eave and allowing the upper to overlap the lower, working up the roofline.


 Marking the roof strips to trim off straight.
, Alternatively, sand these details smooth.
 It's now ready to use as a pet home, mailbox or a decorative item for your home or garden.
