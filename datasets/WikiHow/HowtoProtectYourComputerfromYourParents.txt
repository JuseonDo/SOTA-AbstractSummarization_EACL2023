 This is key. You'll want a distinct password, I've been able to guess a lot of my friends' passwords, just to show them how easy it is. You'd be surprised how many people have their username as their password. So make the password a secret obsession you have, or something from your childhood or even a random object e.g.: 'CD case'.;
, Almost 75% of the time, people will stop going into your account if you make them their own. Be sure to give them limited access, unless you want them to be able to access your account.
 Here's what you do: go to your desktop. Right-click and make a compressed zipped folder. Name it Desktop Stuff or whatever you want. Put all of your desktop files except My Computer and Recycling Bin, into the file. Then go into the folder, and click file, add password. Add one, different from your username. It can be a simpler one, but not easy! if you are an advanced user, make an encrypted file container with FreeOTFE or truecrypt.
, One, set your History to 0 days to keep, by clicking Tools > Internet Options, in Internet Explorer. Also in Tools > Internet Options, clear your history every time after you use the Internet.

 Parents won't check it, and it's easy to clear everything but your favorites - Tools, Clear Private Data.
 Using this feature allows you to surf internet in a way that no history is saved in the browser.
 This will encrypt your password with another password to make using software such as Ophcrack to crack the password much more difficult.
