“Gregory, B.”
In this case, you only use the author’s first initial.
 Center for Happy People.”

,


“Gregory, B. Center for Happy People. (2008).”

, Put the title in sentence case, meaning only the first word is capitalized:


“Gregory, B. Center for Happy People. (2008). Why chocolate is the best antidepressant”

,


“Gregory, B. Center for Happy People. (2008). Why chocolate is the best antidepressant (DHHS Publication No. ADM 4343-13434).”

, Note that APA uses “DC” instead of “D.C.” and that it uses “U.S. Government Printing Office” not just “Government Printing Office.


“Gregory, B. Center for Happy People. (2008). Why chocolate is the best antidepressant (DHHS Publication No. ADM 4343-13434). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.”

,


“Willow, L. Green Foods. (2007). Chocolate for life: a report on the health benefits of chocolate. Eugene, Oregon: Redbook Printers.”

,


“Chocolate is the best (Willow, 2007, p. 35).” Notice they are separated by commas.
You can also use the name at the beginning of the sentence without parenthesis, followed by a date in parenthesis:
“According to the Center for Happy People (2008), chocolate is awesome (p. 46).” The page number always comes at the end of the sentence.
