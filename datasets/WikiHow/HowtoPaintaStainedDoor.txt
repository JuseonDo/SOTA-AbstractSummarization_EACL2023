Select oil base primer paint for the first coat.






If you are painting over stained cedar or redwood, ask an experienced paint store clerk to help you choose the proper primer to cover those woods.






Choose either oil-base paint or acrylic latex paint for the second coat and finish coats. Read the label on latex paints to make sure they can be painted over oil primer.
Choose exterior or interior paint depending on where the door surface will be. A gloss or semi-gloss finish is best for exterior surfaces. Semi-gloss or “eggshell” finish is best for interior door sides.
Choose an acrylic clear sealer to cover the paint after it dries to prolong the life of the paint and make it easier to clean.
For an average-sized door, you will need 1 quart of each kind of paint and sealer. (You will need 2 quarts of finish paint if each side of the door is a different color.);

Leave one half of the hinge attached to the doorframe to make it easier to re-hang the door.






If you can’t remove the door for some reason you will need to protect the doorframe and nearby walls with painters tape.
