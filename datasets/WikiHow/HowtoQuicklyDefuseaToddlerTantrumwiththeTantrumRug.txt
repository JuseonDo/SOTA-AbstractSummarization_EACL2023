@summary

@summary
when telling the child that they cannot throw the tantrum 'here', pull out the "tantrum rug".

@summary
tell the child while picking them up (this obviously only works with small children), that they may only throw tantrums on the tantrum rug.

@summary
take them to the rug and gently put them on the rug.

@summary
because the adult has made a choice about the tantrum and is now controlling the environment, the tantrum usually loses appeal.

@summary

@summary
do this whole process with as much calm as possible.

@summary
when the child has stopped the tantrum (often this happens the instance they touch the rug) ask if they are done or if they want to stay on the rug a bit longer?

@summary

@summary
as soon as the tantrum is over, pick the child up and give them a hug, tell them you are proud of them for learning to act nicely and ask if they want to put the rug away…then put the rug away.

 This also includes learning to control the adults in their environment.;
, When a toddler begins to throw a tantrum, it will be indicated by yelling, thrashing, kicking, holding their breath, flailing arms, etc. The tantrum may include any or all of these behaviours.
 This can be a mat or towel or something, that has a well defined area. It should be readily accessible to the child during the anti-tantrum training period. Preferably it should be an object you do not want to keep long term or that will be kept in a cupboard or out of sight most of the time.
 You could say, "When you act this way, people do not know you are nice."or "when you throw a tantrum, it makes everything that is nice about you hide". Children are much more sophisticated in their understanding than most give them credit for.


They should be told the truth about how their behaviour affects other's opinions of them, even if they are very young. They may appear not to hear or understand what you are saying, but say it anyway.
 This is the key. The tantrum is the child controlling their environment in an inappropriate way. The adults in the child's life need to teach the child that tantrums are an unacceptable way to control their environment.



Place the 'rug' in an area less central to the room, (usually toddlers tantrum are thrown centre stage). Lay the rug in a safe place away from heaters, stairs, doors, sharp objects or heavy things that can be toppled like bookshelves.
, Sit beside them and without raising your voice explain calmly that this is the only place they can throw the tantrum. If they try to roll off the rug, calmly roll them back on and tell them repeatedly that until the tantrum is over that this is the only place they can kick and scream like that. If the child is striking at you, stand and step away, only moving in to put the child back on the rug.
, Even if you are certain that the child has no idea what you are saying or can even hear your words, still speak them in a controlled manner.
,, Most children only need a few 'tantrum rug tantrums' to accept that they are not in control of the adult or their environment.
