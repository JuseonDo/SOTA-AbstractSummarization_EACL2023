@summary
if you have been married for less than 2 years, you are required to seek counselling for the relationship.
@article
 This is a requirement under section 48(2) Family Law Act. You must have lived both separately and apart for at least 12 months.


One party must consider the marriage to be over and to have communicated this to the other spouse.
It is possible to be separated but still live under the same roof but you will need to prove this to the judge.;
, Alternatively, seek the Court's permission for a divorce.
