, Using the socket ended crossbar, loosen the lug nuts on the left or right front tire (the side you start on does not mater). Put a block of wood behind the opposite side tire to make sure the car does not move when jacking or working.
 When jacking up your car, make sure to use the dealer specified jacking points first; if you feel the dealer specified jacking points are not safe simply use the pinch weld, as close as you feel is safe to the dealer jacking points

, Make sure the jack stands and car do not move.
, Remove the caliper mounting bolts using the socket set. After the bolts have been removed, tie the caliper to the coil spring making sure the hydraulic line stays attached to the caliper. Take notice of where the bolts are removed from.
, Take notice of which holes the bolts come out of.
 The rotor may be difficult to get off due to rust and/or friction, but the rotor simply pulls off

, Most professional mechanics prefer to clean the braking surface with brake clean fluid before installation. This is not mandatory step but it is preferable to remove manufacturing compounds that may be left over., Rotors, brake pads, and brake pad clips should all be replaced together as a set, as they affect how the rotors and pads wear while in operation.
 Remember to put the bolts and mount back in the original position they were removed from. There is no torque spec for this component but it should not move at all. Tighten until the component is stable on the car.



A second person will be needed for the step. Untie the caliper from the coil spring and set aside the wire. It will not be needed further for the current side. Using the C-clamp, compress the piston all the way down.
 There is no torque spec for this step but the caliper should be secured to the mounting bracket.
, Torque specs can be found in your vehicle owner's manual.
 Lower the car back down to the ground.
