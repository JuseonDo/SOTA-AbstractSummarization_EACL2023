d5 - Copying whites move is the logical response to this attack, and is likely to happen in a game scenario.
 White has placed black in an uncomfortable position; either take the hanging pawn and accept the positional disadvantage or decline and stay materially equal.
dxc4 - Black has chosen to accept the Queens Gambit; in continuations of this line black struggles to protect the weak pawn on c4.
 This is because White now completely dominates the center leaving black with closed center and a hanging pawn.
