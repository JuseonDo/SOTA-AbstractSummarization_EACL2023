Depending on the recipe you are using the “rice” for, you can add some chopped onion or minced garlic to the oil before adding the cauliflower., This is called “dry frying”, without any added liquid like water or broth. This will help to remove as much moisture from the “rice” as possible.The cauliflower flavor will also mellow and become almost nutty, kind of like brown rice.
 Keep an eye on the “rice” as it cooks. It should start to turn a nice golden brown color and soften.
 Use the fried “rice” as side dish for other protein like meat, fish, or tofu.


You can also use fried cauliflower rice as a substitute for noodles in stir fries or for fried rice.
