 Make sure the trail you plan to follow is within your hiking and endurance capabilities. Check the weather report for the day you plan to hike. Try to be off the peak as early as possible to avoid afternoon thunderstorms and lightning.;
, You may be trying to summit in one day or take a multi-day backpacking trip. Either way, ensure you have proper equipment and survival gear.
 Provide specifics including: vehicle make, model and license number; who you are traveling with; trailhead; and planned route.
 Lightning is especially hazardous above treeline. Storms have a greater chance of forming in the afternoon. Plan to descend below treeline as early in the day as possible.
 If possible, take a break only every 30 minutes. Don't rush at the start and be sure to give yourself enough water breaks.
 The lightheadedness is from a lack of oxygen to your brain. Resting will make more blood available for your noggin'.
,, Be careful not to run and trip. The downward hike is often more strenuous on the legs and feet than hiking uphill.
