 On your Home screen or App Drawer, look for the Google Play Store app and tap it.;
, In the search bar, type in “Volume+” and tap the one by the developer Meltus.
, It may either be in the Home screen or the App Drawer.
,,,, Max Volume Levels can be changed in the "Volume Level" menu. Too much may cause distortion, so test as you go.
 You can do this through the "Bass Enhance" menu.
 This can be changed through the last menu in the Basic Settings. This manipulates echo effects.
 Headset settings have the same menus as the Speaker Settings.
 Again, these have the same steps as Speaker settings.
