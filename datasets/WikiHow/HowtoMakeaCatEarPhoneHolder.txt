 and make a template for the cat body.
 Usually one uses it for bags, to give it more body. Some cardboard would also do., Careful! Switch sides for the second cut out! Cut the fabric slightly larger than what you have marked. It will be corrected soon, but don't cut it too small., Take some glue that is not too strong so that you can move the fabric after you have stuck it on. The glue is just to hold it in place when you sew it., It's easier to sew (you won't accidentally sew in “thin air”),, Take in account that the tail has to be larger than you think, it has to accommodate the cable and everything. Try it out before you sew it. Then put a button.,,
