@article
 Don't throw a party before asking your parents' permission.;
, If they don't, then you can invite them to the party! Invite as many friends as can fit into your house. If you invite more, it will be too cramped.
 A tiki or Hawaiian theme is a good choice. If you don't want a theme, you don't have to!

, It's not a party if there is no food. Choose snacks that are sweet, salty, and delicious. Buy a chip platter, a couple of bottles of soda, and some sandwiches. If your parents are willing, have them prepare some hamburgers and hot dogs on the BBQ.
 Get out the Wii or any other game console, dig out the baseball stuff, and rent a movie! If the party is outside, you can play tug-of-war or have a water bomb war!

, Fill the pool with floats and rafts and toys. Set up a small folding table with lemonade and chips for guests to snack on.
 Your friend's parents may be working and may want to be present at the party. If this is not the case, set the party anytime of the week!

, It may not be a good idea.
 Hang streamers and decorate the house with balloons and crepe paper. If you have a tiki themed party, give out leis and play the ukulele.
 Tell scary stories in the dark, watch movies, eat popcorn, read books, and whatever you do, try not to sleep!

, Hold a race in three different forms: foot race, bike race, and swimming race and award the winners with small prizes.
 Try out such things as hula hooping, whistling with two fingers, baking or cooking, basketball, baseball, and other outdoor games.
 You could try classes in sculpting, sketching, doodling cartoons, or painting with different techniques and different paints.
 Use it to document your everyday memories of the summer. At the end, you'll have something amazing to read.
, Spend the whole party having fun and not once think of school.
 As with the beginning-of-summer vacation party, have with drinks, food, movies, and a huge variety of contests for everyone.
