 This is a basic problem with using a router. To briefly describe this issue, when you are connected to your ISP through either your cable or DSL modem, you are given 1 IP (Internet Protocol) address. If you have a router, you have the ability to connect multiple computers to the internet using that one 1 IP address (ex: 69.48.100.5). Now when an incoming connection request arrives for a given port, in this case 2234, the router doesn't know which computer to send the request to (even if you only have 1 computer!), because it could be any of the computer connected to the router. So to fix this problem you need to set up port forwarding to on your router.
 See the website PortForward.com for information on assigning a static IP address. If you only have 1 computer connected to the router, chances are it receives the same internal IP address each time it connects. (Ex: 192.168.0.1), so you can skip this step.
 For each router this is explained in detail at PortForward. Pick your router and go through the steps that they list.
