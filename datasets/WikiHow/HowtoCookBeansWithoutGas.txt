, The kind of bean you cook will also make a difference. Pick one variety of bean to "specialize in" while you and your body are learning to cook and eat it. Most health food stores have bulk bins where you can buy them cheaply by the pound.


Ethnic markets (Hispanic, Asian, Indian, etc.) will often have good prices on 5 or 10 pound bags, so consider stocking up. You can also find very affordable spices there.
, This is the clear fluid that forms on the top of yogurt and full of friendly bacteria that can help "pre-digest" the hard coating on the beans. (Or, just mix in a tablespoon of plain yogurt.)

,,, This could be extra virgin olive oil, butter, virgin coconut oil or even animal fat (like bacon.) A good oil makes it easier for our bodies to absorb the nutrients in beans.
 If you don't have a recipe, try 1 teaspoon of chili powder (Mexican flavor), marsala (Indian), or 5 Spices (Asian)


One spice that specifically helps reduce gas in beans is asafetida or hing. Try 1/4 tsp. at first and increase to 1 tsp. if gas is still a problem.
 Add more water, if necessary.
