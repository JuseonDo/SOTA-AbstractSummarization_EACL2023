 Try to pick one that is fairly large, empty or nearly empty, and is not too difficult to reach inside. An old pharmacy prescription bottle is a good option.


Do not use a bottle that has the cap missing.;
, Keep them in a Ziploc baggy or, if they are expired, toss them.
 If not, choose a larger bottle.
 Peel off the stickers that you can. If it's a prescription bottle, scribble over the top of the cap with permanent marker.


If you are using a prescription bottle, scribble over any stickers with black permanent marker before throwing them away. If there are any stickers remaining on the bottle that you are unable to remove, take a fork and scrape away at it over a trash bin. That way, no dumpster divers can find your personal medical information.
 Start with the earphone jack and move up your finger slightly.
 Put your thumb at the tip of the coiling finger and your index finger at the root. Slowly pinch them together to maintain the earbuds' coil.
 It is a good idea to have the earpieces at the top so you can retrieve them easily.
