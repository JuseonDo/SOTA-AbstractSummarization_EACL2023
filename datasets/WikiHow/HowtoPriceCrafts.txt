 Most likely you are creating your crafts at home, so you must consider how much of your week is working time.;
, If you don't want to make less than $10 an hour and you're crafting 40 hours a week, you will need to price your crafts so that you make at least $400 if you sell the entire inventory.
 If your pieces aren't too time consuming, you may be able to price each piece at a reasonably competitive price. If one piece takes you more than an hour, each piece must be priced a little higher to compensate you for the time.
 Check out trade shows and craft fairs to get a good idea of what other crafters are charging.
 Find out how much crafting sites charge for fees and allowing you to list your crafts. You will need to include this fee when calculating the cost of your crafts.
 While selling on consignment can help improve your business, you may have to raise your prices in order to cover the overhead costs plus the consignment fee.
, Different formulas work, but one of the easier ones is multiplying your overhead costs by the amount of money you want to make each week and divide it by the number of units you're able to produce a week. The total is the amount you should charge per piece.
 As the economy changes, your overhead will change. If you rely on only one formula to determine how to price your crafts, it will be hard to make changes when aspects affecting the cost and price of your crafts change.
