@summary
these guys have no ranged weapons, so impact gummis are key.

 With impact Gummis they will take damage each time they hit you. Equip some Gungnir-Gs for an easy kill.
 They will cross your line of fire regularly anyway. Besides, if you've got Auto-Lock Lasers they will seek it out automatically.
