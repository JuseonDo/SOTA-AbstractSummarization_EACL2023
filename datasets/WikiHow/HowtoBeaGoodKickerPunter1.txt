 You can do this by running or other leg related exercises.;
, That way, you will get more air under it and it will go farther.
 It will make it seem you like you don't know your own strength. Instead, try to kick it inside the ten, that way you have made a good kick and it forces the opponent to run out of their deep territory.
 If you kick to the right or left it will slice that way. Also, be aware of the wind direction and aim accordingly.
