 Finer teeth make for a smoother cut, essential to make learning how to use a saw easier. Larger toothed saws are used for cuts where accuracy can be sacrificed for cutting speed.;
, A dull saw makes sawing highly unpleasant.
 Hold the wood down or clamp it into place so it that will not move. Mark the location where you will make the cut.
 Make sure the cut location is off the sawhorse or not in between the sawhorses.
 Keep fingers clear of the area to be cut.
 Use a straight piece of wood to keep the saw in line with the line you wish to cut. Slowly draw the blade of the saw on the mark on the wood at a 45 degree angle.
, Do not let the blade come off the wood.
 Let the saw do the work. Using too much force will make the saw bite into the wood, getting it stuck, possibly leading to you bending the saw.
 It is not a knife, so do not try to use it as one.
 As long as you see sawdust coming from the wood, it is being cut.
 Support the piece that is being cut off with your hand if possible.
