 You may already have one, but making a new one with a fresh start is so much easier. Give your model a username like "Isolah Lynne", "Bibelot", "Lovelytoes", "..Diamond.", "Catinka", "edimir", or "ExPo". Just don't include numbers. Make her look sophisticated, yet add some of your own taste into it. Remember, you need to make a good first impression on the fellow models. Also, being different is the new fad here, which a lot of people are not. When choosing the hair, anything is fine, it's just to get you started.;
, At some point, you will get one if you click "Yes". Mentors are a must, because they are usually very friendly, and are willing to be friends (add) with their Mentee. There is a friend for you, right there!

, After a while, you will be a catalogue model.
 This will make the girls think you are dedicated and focused. But don't spend all your time on here, that just looks silly, and it makes other models think that you spend your whole life on here. After some time, mail some of the popular models and leave them nice comments. After a while of simple chit-chat, start talking about more serious conversations. This gets them hooked.
 What about fame? Play 5 photo shoots a day. Get a fashion magazine, for those don't cost very much and can keep you updated on what to wear. Play Dancer as many times as you can, and try Wardrobe Challenge. You must be patient, you won't become a Supermodel in a week. Try a month or 2.
 Save up your goMoney, and don't waste it on useless crap. Try to change your hairstyle every 2 months if possible, and change clothes if you can every week. This keeps your model looking new and fresh. Look at what others are wearing, and what's popular.
 You have tons of friends, are popular, famous, and rich. Use your status for good, not bad.
