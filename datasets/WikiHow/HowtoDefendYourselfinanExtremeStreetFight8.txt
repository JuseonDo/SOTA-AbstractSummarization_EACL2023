 As with many attack moves, recognizing the move that's about to happen is a big part of defensive strategy. Signs to look for include:Formation of a fist
Gritting teeth, angry jaw movements
Shallow, forced breathing
Once foot suddenly shifted in front
Chin drops (to protect the throat)
Shoulder drops (this is where the power of the punch starts)
Body turns to side, away from you.
 By the time a person has made a decision to punch, they've already decided where that punch is going to land and have done with their strategizing. You, on the other hand, have a split second to change where that punch lands. So if it's coming for your head, move your head just a fraction and the punch may well miss or at least have much less force than originally intended., Here it helps to make an educated guess as to your opponent's next moves. This is not about making a wild guess, but requires that you make a plausible and educated guess.
