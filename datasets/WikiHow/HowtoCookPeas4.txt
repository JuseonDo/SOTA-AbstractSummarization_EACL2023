 The peas will still release more liquid as you heat them up. If you leave the sauce in while cooking them, they may get too mushy.
 You can add a knob of butter, a dash of salt, and a sprinkle of pepper. You can also add a squeeze of lemon juice as well., Canned peas are already cooked, so they just need to be reheated. How warm you want them to be is entirely up to youâ€”just be careful not to overheat them! They should be ready in just 1 or 2 minutes, however.
 Canned peas make a great side dish, but they will also taste wonderful in sauces and soups!
