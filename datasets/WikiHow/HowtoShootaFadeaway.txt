 It doesn't matter which shoulder is closest to the basket. By standing sideways to the basket, you will be able to prevent defenders from stealing the ball.;
, This tactic will fool your defender into thinking you are going to make a drive toward the basket.
 Take a full step backwards with your foot that is the closest to the basket. While you are taking a step backward, turn your shoulders square to the basket. You should turn and step backwards in a single fluid motion.
 With both feet, quickly jump into the air, angling your jump so you are jumping away from the basket.
 Do this while jumping in the air in preparation to shoot the basketball towards the net.
 With the momentum you gain from jumping in the air and raising the basketball, shoot the basketball towards the basketball goal.


Snap your wrist towards the basket when shooting the basketball to help propel the ball.
