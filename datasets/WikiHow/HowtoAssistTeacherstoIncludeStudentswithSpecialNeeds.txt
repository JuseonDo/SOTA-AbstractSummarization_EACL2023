, Be specific and to the point.
 What is her/his case load, experience with children with special needs, educational level, years of teaching, and interests in the educational field?

, Be polite. Explain that you would like some information about special education inclusion in her/his school at the meeting (not over the phone). Give the teacher a chance to do some research if she/he does not have the answer at her/his fingertips.
 The purpose of the meeting is to help the child, not to blame any party of past behaviors. Most teachers are not on the opposite side of the fence. They are teachers because they care about children. Certainly not in it for the money!

, Try to follow an agenda so that you can accomplish what you need. If you are not achieving your goal, ask the team to consider your issues and reconvene at a date in the near future.
 Be gracious. You will get a better attitude from teachers when they see that you are sincere in helping your student, not just coming to bash them for what you think is a job poorly done.
 If you are asked to compromise, where can you comply and where can you not comply? What is appropriate for your child?

, Include issues of social skills, behavior modeling, life experiences, teacher expertise, your dreams for your child and your helpfulness in any way.
 Be patient but persist with your follow through.
