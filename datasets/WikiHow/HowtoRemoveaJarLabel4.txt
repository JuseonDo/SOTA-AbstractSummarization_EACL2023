 If the label is stuck firmly to the jar, soak the jar in warm, soapy water for a few minutes, then peel the label off. You will likely have lots of paper and/or glue residue left over, which is fine., You can use any cooking oil, such as canola oil, olive oil, or vegetable oil.Baby oil will also work in a pinch.


For a small-sized jar, you will need about 1 tablespoon of each.Plain olive oil may work for light, glue reside.You will need the abrasive baking soda if there is paper, however.
 Focus on the areas that have the most residue. You can rub it on using your fingers, a paper towel, or even a cloth.
 It will make it easier to remove later on.
 This will allow the baking soda to scrub off any glue or paper residue.
 If you see any residue, you can wipe it off using a paper towel and a few drops of oil.
