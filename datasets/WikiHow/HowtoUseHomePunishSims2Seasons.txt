 And if it's snowing, raining or hot outside, make them go outside if they don't do their chores fast.;
, Without watching TV, make them do it outside, or upstairs in their quiet room.
 Unless they have A+ grades.
 Only healthy things and nutritious things.
 And if they don't have at least an A-, don't let them watch TV or play a game until they raise their grades. Though make sure they read books to keep their fun up.
