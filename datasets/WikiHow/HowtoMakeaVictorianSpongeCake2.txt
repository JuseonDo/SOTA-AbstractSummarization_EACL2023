 Leave to stick (perhaps put in the refrigerator).
 Sift the icing sugar into a clean bowl, and then add the butter. Mix until it forms a butter icing. Alternatively, use an electric mixer on slow-medium speed until the mixture comes.
 Mix. If runny, add more icing sugar/put in refrigerator.
 Sandwich the two cakes together (the plain cake goes on top of the icing and the jam). Sprinkle the top of the cake with a bit of icing sugar or icing made from vanilla sugar (zucchero vanigliato in Italian).
