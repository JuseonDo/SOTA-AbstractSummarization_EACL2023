 If the fabric is dirty, you will need to wash it and let it dry completely., Linseed oil can get pungent, so the extra ventilation might help keep you from feeling lightheaded. If you are working outside, make sure that the area is free of dust and that there is no wind, or you might end up with dust particles embedded in your finished piece. If you cannot work outside, then make sure that you have a window open., You can use a cheap picture frame with the glass and cardboard backing taken out. Make sure that the fabric covers the entire frame. If the fabric is too big for the frame, then you will need to work on it in parts., You can also use jojoba oil. It is a little lighter than linseed oil, which might make it easier to work with., You want the fabric to be completely saturated with the oil. Don't worry if it feels like you are using too much; you will be wiping the excess off. You can apply the oil with a wide, boar bristle paintbrush or with a rag.

Avoid using a brush made from camel hair. The soft bristles will be too weak to spread the oil.
If the oil came in a small bottle, then consider pouring it into a large cup,

, This will give the oil enough time to soak into the fabric and saturate it. After this time, you may notice some residue on the surface of the fabric. Use a clean cloth to wipe it off., Wait 30 minutes, then wipe the excess oil off using a clean rag. You can add one or two more layers., Use an oil painting paintbrush to apply the oil paint. These brushes are usually made out of stiff bristles, such as boar bristles or Taklon, which is synthetic. Apply the linseed oil with a brush instead of a rag so that you do not blur your design.
