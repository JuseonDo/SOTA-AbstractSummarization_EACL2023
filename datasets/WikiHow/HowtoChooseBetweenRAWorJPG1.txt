If you don't plan on any post processing, then consider using *.jpg.
 If you are prone to using the wrong settings, then you might want to consider *.raw. RAW files tend to be a little more recoverable.
 This gives you the more-or-less-finished JPGs for convenience, and the RAW files for careful editing where that may be desirable. The only cost is increased storage space consumption as well as possibly slightly reduced frame rate and buffer depth.
