Using Gantter requires you to have a SmartApp account. If you do, type in your email and password in the login form, then click on "Login".
 You will need to type in your first name, last name, an email address, password, and provided CAPTCHA code.


Make sure to type in a valid e-mail address, so you can confirm it once you have registered.






Also, make sure to read all the Terms of Service and privacy policies. Those are the documents you will need to agree to when you register.






If you do not want to register 'directly' for a SmartApp account, you can click on "Register with Google", "Register with Facebook" or "Register with Linkedin" instead. This will link your Google, Facebook or LinkedIn account to SmartApp/Gantter.
 Click on the link that you are given to confirm your e-mail, so you can start using your account for project management.
 The window includes the buttons "Project", "Edit", "View", "Actions", "Extensions" and "Help" at the top. You will also see the buttons "Tasks", "Resources", and "Calendars", at the near-bottom.


You will also see a chart in the "file" you are editing. There are 5 fields: Name, Duration, Start, Finish, Predecessors, and Resources.
 If you are managing more than one project at once, type in the name of each project.
 To do this, click on the Resources tab.


Type in the name of each resource under "Resource Name".
Type in the email for each resource.
Choose the type of resource that each one is, from the small drop-down. It can either be "Work" or "Material".
Type the cost for each resource, if any.
 The default ones are 'Standard', '24-Hours' and 'Night Shift'. You can, however, edit those and create your own 'custom' names.
