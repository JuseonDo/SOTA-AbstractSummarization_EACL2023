 There are tons of interesting Sims in the neighborhood. Make sure you have a Sim that has personalities that suit your Sim like:


Artistic
Athletic
and more!;
, Greeting this Sim friendly (if you haven't met him or her) is going to benefit your relationship a lot more, rather than greeting them rudely. If you have a high Charisma skill level, then use a different good greeting like, "Charming Greeting" or "Loving Greet".
 Go to 'Friendly' then 'Get to Know' to find out about them.
 You first start out as an Acquaintance to every Sim (that is not in your family). Simply do friendly things in the 'Friendly' option. Make sure that your Sim doesn't do the same social interaction every time or the Sim that you are trying to impress will get bored. Also, if the other Sim has a trait like, Unflirty or Snob, then you might want to become Best Friends before you move onto the next step. Also become Best Friends before doing the next step if your Sim itself has the Unflirty trait.
, Some Sims like it and some don't. If this Sim doesn't like it, go to the 'Friend' option again and find 'Apologize'. However, sometimes 'Apologize' won't work and you will just creep the other Sim out. In this case, just do other social interactions until the Sim stops finding you creepy.
 Then click on that and see what this Sim says. There is a good chance the Sim will say yes.
 If you don't want your partner to be in your active household, skip the previous step, and this step.
 If the sim responds well, carry on using Flirty interactions (use different interactions each time - the 'Hopeless Romantic' or 'Flirty' trait will add more options to the Romantic menu).
 Click this. The relationship will hopefully change from 'Friend' or 'Best friend' to 'Romantic interest'.
 Wait until 'Propose going steady' appears.
