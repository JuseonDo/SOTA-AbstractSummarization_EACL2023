 There are 5 major areas of study in which students can audition at the Academy. For more information on these majors, visit the school website.;
, It is very important you prepare for your audition in advance.
 In order to be able to audition at the Academy, you will need to have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher. The requirement is not only for the Academy but other magnet schools in the Clark County School District.


Bring an official transcript to your audition in order to verify your grades.
 Each audition opportunity should be taken seriously, so plan to arrive 15-30 minutes early. You never know when you might run into bad traffic or get lost, and will need to rely on the extra buffer time. It reflects really poorly on the applicant to show up late.
 You can't change anything now, so there's no point in worrying about whether you will receive an acceptance or rejection letter. Take everything in stride.


If you know that you did your best, relish your efforts and pat yourself on the back. If you know that there were things you could improve on, make a list of those and keep that in mind for next time. Don't dwell on past mistakes; only use them as motivational tools for the future.
