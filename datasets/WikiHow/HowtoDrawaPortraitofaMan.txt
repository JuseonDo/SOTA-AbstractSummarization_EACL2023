 Halfway down the oval draw a horizontal line. This is the eye line, which is where the eyes will be placed. Next, draw a vertical line down the middle of the oval. This is the line of symmetry.;
, Find the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. There, draw a shape like a football. Next,draw an eye on both the left and right side of this football shape.There should be enough space to fit one eye on both the left and right side of the face. Erase the middle shape.
 Finally, draw a light line from the middle of both eyes down to the half-circle you have just drawn.
 This is the top of the mouth. Next, draw a triangle that connects the two corners of the mouth to the point formed by the intersection of the eye line and the line of symmetry. Above the mouth, draw a light line from one side of the triangle to the other. This is where the bottom of the line of the nose will be.The triangle is how wide the nose will be.
 Look at the person you want to draw and adjust your sketch. You might want to move the chin up and down or have more or less space between the eyes and the sides of the head. Draw a new shape for the face that looks more like who are you trying to draw. Then, draw the features: eyelids, eyeballs, eyebrows, a nose, an upper and lower lip, and cheekbones.
 Add hair, eyelashes, and the features of the ears and eyes. Keep erasing and drawing until you like the way your portrait looks.
