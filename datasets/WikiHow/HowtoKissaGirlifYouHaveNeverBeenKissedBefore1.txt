 Practice with the back of your hand in the privacy of your own room or when you are alone so you don't look strange because you are essentially kissing yourself.


To do this, you should open your mouth as wide as your index finger when you have it laying sideways over your mouth.
Put your lips gently over the back of your hand. You can move your lips in a circular motion, or pretend like you are lightly sucking the juice out of a fruit, like a plum.;
, Practice parting your lips in a circular motion.


You can also use your tongue, like you're gently pushing into the flesh of a soft fruit.
