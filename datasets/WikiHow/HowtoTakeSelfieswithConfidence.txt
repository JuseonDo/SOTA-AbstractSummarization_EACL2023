 Are you unconfident? Think about it, and ask yourself these questions. If you answer yes to any of these questions, you are probably insecure. Insecurity is a problem that seems to be sweeping the nation and destroying perfectly good selfies.


Do you take selfies but never post them online?
Are you constantly trying to hide a feature like a pimple or scar?
Do you always use filters?;
, If you think about it, you will be stuck with them for the rest of your life, so you should be happy with yourself.


Acne can be a huge selfie killer. If you have acne, try to treat it, and make sure to wash your face twice a day to prevent future breakouts.
 If your selfie mainly displays your clothing, the viewers will pay attention to your clothes and not your facial features.
 Is it your white teeth? Your golden hair? Whatever it is, make sure your selfie boasts your best feature and not your worst.
 If you have acne, using a filter can help the acne match your skin tone and look completely gone.
 If your insecurity is on one side of your face, turn that side of your head away from your phone, or make sure the lighting is on the other side.
 Photoshopped selfies seem to scream to the viewers, "This person is insecure!". Instead of using Photoshop, use the techniques above and the confidence boosters below.
 If you need to, focus on the background so your viewers attention is directed to the background, not your face.
 If you need to, look up "severe {your insecurity here}" and browse through Google Images.
 Tell yourself that everybody who likes the picture likes your appearance, and everybody that comments is complimenting you.
