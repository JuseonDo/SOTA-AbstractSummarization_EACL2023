, This will vary greatly on the amount of pasta you need for your projects. If you are doing crafts, you may only need 1/2 cup of pasta for each bowl, but if you are doing projects for a classroom, you may want to fill a large bag with a pack of pasta.
 Most sources suggest alcohol is the most effective. This is also called alcohol when it is sold in stores.









The liquid should cover all or most of the pasta.
 You should buy the drops, rather than the type. If you used about 1/2 cup (58 g) of alcohol, you should use drops of coloring. Increase the number of drops according to the amount of alcohol you used.

, If you are using a bag, you can puncture a hole in it over the sink and allow it to drain out.
