 After you disable then try the uninstall process.;
, Look for an icon labeled “Uninstall.” Click and follow the instructions to remove Spyware Doctor from your computer.
 Scroll down until you see Spyware Doctor and click “Uninstall.”

, Next, download and install a free uninstall program, such as Revo Uninstaller. Open the program and select Spyware Doctor for uninstallation. Click on “Options” and select “Advanced Mode.” Select and delete any registry items that appear during the uninstallation process.
 This software will forcibly and effectively get rid of any programs, their components and registry entries that cannot successfully be removed using the standard Windows “Add/Remove Programs” function.
 Use this uninstall method only if you are comfortable working with Windows’ registry.


Go to the “Start” button and select “Run” (Win + R for Vista users). Type in “regedit” and hit the return (“Enter”) key.
Locate “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall on the left side of the registry settings.
Scroll through the list of “keys” until you see the one with the key “DisplayName” Spyware Doctor. You also will see an “Uninstall String” key that points to the uninstall program.
Do not delete the key in which you located the “DisplayName” key with the “value” equal to the Spyware Doctor’s name or the program will no longer show up in the “Add/Remove Programs” list.
Open the folder where the uninstalled Spyware Doctor should be located. Search for files named “uninstal.log,” “setup.log” or something like that. Open this file using “Notepad” to see the list of all the files that were copied onto your hard drive and delete all the files.
