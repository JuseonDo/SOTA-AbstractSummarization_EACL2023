Go to the mine below Varrock East Bank.
Mine the copper and tin from the rocks.






Once you have a full inventory of copper and tin, either go to the Varrock east bank and store the ores, or drop them from your inventory (powermining).
Repeat this until you reach level 15.
Go to the bank and turn all of the copper and tin ore you have collected into bank notes.






Walk to the Grand Exchange, which is just above Varrock West bank, and sell your copper and tin.







Walk to the mine below Varrock and mine the iron rocks.






When you have a full inventory of iron ore, walk back to the Varrock East bank and store your iron there.
Repeat until you reach level 31.
Walk to the bank and turn all your iron ore into bank notes.






Walk to the Grand Exchange and sell your iron ore.
 If you have enough money, you can also buy a Rune Pickaxe to save you the trip later. Or go to the Grand Exchange as you'll pay less there!






Teleport to Lumbridge with the home teleport spell and go South until you reach a mine with only copper and tin ore. Then walk west until you see another mine with some coal rocks.






Mine coal.








When you have a full inventory of coal, go to Draynor Bank and drop the coal off there.






Repeat until you reach level 41.


Go to a bank and note your coal, then go to the Grand Exchange and sell them.
 If you do not have one, go to Nurmof's and buy one.






Mine coal or mithril ore. Mithril is worth more, but it takes a longer time to mine.
Mine and bank until you reach a mining level of 60.
 Congratulations on making it this far!

, Now you can mine adamantite ore, which is very valuable! There is a door on the other side of the mines leading to the Dwarven mines, an absolutely great area to get gold and melt to sell as gold bars which will make a lot of RS Cash., Now you can mine the greatest ore of all: Rune!, Have fun and enjoy Runescape.
