 If you have one, use a pan with a heavy bottom.—This will give the fries the extra crisp that you’re after., Use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola oil or grapeseed.
 The oil should just be beginning to smoke when you add your leftover fries to the pan.
 Coating them will ensure that they get crisp without burning.
 This will keep them from sticking to the pan and burning.


Use a spatula to detach any fries that do become stuck to the pan.
 The length of time will depend on how thick your fries are cut. When the fries take on a crispy texture and golden brown color, they are done., Serve them up and enjoy!
