make sure that your refrigerator has a few inches of space behind it so air can circulate around the condenser coils.

 The appliance that uses the most energy is the refrigerator.;
, Clean them with a vacuum, duster, or a cleaner every three months to ensure it is running efficiently. If you have pets clean it every month. You can find vacuum attachments, dusters, and cleaner at AP Wagner's website.
 Having it too cold can be a waste of energy. It is recommended that the temperature for the refrigerator is 37 to 40 °F (3 to 4 °C), and that the freezer is 0 to 5 °F (−18 to −15 °C).
 A fuller fridge ensures the temperature is evenly distributed. If you have a lot of room in your refrigerator, fill some containers with water, and fill in the space. If that doesn't work, consider a smaller fridge.
 The gasket's job is to keep the cold air in and the warm air out. If it is not working properly the refrigerator will work harder keeping the air cold, and thus lead to a larger energy bill.
 Most of the energy used for machine-washing clothes goes to heating the water.
 A clogged lint screen makes the dryer use more energy. In addition to that it can also become a fire hazard.
 This will reduce warm-up and drying times.
 Doing this will circulate the air constantly, leading to a more evenly distributed temperature throughout the house.
 Make sure the power-flow is off before you do this.
