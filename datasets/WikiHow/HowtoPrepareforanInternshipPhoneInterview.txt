 Most likely it is the company, so make sure that the number and time is confirmed.;
, Go over as much related information to the topic as you can to boost your confidence and be prepared for questions pertaining to the company or industry. Pauses will not end the interview, but they will negatively effect the overall impression of your candidacy.
 Try to have follow-up questions in the case of yes or no answers so that you will gain more specific results from the person in question. Make sure to specify the parts you are interested in so that the caller will understand that your interest in the position is genuine.
 It helps you gain a better understanding of what will be expected of you, and it will show your interviewer that you are interested in the company, and not just showing off.
 No matter what time the interview is make sure you have gotten a good amount of rest and have had some nourishment before the interview. People can’t see you over the phone, but yawning and heavy breathing are easy to identify. You have to sound your best because people can’t see you.
