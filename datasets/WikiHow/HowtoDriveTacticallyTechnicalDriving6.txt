@summary
the pit maneuver is a procedure which has been used by law enforcement departments around the world (this is also known by some as the precision immobilization technique).

@summary
before the pit maneuver is performed, it is assumed that car a is approaching car b from behind.

@summary
car a attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of car b.

@summary
at speeds greater than 70 mph (110 km/h), car b requires not much more than a good strong kiss from car a.

@summary
if car a gives the initial tap with enough force, car b's back-end should slide out.

@summary
be prepared for car b to try to drive off as soon as they have slowed enough to regain control.

 Vehicles at high speed are, by laws in physics and aerodynamics, inherently less stable than at lower speeds. The rear of the vehicle is also fundamentally less stable than the front of the vehicle (especially a RWD vehicle, under acceleration).
 The faster the speed (freeway speeds), the greater the advantage Car A has.
 It is usually performed while the two cars are almost touching each other. A starting distance which is too great can cause danger to Car A.
 At speeds closer to 40 mph (64 km/h), Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B.
 Car A will need to straighten out, as to not follow through too much and lose control. Car A then needs to slow down immediately to avoid broadsiding Car B. For two comparable cars, Car A should always be able to slow down faster than Car B.
 An experienced driver in a FWD vehicle could recover and drive off in the original direction at surprisingly fast speeds. An experienced driver in a RWD vehicle will, once the vehicle is slowed most of the way, likely try to accelerate in the opposite direction of the initial pursuit. AWD vehicles may be able to go either direction.

This is a very difficult and dangerous maneuver, and should only be performed if you have been trained in the technique.
