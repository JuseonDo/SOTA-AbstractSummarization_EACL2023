 This reservoir is located on the driver’s side toward the rear of the engine compartment. If fluid is low, then you may have a leak.;
, The location of the brake fluid will also help you to locate the general placement of the leak.
, Make sure that your car is NOT turned on for this process. Turning on the car would cause the brake fluid to squirt out very quickly and would make the leak hard to control, depending on its severity.
 If the leak is coming from within a wheel, then you may have to remove the wheel to check for leaks in the lines and calipers.
