@article
 This could be thin nylon rope or jute of some kind. You will need about two and a half to three feet depending on the length of your arm. Cut this in half but leave one end a couple of inches longer than the other.;
, The pouch is the main part of the sling. It holds the ammo. The best material I have found is leather, but canvas or heavy cloth would work. It has to be very strong, else the cords will tear through it.
,,, Again, the bowline knot works very well. This is the retention cord.
 This is the release cord.
 You need to pinch it, not grip it .Pinch using the end of your thumb and the side of your index finger, first joint from the knuckle.
 It should be about the size of a golf ball or egg.
 One of the simplest is called the Apache Throw. Face 60 degrees away from your target, your arm extended behind your back, with your weight on your back foot. Swing forward, bringing your arm forward like a line drive. As you do this, shift your weight to your front foot and swing the rest of your body forward. Your arm guides the throw, but it is your body that propels the stone to lethal velocity. To release the stone, simply let go of the release cord.
