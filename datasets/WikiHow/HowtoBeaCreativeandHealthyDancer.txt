pick your classes well: make sure the place you take classes at or the company you are in is a place where you really can be yourself and connect with the teachers and other students.

@summary
do warm up before start: before starting on with the dance, it pays off to stretch or warm up as it loosens the stiffness in the body.

@summary
drink water.

@summary
time your travel: get to the studio a few minutes early.

@summary
concentrate: when class begins, clear your mind of everything, except what you are making your body do.

@summary
let yourself free: to be creative in your dancing, find your own style.

@summary
understand the steps: when you are doing a move, think of something else that it reminds you of.

@summary
maintain your posture: you must hold your chin up, your belly in and a smile on your face as you dance.

, Begin preparing an hour or at least 10mins in advance.


Run for 10 minutes, and then stretch your muscles all over your body for 15 minutes. Do yoga stretches and the stretches you do in dance class, switch it up a little.
 Eat a good meal about an hour before class, preferably something healthy. You will feel that pizza in your stomach when you dance.
 See if the room is open for you to go in. If it is practice dance or combinations, you are learning to refresh them in your mind.
 If you do a leap, give it all you got. If you do a tendu, keep your legs tight and your knee turned out. In everything you do, do it to the very very best of your ability.
 If you like ballet, try a little jazz or hip hop, or vice versa. Then, still having form, come up with your own little ways of doing moves. Explore your mind.
 If you were in a theatrical play, think of something you could pretend to be doing while doing that move. For example, when you arabesque, act as if you were young again and leaping into the air to grab lightning bugs. You get the idea... Just be yourself, and let only yourself be expressed when you dance!

, Dance is as much for others as it is for the performer.
