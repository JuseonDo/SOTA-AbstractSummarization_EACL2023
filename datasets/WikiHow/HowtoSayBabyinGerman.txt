 Here are a few examples.


Baby = Baby. Pronounced beh bee. (Not like English baby!)
Child / Kid = Kind. This is pronounced kint

Boy = Junge. It should sound like yoonge; the ng is like the sound at the end of the English words king or ring. The e at the end is voiced.
Girl = MÃ¤dchen. This sounds like maytchin. The first syllable is stressed.;
, If you go to Google Translate, there is a handy tool with a voice clip showing pronunciation although it's best if you hear somebody actually saying it.
