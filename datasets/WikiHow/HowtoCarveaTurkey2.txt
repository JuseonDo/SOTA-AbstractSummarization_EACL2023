@article
 This will enable you to see the actual turkey meat, so that you can remove the wishbone.
 Once you've found it, cut around the V-shaped wishbone as close as possible

, Try to avoid damaging the meat or breaking the wishbone.
 Two people hold the wishbone, one holding each end, and make a silent wish. They then pull the bone apart and whoever gets the longer piece will have their wish come true.


In some traditions, the person who gets the shorter piece will be the first to marry.
