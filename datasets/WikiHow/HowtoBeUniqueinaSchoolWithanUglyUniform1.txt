@article
 If your uniform is an unfavorable shade to you, chose a different shade of the same color. It will make you look like you are comfortable in your uniform, instead of trying to hide it.;
, If you wear a long blouse or shirt, don't buy a short coat or jacket that doesn't cover it.
 Branded clothes may shout that you have a particular clique that you may not want to be with. Or if you really can't resist branded ones, add touch of unique by adding a pin or a ribbon.
