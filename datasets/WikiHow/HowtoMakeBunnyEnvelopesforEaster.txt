 The color of envelope you use will determine the color of your bunny.;
, Press it shut.
 This means it should be taller than it is wide with the flap to the back.
 You will want to use about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of the envelope for your ears and leave 2 inches (5 cm) for the face. You can either draw the ears on freehand or you can download a template and stencil them on.


Go to http://images.marthastewart.com/images/content/web/pdfs/2004/kids_spr04_bunny_ear_template.pdf to find a template of bunny ears. You will place the template above the bottom 2 inches (5 cm) of your envelope and draw the bunny ears upwards.
 You will need to cut through both layers of the envelope to form bunny ears on both sides. Discard the extra paper between and to the sides of the ears.
 The side without the seal will be the front of your envelope. What was once the side will now be the bottom of your envelope and the bunny's face.
 Use white construction paper if you have a pink envelope. Take your template and draw a bunny ear on the construction paper.
 Take about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) off the outline of the ears. These will be the inside of your bunny ears.
, An upside down "V' is a good way to draw the mouth.
 Glue it to the point of your upside down "V."

, Glue the eyes above and to either side of the pom pom nose. Allow the glue to dry completely before using.
 Fill it with candy eggs or jelly beans.
