 They're still the same person that you were before; you just know one new piece of information about them. Keep hanging out and doing the same things that you normally do.
 Don't tense up and be awkward, they're just trying to be funny and be open about their sexuality.
 They need someone to talk to about these issues. Don't turn them away because you're uncomfortable.


Even if you can't understand, listening and validating their feelings can be a tremendous help.
If you feel that a problem is too big for you to help, say so. Express that you want them to feel better, and help them find someone who can help them more than you can.
 For LGBT+ people, finding a partner is an even bigger victory, because they are accepting who they are. Help them feel supported and loved.
