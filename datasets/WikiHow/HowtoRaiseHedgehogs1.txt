 While this guide will give you a detailed summary of what you need to know, this is by no means the only guide you should look at.;
, It is often better to get a hedgehog that is around six to eight weeks old, especially if you have children in the house. Younger hedgehogs will be able to get used to being handled better than some older ones. Make sure the breeder handles the baby hedgehogs from a young age.
 Look for healthy looking skin and quills, and a generally healthy look about it. If possible, get a veterinarian’s opinion before bringing the hedgehog home.
 Hedgehogs are fine living alone, and may get into fights if they are kept in the same place.
, Do not use cedar shavings, as these can cause respiratory problems. Also do not use pine shavings as they can cause skin irritations. Care fresh and aspen shavings are good to use. Lay about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of bedding at the bottom of the cage.
 This takes time, but it can be done.
