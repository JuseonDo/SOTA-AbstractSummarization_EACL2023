 Pre-wash you fabric. Washing your fabric is important, since it can shrink.;
, Be careful, needles are sharp. Use a thimble to prevent hurting yourself.
 Draw a straight line onto your fabric. Use special sewing chalk or washable pens that are easily removable.


Use something straight - a book, cardboard, boxes or a simple ruler - to draw a line that is truly straight. This line will be your guide through the sewing process.
, Go through the loop of the last stitch to secure it. Make another stitch and go through this loop one more time. Pull tight and weave in the loose ends.
