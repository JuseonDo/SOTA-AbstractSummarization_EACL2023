 The more water you use, the softer and creamier oats you will get.
 Set the heat on the stove to "high," and wait for the water to begin boiling.
 You will need ¼ cup (20 grams) of steel-cut oats per serving. You may also add a pinch of salt for flavor. Let the oats come back to a boil. Be sure to watch the pot so that the oats do not boil over onto the stove.


Steel-cut oats have a grittier texture and nuttier flavor compared to other types of oatmeal.
 If you cannot tell whether or not the oats are simmering, watch for steam and the occasional bubble.
 The longer you cook the oats, the softer they will become. When stirring the oats, be sure to scrap the bottom of the pot; this will prevent the oats from sticking to the pot.


If you wish to flavor your oatmeal, you may add some salt or butter. Other flavorings, such as honey, berries, and nuts are best left for the end. This is due to the long cooking time.
 Scoop the oatmeal into a deep bowl. At this time, you can add extra toppings to your oatmeal, such as honey, fruit, cinnamon, or maple syrup. For more ideas on toppings, click here. If you have any oatmeal left over, you may keep it in the fridge for up to a week.
