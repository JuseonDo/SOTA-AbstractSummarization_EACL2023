 A gentle horse is best, but make sure that your horse is in good shape to gallop. If you don't know how to tell if your horse is ready, ask your local vet.;

If your horse is not listening to you at each pace, stop your horse, and realize that you should not do a gallop this time, it's too dangerous.
, Your body should be slightly leaned forward, just enough so that the wind does not hold you back.
,, Many say that they enjoy it more than any other pace. At first it may be a little frightening, but after awhile you'll get the hang of it!

, Do not expect a horse to go straight from a gallop to a walk, go down through each pace, from the gallop, to the canter/lope, to the trot, to the walk.
 A gallop is a lot of work for horses, and though they like it, and will probably want to keep that pace, it is not good for them to gallop too much. To check for how 'hot' your horse is, stop your horse, dismount, and feel it's chest. It should be warm, but not hot. If it's still hot, then you need to cool your horse down more.
