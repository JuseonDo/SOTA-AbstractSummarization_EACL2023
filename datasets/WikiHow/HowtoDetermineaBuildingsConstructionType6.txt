classification:

@summary
modified fire resistive construction is iso class 5.

@summary
building elements:

@summary
modified fire resistive buildings are buildings where the exterior bearing walls and load-bearing portions of exterior walls must be of noncombustible materials or of masonry, but exterior nonbearing walls and wall panels may be slow-burning, combustible, or with no fire- resistance rating.

@summary
variations:

@summary
structural steel protection: note that modified fire-resistive buildings also include structural steel protection techniques — fire-protection material applied to steel.

@summary
advantages:

@summary
uses noncombustible materials

@summary
allows greater height and area than other construction classes

@summary
uses load-bearing members or assemblies that resist damage from fire

@summary
,

@summary
disadvantages:

@summary
expensive to construct and repair

@summary
provides a false sense of security

@article
 ISO Class 5 encompasses IBC Type IB.



Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs of masonry materials described in the definition of fire resistive (Construction Class 6) — less thick than required for fire-resistive structures but not less than four inches thick, or
Fire-resistive materials with a fire-resistance rating less than two hours but not less than one hour

, Materials include:

concrete
plaster
clay tile
brick or other masonry units
gypsum block
gypsum wallboard
mastic coatings
mineral and fiberboard
mineral wool



Ceilings protecting steel beams or joists: What happens when there is no fire-protection material applied to steel beams or joists that support floors or roofs? ISO still considers a building modified fire resistive if it has a suitable ceiling. Ceilings can be plaster or gypsum wallboard or suspended mineral tile. The entire floor-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting a floor) or roof-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting roof supports) should conform to construction details in a UL-listed or Factory Mutual (FM)-approved design. ISO individually evaluates each approved design.
