,, What you need to focus on understanding solidly are the main concepts. Besides, once you are proficient in a particular programming language, learning other programming languages may be a faster and easier process for you.
 Try something like Java or C Sharp.
 Always tell to yourself, "I'm NOT ALONE, Someone in this world should have faced the same error before". And GOOGLE the exact error message. Chances are 99% you will find the answer.
 Ask and answer questions.
 Use at least Notepad++.
 If this is an application. Then it's technically possible for you to build a similar one.
 Always ask yourself, can you build a similar application yourself. If not try to find the place where you think you might get stuck. And try to Google and find how to do it.
, Help others and ask from others. Different people will have different aspects to solve an issue.
 Usually most of the bugs can be corrected in a single line of code. What matters is, how hard you tried in different aspects to solve the issue.
