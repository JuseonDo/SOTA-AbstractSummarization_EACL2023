 This shape can vary. You could make it fluffy-looking by adding ear tufts, or maybe adding a swirly spiral of hair,etc.;
, These are in a sort of anime style, as they are much easier then drawing actual cat eyes. They also make the cat look much more cute.
 Be creative! Maybe add little fangs to the mouth, or a fishtail? Or how about squiggly whiskers if you were drawing a tough cat?

, Once again, creativity is the key. Especially the collar. A tough kitty could have skulls and fish bones. A sweet kitty could have flowers and hearts. Finally, a fancy kitty could have lots and lots of diamonds!

, You could make the tail scruffy to give it an "alley cat" look or fluffy, as if it were a "fancy kitty".
 Spots, stripes, etc.
 But you don't have to be. Draw a garden in the background or a simple food bowl, or whatever you can think of.
