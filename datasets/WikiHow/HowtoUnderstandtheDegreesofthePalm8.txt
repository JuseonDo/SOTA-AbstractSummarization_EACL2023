@summary
find the size of the second phalange of the thumb to determine the degree of tact.
@article



If this phalange bows inwards on both sides, creating a wasted appearance, the person will be naturally tactful and diplomatic.
If the second phalange is thick and oblong in appearance the person will be lacking in tact.
