 This step is very important. You don't want to put the peanut butter and jelly right in the container you are blending in, because if you do, you will be blending a lot to get the chunks out and in the process, blending out all of your ice cream. Leaving you with a completely smooth drink. It's not very good that way.;
,,,, You can even top it with chocolate and whipped cream and a cherry.
