 The preferred fighting stance differs between different disciplines, but the general rule is that your dominant leg is behind your other leg - the dominant leg's toe pointed to its side. Your secondary leg is in front, its toe pointed straight forward. Your torso is generally facing the direction of your dominant leg (righties' bodies will face right & vice versa). Your hands can be in a guard position or relaxed. For a kick, your hands are (obviously) less important.;
, If you want a more powerful front kick, use your back leg (primary)

, This is called chambering. Breathe in as you do this.
 With a front kick you can use the ball of your foot or your instep as a striking surface. As you kick, rapidly release the air in your lungs. Doing so will ensure that if you are doing kicking drills, you don't forget to breathe (which is easier to forget than it sounds!). Remember, breath in when you contract, breath out when you expand. This also will relax your body, allowing for proper technique, because holding air in means your muscles are too tense, and you are trying to control your kick too much, which weakens the kick, slows it down and will tire you out faster.
, If you used your secondary leg for the kick, it will go back where it started. If you used your back leg, place it down as if it were your secondary leg (switching sides on your stance)

, Many disciplines have techniques where you do multiple kicks with one foot, and it never returns to the ground.
