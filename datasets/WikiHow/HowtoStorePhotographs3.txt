make sure that the matting of the frame is acid-free (it should be labeled as such), if you choose to keep your pictures in a frame.

display picture frames in a room where the temperature and humidity doesn’t fluctuate a lot.

 Any type of glue or adhesive will contain chemicals that can damage a photo, so don’t tape or glue it inside the frame. A properly made frame will “sit” your photo on the matting without any adhesives.
 Never let sunshine hit your photo directly, even when your frame uses filtered glass.
 When hanging on a wall, try to avoid the outer walls of your house. The outer walls are subject to more temperature variation. Avoid placing frames near air ducts, vents or radiators. Photos placed near the kitchen can be damaged by smoke and odors.
