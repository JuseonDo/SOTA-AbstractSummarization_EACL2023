 After you have made the hole, place a door in it.;
,, You should be able to go through the painting now.
,, Don't actually label it "secret room", because if anyone does find your 'secret room', then they'll be a lot more likely to go into it. It's better to make it look uninteresting and maybe add an extra trap as a precaution.
 You might like to hide this chest under the floor, meaning you'll need to dig up the block it's under to use it, but Minecraft trolls won't know where it is. Some servers also have 'claim areas' meaning that if you hide your chest under the floor, the trolls won't be allowed to dig up the floor to get your chest!
