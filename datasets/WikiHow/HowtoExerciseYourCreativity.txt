 Imagine walking on the walls or the ceiling.;
, Close your eyes and pick a random color. Open your eyes to try to find anything with that color.
 (EX. Blue sky can be green or grass could be purple)

, Well list a few of your favorite names and mix-&-match. (ex. Katherine and Madeleine = Katheline)

,, Now try to place yourself in the animal's life. What would it do? Eat? Where and how would it sleep?

, Now imagine your hand, then try a simple object. Keep going until you can imagine a place like a beach or a large tree on a hill. (don't forget to use your senses)

, What you get is you pole vault with your fishing rod into the water.
 (Don't use marker...you might mark yourself)
