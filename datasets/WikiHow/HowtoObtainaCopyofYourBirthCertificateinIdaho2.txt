Find the link for the "Certificate Request Form" and print it out.Contact the bureau at 208-334-5988 for alternative means of acquiring this form (or providing information in an alternate manner) if necessary.
 The same form is used to request records of birth, stillbirth, death, marriage, and divorce, so make sure you check the "Birth" box and fill out the correct information boxes.


The requested information includes: full name, date of birth, city of birth, and full names for both parents.



Alternatively, you can submit two forms of ID from a list that includes a Social Security card, vehicle registration, student ID, traffic ticket, pay stub, auto insurance card, and hunting license, among others. One of the two valid forms must be signed.
A notarized (stamped/sealed) signature on the Certificate Request Form will also suffice, as will a court order.
Lastly, you could have an immediate family member with a valid photo ID request the copy for you.
 The cost is $13 (plus $5 for rush shipping) and can be made by check or money order. Make payments to "Idaho Vital Records."


Send your request to: Idaho Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics, P.O. Box 83720, Boise, ID 83720-0036.
