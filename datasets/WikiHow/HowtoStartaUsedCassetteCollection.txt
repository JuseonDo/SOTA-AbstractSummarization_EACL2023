 Having a record that you always go to not only helps you create lasting relationships with those who share your musical interests, but it also gives you a place close to find cassettes.;
, This will prove useful later in the process when you get to categorizing and organizing your tapes.
 You may want to sort them by artist, title, or genre. Sorting them by artist usually works best.
 These can be any sort of blank, light-colored label that you can apply to the spine of the cassette case. Don't get glossy or "shiny" labels because they'll peel (and you can't write on them).
 When you're done, you'll want to write the year, title and artist on the spine, such as "Elton John- Madman Across the Water- 1971".
 Make sure they're in a cool, dry, and accessible place.
 Make sure to use the simplest version of the method you choose; making it complicated may seem fun and enhancing when you start, but it will be a pain later.
 Even if you only have one tape, it's always helpful to have a method of organization before adding more.
