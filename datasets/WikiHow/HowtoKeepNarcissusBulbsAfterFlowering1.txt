 It’s very important not to cut back the daffodil foliage after flowering.


This is because the plant uses its leaves to make energy from the sunlight, which it needs in order to survive the winter and flower again in the spring.
Foliage should not be cut for at least two or three months after flowering.;
, Instead of cutting back the foliage immediately after flowering, wait until it withers and dies away by itself. Then, once the withered foliage is brown and shriveled, you can remove it by pulling or cutting.
 It is important to feed the bulbs at this time of year specifically, as this is when the roots are most actively growing.
 It’s also a good idea to give your bulbs an annual top dressing of organic mulch.


Do this before the ground gets cold, ideally in the summer or fall.
Three to four inches of well-rotted manure or leaf mold will work well.
