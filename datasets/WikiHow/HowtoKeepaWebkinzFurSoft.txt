 The best type of Webkinz to do this to are the short, thick furred Webkinz. Other types won't work very well with this method.
 You will need a small spray bottle, olive oil for the fur, a small comb, and a hand rag., Fill the spray bottle with water and drop three to four drops of the olive oil into the water. Shake well., Spray 3-4 sprays over each section of the Webkinz. It's easier to spray in sections, such as the back first, then the stomach, then the arms and legs and face., Start by combing all over the Webkinz in a downward motion to get any knots or crumbs out., Take the comb again, but this time, comb in an upward motion to add volume., Take the hand rag and rub it all over the Webkinz in order to get any extra water out of the fur., After drying, you may want to comb and fluff the fur again, however, this is optional., Now you have a fresh, soft, plush Webkinz!
