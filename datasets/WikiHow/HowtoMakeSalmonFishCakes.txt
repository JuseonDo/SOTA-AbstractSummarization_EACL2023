, You will know this when you can slice through the lemon grass with ease. Chop roughly and add it to the blender and blend again for 1 minute. Toss in spring onions and coriander and mix well.
 Shape the salmon mixture into small balls and flatten them slightly. Add olive oil and slide in 3 cakes at a time; cook for 2-3 minutes each side. As there is little fat in the mixture and no bread to bind it, avoid moving the cakes around the pan until they are ready to turn or they will crumble.
