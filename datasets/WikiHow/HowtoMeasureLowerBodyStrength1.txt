@summary
stand with your back flat against a wall.

@summary
bend your knees and slide down the wall until you are in a squat position.

@summary
continue to slide into your squat until you are in a comfortable position without feeling any excess strain on the knee joint.

@summary
repeat the test two more times and use the highest reading achieved.

@summary
make a note of the length of time you were able to hold the squat position.
@article
 Keep your feet about a foot away from the wall and shoulder width apart.;
, Be sure to keep the small of your back pressed firmly against the wall with no arching. Pay careful attention to your knees to make sure they are aligned properly over your toes.
 Hold this position for a goal of one minute or until you can no longer maintain proper form.
 Allow yourself adequate rest periods between tests to avoid over-straining the legs and to allow them to recover.



If you held a squat with proper form for under 20 seconds, your legs are considered relatively weak.
Remaining in the squat position for 20 to 35 seconds means your leg strength is average.
If you held for 35 seconds or longer, your leg strength is strong.
