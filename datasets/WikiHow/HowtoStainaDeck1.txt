 The surface needs to be completely clear before you can stain it.

Check between the boards to make sure there are not small rocks, sticks or other items in the way.
 These areas will need to be sanded before the deck is stained to make them smooth and bring out a brighter shine.









Sand in the direction of the grain. Use a pole sander, which allows you to stand while you sand, or get on your knees and sand with a hand sander.
 Cleanser can be found at hardware stores, home improvement retailers or department stores.









Follow the directions on the deck cleaner you choose to use. Some will require you to wet the deck before washing it, others will want you to apply the product directly to the wood.
Allow the cleaner to soak into the deck according to the instructions. Rinse the deck after cleaning it if necessary.
 Usually this will take about 2 days.
