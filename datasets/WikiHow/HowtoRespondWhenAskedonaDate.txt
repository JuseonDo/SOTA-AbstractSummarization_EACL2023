 If you really like him, then go for it. Even if you get embarrassed easily, it's just one word.;
, This could just end up hurting him more - no one wants to go out with someone who doesn't like them.
 If you say maybe, then it could just be giving false hope if you end up deciding not to go out with him. You don't want to lead him on.
 Don't be harsh in your letdown; it probably took him weeks to get the courage to confront you.
 It's better to get rejected than to think you have a chance with someone when you don't.Â 

, It will just get boring and uncomfortable, and you giving him all the reasons why you don't want to go out with him won't help him.
