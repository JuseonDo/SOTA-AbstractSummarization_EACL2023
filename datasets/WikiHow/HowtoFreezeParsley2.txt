 You can use a salad spinner or a paper towel to dry it faster.
 Separating the leaves from the stems will make the parsley easier to make into ice cubes.
 Fill each segment of an ice cube tray with parsley., Use as little water as possible - just enough to cover the parsley so you can make ice cubes.
 Leave them there until the cubes are frozen. You can either leave the cubes in the trays until you're ready to use them or pop them out and put them in freezer bags.
 You can add the entire cube to a dish or let it thaw in a bowl and drain the water before using.
