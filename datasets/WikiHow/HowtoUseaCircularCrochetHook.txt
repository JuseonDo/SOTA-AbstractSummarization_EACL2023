@summary
decide how large your blanket will be and chain the appropriate amount, using yarn a.

@summary
insert the hook into the second chain from the hook.turn your project around so that you are now holding the opposite hook.

@summary
attach yarn b with the traditional slip knot.

@summary
with that same hook and yarn b, build the stitches back onto the hook.

@summary
let go of yarn b and turn your project so you are now working with the other hook.

@summary
yarn over and pull through two of the loops on the hook.

@summary
with each color you will remove all the loops, add all the loops, and then turn the project.

@summary
to finish, work the stitches off the hook, as in step 4, until you have only one loop remaining.
@article
 Keep in mind that, once you start to build on this chain, your stitches will all be on the circular hook at one time.
 Yarn over, pull through, and leave that loop on the hook. Repeat to the end of the chain. The tail of yarn A should be at your working hook. Let go of yarn A.,, Yarn over and pull through the first two loops on the hook (both will be color A). Yarn over again, pulling through the next two loops (the first is color B, the second color A). Repeat until all the loops are off of the hook., Insert the hook under a vertical bar, yarn over, pull through, and keep the loop on the hook. Repeat through to the very last vertical bar, remembering the last bar will be yarn B, not yarn A., Pick up yarn A and work as you did in step #4., Repeat to the end., Continue this until you've reached your desired length., Insert the hook under the first vertical bar, yarn over and, this time, pull through both loops on the hook. Do this the entire way across, then tie off the yarn and weave in your tail.
