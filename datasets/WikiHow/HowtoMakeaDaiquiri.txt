 Some people like to fill it with ice and soda water. The soda water removes any oils and dirt that may be lingering on your glass. It also helps the ice chill the glass faster. Move your Martini glass to the side for the time being. It will be sufficiently chilled by the time you are ready to use it.;
, Depending on the style of shaker you have, you can cover it with either the cover that came with it or just use a 16 oz glass to cover it.
 Shake either 10 times or until water condensates on the outside of the shaker. Rum doesn't bruise the way gin does, so don't worry about shaking it too much. However, you don't want to melt all the ice into the drink, so 10 times should be enough.
, Many people prefer a Julep strainer because it's less complicated than a Hawthorn strainer. Both have their merits!
