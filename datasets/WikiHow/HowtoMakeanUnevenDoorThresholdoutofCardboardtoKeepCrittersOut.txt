@summary
examine the weaknesses of door sweeps and ready made thresholds.

@summary
to make your own door threshold, that fits like a glove, out of cardboard, you have to assemble some materials: cardboard, box cutter, paper glue, measuring tape, and duct tape (buy a color that matches your floor).

@summary
,

@summary
measure the width of your doorway and the thickness of your door.

@summary
plan on making your threshold a few inches wider than you doorway, so if your doorway is 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide make it 33 inches (83.8 cm).

@summary
cut the strips of cardboard.

@summary
stack and lightly glue the strips of cardboard together and let it dry awhile.

@summary
,

@summary
do an initial fitting of the threshold to the base of the doorway.

@summary
when satisfied with the fit, turn the threshold over and duct tape the threshold to the floor and exactly under the door.

Door sweeps work fairly well but tiny mice can squeeze in at the ends of the door sweep. Strengthen the ends of your door sweep by putting an additional wood screw at the end. Additionally, strengthen the door sweep by using rubber cement, or even paper glue, to bond the lower part, usually made of rubber or felt, to the metal upper part. If possible, mount the door sweep at the exterior of the door, because if it is mounted on the interior, a space is created under the door that a big roach will naturally hide under. Sometimes a door sweep may fit better mounted on the interior side of the door and that hiding space is created. If you live in an older home and the flooring is uneven, the door sweep might get pinched between the door and the floor, and break.






Door thresholds decreases the gaps under doors, but not perfectly, and they work well with a door sweep. Door threshold also keeps dust from blowing into a room, and helps contains the heat in winter, and the cool air in summer.

,, Next measure the space under your door.
 With a door that is 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) thick, plan on making your threshold 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) wide.
 For an uneven threshold make their widths the same and the lengths different. For an even threshold make the widths and lengths the same, and all you have to do is make the height correct. In either case you want a snug fit.
, If there is still a gap, add another strip of cardboard. If the threshold is too high, either compress the threshold a bit or peel off a layer of cardboard. Adjust the length of the threshold to fit the doorway exactly.
