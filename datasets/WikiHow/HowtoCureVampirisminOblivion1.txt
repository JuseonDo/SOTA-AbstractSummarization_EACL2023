 He will refer your character to Count Hassildor of Skingrad.
 Once Hassildor comes, he explains that he and his wife are vampires. He lives with it, but his wife, Rona Hassildor, could not and slipped into a coma. Hassildor wants the cure, and tells of a witch that lives near the Corbolo river, south of Cheydinhal in Drakelowe.
 She will say that she requires five empty grand soul gems before she will help with the cure. Once these are delivered, she asks for a number of ingredients to make the cure. Most can be purchased, but it is not easy to buy items when in the advanced stages of vampirism.
