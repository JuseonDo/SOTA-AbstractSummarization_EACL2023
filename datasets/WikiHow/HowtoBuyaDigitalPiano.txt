 (ex: Richmond piano store) Before buying a digital piano it is important to try it out in person.;
, Normally the sales people are quite helpful. If they don't carry digital pianos, they will know a piano store that does.
 They should be the length of a dollar bill minus one of the white margins. This is the standardized size of a grand piano key.
 The standard depression for acoustic pianos is 7/8ths of an inch.
 Is it from speakers behind the digital piano or only from the area of the keys you are playing? Higher quality digital pianos will have speakers behind each key from which the sound will come. You can easily check by playing a chromatic scale for several octaves.
 Polyphony is basically the memory the piano has and how many notes the digital piano will play at once. If you are playing sustained arpeggios you don't want your earlier notes to fade out prematurely.
 Some may sound quite electric while others mimic the sound of a grand piano. Don't be afraid to ask the sales person what acoustic piano was recorded for the sound of the digital piano.
 Purchase the digital piano that best fits your price range and has the most realistic features.
