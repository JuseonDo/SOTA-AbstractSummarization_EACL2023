@summary
begin by asking a member of your audience for a coin.

@summary
hold the coin out to your audience between your thumb and first two fingers of your left hand.

,

@summary
pretend to pass the coin from your left to your right hand by doing the following:

@summary
turn your left hand so that your thumb is on top with your fingers below.

@summary
direct your gaze to your right hand (the one you wish the audience to believe holds the coin), and raise it up to your audience.

@summary
wiggle the fingers of your right hand and open it up, to reveal it the hand to be empty.

@article
 If no one has one, produce one of your own.


Any small object can be used in place of the coin but it must be no larger than the size of the coin and something that is easily concealed and held onto.;
,,






Reach toward the coin with your right hand so that your thumb is going behind the coin and your fingers are going in front of it. The fingers of your right hand will obscure the coin from the audience's view.







Relax the thumb of your left hand, allowing the coin to drop to your fingers.






Continue the grasping motion with your right hand, but do not actually grab the coin. If you have done this correctly, the audience will now believe the coin to be in your right hand.
 At the same time, swing your left hand in a relaxed motion to a normal position by your side. At this point, it's best to drop the object into your pocket so that your left hand can remain free to move around or reveal that it, too, is empty.


To help encourage the audience to watch your right hand, patter a little about the need to watch that hand closely.
