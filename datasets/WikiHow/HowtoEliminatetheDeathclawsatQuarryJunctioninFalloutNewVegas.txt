 Stimpacks, Doctor's Bags, Med-X, and and as much food as you can carry. If you haven't even passed Quarry Junction yet, listen to the advice the workers give you: go around and start stocking up on supplies once you reach New Vegas.;
, You'll want something heavy, like power armor. Make sure it's fully repaired. Try to include a helmet, if you have one.
 Good choices would be the Alien Blaster, the Gobi Campaign sniper rifle, Gauss rifles, heavy incinerators, etc.
 Good choices are Boone, Veronica, Rex, and Lily.
 Save before you enter.
 Pilfer the dead Powder Ganger if you feel like it.
 Stay up on the ridge. As you get close, crouch until you are hidden, then start firing.
 Avert all your fire to the den mother. This is the most powerful Deathclaw, and you need to kill it as soon as you see it.
 Get out of there! If you have companions, they will hopefully distract any remaining Deathclaws long enough for you to escape.
 The Deathclaws will no longer respawn once killed.
