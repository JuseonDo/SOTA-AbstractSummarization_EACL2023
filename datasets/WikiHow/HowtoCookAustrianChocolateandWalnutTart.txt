 Since tart dough must be cold, like the ingredients, keep your warm hands out of the mixture.;
, Add butter, cut into cubes.
 Do not mix a lot, just enough to heat the butter. Beat the egg with a little salt and add it to the flour mixture.
 The resulting dough should be refrigerated in a Saran wrap, for at least one hour.
 Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Line a pie form/pan with parchment or similar baking paper. Shape the dough into the pan/form, pressing down lightly and quickly.
 Pre-bake the dough for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, take it out and grease it with a beaten egg white. Set aside in readiness for adding the filling shortly.
 Place the shavings into a deep bowl.
 Stir continuously until the first boil.
 Stir gently using a wooden spoon, being careful not to make foam or bubbles.


Do not use an electric mixer, as it will create foam.
 Fold them into the chocolate cream mix. Mix until you obtain a liquid composition that is slightly creamy.
 Pour the chocolate cream mixture over the top.
 Bake for 10 minutes at 180ºC/350ºF. Turn of the fire or the heat and leave the tart to bake in the remaining warmth of the oven for another 10 minutes.
 Let it cool, then put it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.
