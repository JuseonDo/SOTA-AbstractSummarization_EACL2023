 Natural air fresheners carry more than scent; they are also lovely to work with and will help you to feel as though you are in a garden plucking fresh free-of-thorns roses when sprayed.;
, A ceramic or glass bowl would be ideal.
 For example, roses, freesias, violets or lavender. Wash the flowers if needed, or spray them with a little water to gently moisten.
 Let sit in this water to rest and infuse overnight.
 Transfer the flowers to it and cover with water. Let it settle by chilling in the fridge.
 Label so that you remember what's in it.


If wished, you can add additional scent such as mint leaves, essential oil drops, or scented vinegar, etc.
