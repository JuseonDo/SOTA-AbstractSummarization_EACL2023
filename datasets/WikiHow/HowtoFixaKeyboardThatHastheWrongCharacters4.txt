 If you have multiple keyboards installed that you want to switch between, there are a couple of ways that you can do it:


Click the input language button in your Language Bar. This can be found next to the System Tray. If you don't see it, right-click the taskbar and select "Toolbars" → "Language bar."
Press ⊞ Win+Space to cycle between your installed languages.
 This will launch the Control Panel. You can use the Control Panel to remove keyboards you don't use or install ones that you need.
 This will open a new window.
 This will open your keyboard options.
 This will open a list of your installed keyboards in a new window.
 This will be the language that your keyboard uses to type.
 If your preferred input language isn't listed, clicking the "Add button" will allow you to browse through all of the available input languages.


When you've found the language you want to add, expand it in the tree and check the specific keyboards you want to install.
 Removing keyboards you have no use for can help prevent you from accidentally selecting them:


Select the keyboard you don't use from the list of installed keyboards.
Click the "Remove" button to remove it.
