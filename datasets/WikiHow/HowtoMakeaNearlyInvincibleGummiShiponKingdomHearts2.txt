This ship is going to be round-ish and will literally be only 1 gummi thick;
, at the top .'s is material-gs = is 2 light tubes.

.:=::=:.

 ::




':=::=:'


in the middle of the material-g-squares place a graviga  on east and west group of 4 and the blizzagas on the north and south group of 4.
The gummi ship is now complete... now on to abilities

,, the ship is finished! go try it out at your favorite gummi route or beat routes you've never finished.


The Teeny ships are simple to make they a a block of 4 material-g's with a blizzara on top and 2 fires below those.. these Teeny ships don't have to be used but they were suggested along with the gummi ship..
