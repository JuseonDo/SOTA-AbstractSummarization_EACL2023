 Peel the strings from the celery.;
, All you need to do is soften them just enough so that a paring knife can just pass through a medium sized vegetable with resistance, but you don't want it hard. Anything approaching soft is overdone.
 Cut a small "X" in the point end of the tomato, opposite the stem end. Blanche the tomatoes in rapidly boiling water for 5 seconds. Immerse the tomatoes in ice water for 15 to 30 seconds. The skin should peel right off. Slice them across and scoop the seed pulp out.
 Cut the stems and spines out.
 Blend on high until the vegetables are pureed.
 Strain and chill.
