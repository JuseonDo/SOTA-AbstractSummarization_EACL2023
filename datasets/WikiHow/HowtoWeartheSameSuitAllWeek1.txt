A crisp white shirt always looks good.
A light blue shirt is another common option.;

Break out of the usual mold with a shirt in a fun color, like pink.
Try a black shirt to add a little edge to your look.



Wear stripes in any color for a professional but fun look.
Novelty prints can come off as unprofessional in a work environment, so leave those for home.
 Vintage tees are a great item to add to a suit to bring out your individuality and personal style.
 A thin turtleneck made of a silk or cashmere blend will add style while allowing you to remain conservative at work.
