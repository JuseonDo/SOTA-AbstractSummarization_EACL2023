 Each piece needs to be 6 inched (15.24 centimeters) long.
 Flip over one of the pieces of tape, and press it down onto the other piece. Make sure that all edges are aligned. You should end up with a 6 inch (15.24 centimeter) long piece of duct tape that is smooth on both sides.
 Bring the two long edges together, and press the piece of tape flat. If you want, you can run your fingernail down the fold to make a sharper crease.
 Take the two long edges, and bring them back down towards the center fold.









Use a clothespin or paperclip to help the accordion hold its shape while you do the next step.
 You will be using it to wrap around the center of your bow.
 If you placed a clothespin or paperclip around your accordion, take it off before wrapping the tape around the center.
 You may have noticed that your bow has two folds and a groove on one side, and one fold and two grooves on the other. Flip the bow over that that the side with the two folds and one groove is facing you. Pry open a bobby pin and slide the prong under the central piece of tape. The groove will help conceal the bobby pin.
