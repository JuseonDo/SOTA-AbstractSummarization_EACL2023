 Put the eggs in a pot and fill the pot up with water. Set the stove on high. Boil for 10 to 15 minutes.;
, As the eggs are boiling, grab your favorite bacon. Microwave or cook anyway you like––just make sure bacon is crispy.
, Grab any chips you like (barbecue flavored chips are recommended). Crush the chips with your hand or fingers inside of a big bowl until the chips are turned into large crumbs. They should be just big enough that there is still a crunch to them, not as small as breadcrumbs.
 Cut into very small pieces.
 Once the water has cooled, crack the eggs from the bottom and begin to peel over cold water, once all eggs are peeled dry them and place them to the side.
 Scoop out the yolks with a teaspoon and put them into the bowl. Lay the boiled egg white halves to one side, for filling shortly.
 Spoon in a spoonful of your favorite mayonnaise. Use the spoon to crush the yolks and mix everything together. Stir until all the ingredients are combined.
,,, Don't leave for too long or the crunch factor of both chips and bacon will be reduced.
