 Try to name her something you will enjoy.;
, (Energy is a good thing to have, but it's value will drop off over time. Most of the best Diablo 2 Sorcerers only used the base 35 Energy.)

, Fire, Ice, Lightning. Pouring all skill points into a single element is a risky investment, as a Fire sorc taking on fire immune creatures will result in you needing to hit it with melee. Try investing in one main element, with one other element as a backup.
