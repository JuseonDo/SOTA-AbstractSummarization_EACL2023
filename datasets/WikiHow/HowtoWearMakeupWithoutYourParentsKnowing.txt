 Go to the mall with a friend or just ride your bike to Target. It doesn't really matter, you just need to be without your parents, so they don't catch you or ask what you're buying.;
,, Chap sticks and balms are the most unnoticeable. If you are at the mall and do not want expensive stuff from Macy's, head to a Justice, Claire's or Icing.
 For mascara, clear is best. You could also try a color which matches the colour of your lashes.
, If you take the bus, learn how to do it on stoplights.
, You can either keep a bottle of makeup remover in your bag, disguised in a body mist/perfume bottle, or you can make your own makeup remover.


To make your own makeup remover, get your ingredients ready: no-tear baby shampoo, filtered water, coconut oil, paper towels, and a container with a lid you can close.
Put one cup of filtered water into a microwavable bowl with 2 tbsps of coconut oil and 2 squirts of shampoo. Microwave for 35 seconds and pour into the container.
Cut the paper towel squares to fit in the jar. Put the towels into the jar. Make sure they get covered by the makeup remover so that when you pull them out for use, they will be soaked and ready to go.
