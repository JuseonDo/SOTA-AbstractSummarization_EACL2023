 Start out walking for two minutes then change it up and run for two, you can go five for five or one for one. Repeat this for 30 minutes. You want to elevate and normalize your heart rate.;
, Do the first one with your knees on the ground(also called the Modified Push up) then on your next set raise your knees, then on your last set elevate your feet(if possible).
 We pack on the pounds because not only are we eating unhealthy foods, such as burgers and fries, but also our bodies are hardwired to store fat,since food was scarce in the ancient times.
 Then move onto military press + v-ups.
 They are the 3 most powerful bodybuilding exercises you can do.
 You may feel like doing these exercises are tough or even impossible, but that is because you have fat. As you keep exercising and shedding fat, doing these exercises will become as easy as counting to ten!
