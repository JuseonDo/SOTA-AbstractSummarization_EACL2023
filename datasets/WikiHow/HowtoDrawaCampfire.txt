 This forms the border in which you will place the campfire.
 These are the rocks that a camper would gather for keeping the fire from spreading., Like the spokes of a wheel, have the logs fanning out around the circle you drew in the previous step. Keep the logs apart from each other for the best effect.,, See How to draw flames for detailed help on drawing the flames. Have them coming up from the middle of the fire. Draw some lines inside the flames for added detail.,,,, This step is optional but makes the drawing come to life. Add reds, oranges and yellows for the flames. Use browns for the sticks/logs and soil. Use grays for the rocks.,
