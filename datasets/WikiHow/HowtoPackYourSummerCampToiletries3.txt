 For example, items such as paper hand wash, hand sanitizer, tissues and toilet paper can be packed in a plastic carrier for when you need it for hygiene.
 You're on camp, it's a time to learn to make do, enjoy the great outdoors and not be hung up on the standard requirements for beauty regimes. By all means take care of your body but don't be so hung up on maintaining your usual standards that you fail to enjoy the experience.
