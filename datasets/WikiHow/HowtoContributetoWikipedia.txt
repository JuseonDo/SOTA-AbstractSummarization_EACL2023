 For all of these privileges to take place, your account must be at least four days old and have at least ten edits.
 An article that is not complete, or written in full detail, may be marked with a {{Stub}} tag. You can help by adding content to the articles currently marked as stubs. Articles may also have a more detailed {{stub}} meaning that the stub has been sub-sorted. Sub-sorted stubs include anything from Arts, Cultures, Design, Broadcast Media, Radio, Television, Literature, and more!

, You can upload as many pictures as you wish; however, you must provide detailed information on the source and the license of the file. If you cannot provide that information, do not upload any photos. If you still choose to upload photos, they will be deleted.
 The English version of Wikipedia currently has over 5,168,000 articles! You can help continue this growth by writing an article of your own. You should write an article about something you are very knowledgeable about, so that you can write a complete and informative article. Articles created as test pages, pure vandalism, attack pages, etc. will be deleted on the spot, without any further debate.
 People who vandalize or spam a page may have added inappropriate links, blanked the page, added nonsense, etc. You can help out by removing, or reverting, this vandalism. Removing vandalism will make Wikipedia a better place for people to gather information and resources.
 You can help out newcomers to make it a bigger and better community for the encyclopedia.
, If you're getting good at it you'll get a tool called 'rollback' that lets you revert vandalism faster. Remember, spam is also vandalism! If somebody is persistent about vandalising a page, report them to the 'Administrator Intervention against Vandalism' board - AIV for short - once they have been warned suitably.
