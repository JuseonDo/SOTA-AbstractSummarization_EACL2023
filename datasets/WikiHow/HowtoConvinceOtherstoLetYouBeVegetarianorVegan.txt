 Politely explain your reasoning, but be persistent.;
, If it is against their religion or something else maybe you can meet halfway. Maybe you can be vegetarian once a week for a month and so on and so forth. If they see how it positively affects you, maybe they will ease up a bit and over time you can become one.
 If you are having meat for dinner, ask for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead. If they say no, ask again for a compromise where you can eat half or only a little of the meat everyone else is eating. Over time, as you eat less and less animals, people will see you are legit about this.
 Remind them there are many, many new foods to try to that you feel it will be a positive experience for you.
 No meat or they lose. You could also ask them to try vegetarian foods in place of meat.


Morningstar chicken and burgers
Boca chicken is a vegan choice
Light life smart bacon is another vegan choice

, You do not have to be annoying about this or they may approve less. State that this is a personal choice and you would like to be in control of your own life.
 You do not have to say it like this but something such as "I'm okay" when offered meat or an "I'm not digging this taste" will probably doing the trick. However, it depends on who the person is.
