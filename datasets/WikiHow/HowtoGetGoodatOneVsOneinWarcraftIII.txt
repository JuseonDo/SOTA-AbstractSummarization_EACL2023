@summary
play with your friends (if any of them plays war3), try to beat them and counter their strategies, if you beat them, they will probably come out with a new strategies, and then you can counter that strategies too, it's good practice, you can find anything out there (on battle-net =p).

you may find the pros rushing or people saying that rushing is good.

@summary
don't get a hero to level 2 and think you creeped enough, keep creeping all the time unless you're rushing or defending your base.

 Buy an original Warcraft CD and play on Battle-Net. And practice with your race. If you're good as human, play as human, if you like undead but really can't play it, and you're good as orc, then either you get good with undead or play Orc. Don't just play a little with one race and then try another one, and then go back to the race you were playing before. Maybe play a few games with each race and then you choose the one that's best for you and... PRACTICE.;
, Find out who is one of the best in your race (not meaning your friends, meaning the pros) and watch his or their replays, and try to take something out of it. Eg. if you're orc, watch Grubby's replays and find out what he does against what and how he does it, and do it yourself. After that, practice what you have learned.
,, If you are not a good rusher, don't rush, unless you really have the advantage, and if you have the advantage but can't rush because he has towers, creep and move around your opponent's base.
