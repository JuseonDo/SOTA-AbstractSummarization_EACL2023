 The stakes should be about 1 yard (91 cm) apart.
 You can use any star for this, although you’ll probably want to pick one of the brighter stars.
, Earth’s rotation from west to east causes the stars in the sky, as a whole, to rotate from east to west. Which way the star has moved with respect to its original position where you sighted it tells you which direction you’re facing.


If the star rose, you’re facing east.
If the star sank, you’re facing west.
If the star moved to the left, you’re facing north.
If the star moved to the right, you’re facing south.
