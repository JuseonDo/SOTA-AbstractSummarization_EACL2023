, This will reduce the damage from his physical attacks. His physical attack appears to have a draining effect, so be sure to do more damage than he can heal at all times.
,, This attack is very, very devastating. It does fractional damage based on your Maximum HP. You don't want to be caught off-guard by this attack. This is what Magical Masque is for. Since Damoceles Photon is a magic attack, Magical Masque will completely protect you from it. Make sure the Songstress is dancing at all times, since he can pull this attack out anytime he wishes. If you are hit and the Songstress is not dancing, heal up immediately.
 Darkness by a Dark Knight and a few of the Berserker's attacks work well on him.
 He has 146,200 HP (153,510 HP if oversouled) so it will take a while. Congratulations! You beat him!
