You may want to use a spatula or steel scraper, which will also help with removing excess liquid.



Use a sponge, water, and liquid dish-washing detergent or mild soap to clean the block on every side.

Use bleach or a mixture of white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.
Add 1 tbsp. (14.78 milliliters) of bleach to 1 gallon (3.78 liters) of water and use a sponge to clean all surfaces of the butcher block.
Rinse the butcher block with water to remove any remaining traces of disinfectant.
Spray your butcher block with undiluted white vinegar and allow the vinegar to completely soak into the surface.
Use a paper towel saturated with 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and gently swipe it across the butcher block to complete the disinfection process.

An excellent oil for cutting boards can be found at the drugstore labelled as a "lubricant laxative". It's odorless, tasteless, colorless, and will not turn rancid.
Pour mineral oil directly on your butcher block and gently use a sponge to spread the oil across the entire surface.
Let the mineral oil soak completely into the surface of your butcher block and use a soft rag to wipe away any remaining or excess oil that will not soak in.



This procedure will seal the oil into the wood and prevent additional bacteria from contaminating the wood.
Apply small amounts of beeswax to a soft rag and gently wipe it across your butcher block until each entire surface area is covered with beeswax.
Use gentle, circular motions to rub the beeswax into the wood and wipe away excess beeswax with a clean, dry cloth.



This will cause the entire surface to wear equally instead of in one specific spot when you cut.



Using cleavers with extremely sharp or razor edges may cause your butcher block to splinter or chip.
