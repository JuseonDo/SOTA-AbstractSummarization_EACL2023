 The best way to check your typing speed is to go through an internet website as these do all the hard work for you without you having to download any software.;
,, Hit "Search."


You will come across several different sites. Some favourites are www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed + www.testmytyping.com/typing-speed-test.
 When you are ready you press "start the clock" and when finished "stop."


Your typing speed will become calculated in words per minute format and any errors you made will usually become highlighted.
