 This will probably take a while. The only advice is try every door so you might find shortcuts.

Go to every place again and beat it again. This will give you trophies, music, Toon Link, Jigglypuff, and Wolf.

, It doesn't matter how good they are. You just need 15 stages, you will then unlock more stage parts!

, P1 plays as Donkey Kong, P2 plays as Kirby. Play 20 matches. You will get the Kirby melee stage; Green Greens and Donkey Kong stage; 75m, a cool DK stage based on the classic Donkey Kong.
 You'll unlock more as you go. Beat those too.
 This time, P1 is Captain Falcon and P2 is Luigi. Fight 10 times. You should get Luigi's Mansion and Big Blue Melee.
 You should get Pokémon Stadium Melee.
 Now you can actually have fun in Brawl!
