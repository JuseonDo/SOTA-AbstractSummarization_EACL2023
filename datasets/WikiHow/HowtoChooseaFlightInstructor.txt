@summary
airports usually have a fixed base operator (fbo).

@summary
if no one has recommended a cfi, the school will assign one to you.

@summary
some questions you might want to ask the cfi:

@summary
what is your schedule and general availability?,

@summary
after the first couple of flights you (and your cfi) will start to get a feel for how the training is going.

@summary
flight schools are authorized by the faa to operate under two sets of regulations known as far part 141, or part 61 (the fbo will tell you or ask) many schools can offer you a choice.

@summary
if you are are with a part 141 school you will normally fly with one cfi.

@summary
the training under part 61 is less structured in some ways, but can be more suitable for some students.
@article
 Larger general aviation airports may have several to choose from. The FBO usually hosts (or may own) a flight school. Flight schools have Certified Flight Instructors (CFI's) and training aircraft for rent.;
, (see introduction above)

,
What is your training philosophy?
What is your billing policy? What is your cancellation policy?

, Ask yourself if you feel the CFI is: too laid back, too stern, genuinely concerned about your learning, or distracted. Hey, it's your money! If it doesn't feel right have a discussion with your instructor, or request another CFI.
 There are advantages to both.
 Periodically, you'll have what are called Stage Checks. Stage Checks are done with a different CFI. This is to ensure you are progressing in accordance with the training syllabus.
 It depends on your situation and what your aviation goals are. Your CFI and/or your school will be able to help you decide which course is best for you.
