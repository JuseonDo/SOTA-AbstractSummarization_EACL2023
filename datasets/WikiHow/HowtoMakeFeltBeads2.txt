 Pull the fibers apart, separating them., Make it as tight as you can but don't worry about flyaway pieces. This ball will end up being about half the size as a bead, so keep this in mind when forming it., Use a felting tool or needle to start locking the fibers together. Push the tool in and out of the center of the felt ball., Manipulate the loose fibers so that they poke back into the ball and leave a smooth outer layer. When you are happy that the ball is round and as smooth as possible, proceed to wetting it., Fill with hot water, as hot as you can stand to put your hands into., Then roll it between both of your palms. The fibers will begin to fuse as you roll it. Dip it back in now and then and roll again. Press harder as the ball gets firmer, to firm it even more., This will usually take one to two minutes per ball., Repeat to make as many felt bead balls as you need., Use to make jewelry or crafts.
