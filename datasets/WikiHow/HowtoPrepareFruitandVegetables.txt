 Purchase fresh, locally grown produce if you can. Check out farmer's markets, local produce stands and your grocery store. Most grocery and food stores carry organic fruits and vegetables, which may be more expensive, but provide the guarantee that they were grown without chemicals or hormones.;
, Dry them with a paper towel or clean cloth.
 Run the food under cold water to remove any bacteria, dirt, insects or pesticides. You should do this for produce with skin as well, such as bananas and avocados.


Use a clean vegetable brush to scrub items with a firm surface, such as melons and cucumbers.
 Use the towel to lightly pat the produce to absorb any remaining water.
 Trim the leaves off celery, shuck the husks off corn and remove grapes from their stems.
 Items that you plan to eat fresh, such as apples, carrots, oranges and cucumbers, can be kept at room temperature, but will stay fresh longer if you keep them cool.
 If you plan to cook your produce, keep the pieces as large as you can, and minimize the time they spend cooking or stewing in any liquid. This will retain more nutrients.
 You can do this by steaming, grilling, roasting, baking, microwaving or frying them. They can be mixed with other ingredients including meats, pastas, rice and incorporated into breads and desserts.
 Allowing them to defrost before you cook and eat them may affect their taste.
, Dehydration, heat processing and chemical preservation are some of the recommendations.
