this is not really an endurance training session, for less-than reasonably well-trained and experienced swimmers.

@summary
the intensity is hard.

@summary
to improve the duration of the swim training, you can sustain above your race pace, you need to be able to swim at a faster pace, and have short rest intervals, to allow you to complete a greater total distance than you would otherwise be able to at this pace.

@summary
this is a very hard session that you need to be technically very competent, to get the most out of.

@summary
the early part of the session will feel ok, because you are swimming quite a short distance, and having with a good rest.

, It would correspond to an experienced, strong swimmer racing the Sprint distance.
 So a session might look like this:


8 - 10 x 100m at 1 – 2 seconds faster than race pace, with 20 seconds recovery.
This could develop into 2 sets of a similar session, initially starting with a slightly lower number of repetitions:
2 sets of 7 x 100m @ race pace – 1 second, with 20 seconds recovery and 5 minutes between sets.
 Otherwise, you will find that, under fatigue, your stroke technique goes, and you will be working very hard, but missing the times by quite a margin.
 By the time you get to midway, you should find that the 20 seconds recovery, is only just enough to get your breathing back under control. And by the end, you will be gasping for breath as you start the last few repetitions, and the recovery will be essential!
