@summary
determine how much height you would like to gain on your stilts.

@summary
in the standing position, have someone measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to your elbow.

@summary
,

@summary
add the measurements from #1 and #2 together.

@summary
make the stilt poles: cut the 2”x2” board into two pieces which are each the length determined in #3.

@summary
make the footholds: cut another 2”x2” piece to a length that exceeds the width of your foot by 1”.

@summary
make the foothold supports: cut the 2”x4”x4” board into triangles such that two sides of each triangle are 4” long (the hypotenuse is therefore longer than 4”).

@summary
,

@summary
nail these triangle footholds into the 2”x2” stilt poles.

@summary
take the footholds and place each perpendicular to the stilt pole on top of the triangle foothold support for each stilt.

@summary
if any of the nails are too long, hammer them so that the point faces downward, so as to avoid injury if you fall off the stilts.

@summary
sand down any rough spots on the top of the boards or on the hand holds to make the stilts more comfortable to grip.

 One foot (about 30.5 cm)is recommended for beginners. ;
,, This will be the length of your stilt poles.
 Be cautious to cut the ends so at least one end on each pole (the bottom) is flat, as this will be the surface on which you will be walking.
 A good size is usually 4”-6”. Again, insure that at least one side on each piece is flat, as this side will line up with the long stilt poles.
, You will want to measure to make sure you are nailing these pieces in at the right height. From the bottom of the stilt poles, measure the height you want to gain (from #1) and subtract 2”. This will be where you nail in the top of the triangle, so that one of the 4” surfaces is perpendicular to the stilt pole and the other is parallel to the stilt pole. Two nails should be used to secure each triangle. Hammer one nail in through the bottom of the triangle (1” from the bottom) through the stilt pole first. Hammer the other about 1” above that through the triangle first.
 The foothold should fit nicely on top of the triangle. Make sure the flat side of the foothold is next to the stilt pole. To fix the foothold into place, nail the footholds into both the 2”x2” stilt pole and the foothold supports. Three nails should be hammered in through the top of the foothold, at a 45 degree angle to the foothold, through the support and stilt pole.
,, You can now try to walk on your stilts! Happy walking!
