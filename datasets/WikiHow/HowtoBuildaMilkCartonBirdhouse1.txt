 Milk left inside the carton can mix with birdseed and go moldy. Ensure that the container is properly dry before proceeding.;
, When it dries, draw a design of your choosing on the milk carton with the pencil. Make it creative but keep in mind you will be painting in the design next, so keeping it simple is not a bad thing.
 Alternatively, you can leave it white and only color in some parts of it; however, it might look a bit plain and might not attract the birds.
 In the middle of the milk carton, directly in the center, cut a hole for the birds to go in too. The bigger the hole you cut, the bigger the birds that will be attracted to the nest in the birdhouse; Just be careful not to cut the hole too big, as the milk carton only has room for birds as large as a robin and as small as a sparrow.
 Starting at the very top, in the tab of the milk carton where the pour spout is, go in a half of an inch from the outside corner and a half an inch from the top, then punch in a hole. Do the same to the other side.
 The length should be determined by however high or low you wish to hang the birdhouse. The twine or wire simply goes through the holes in the tab of the milk carton, one piece of wire or twine per hole, and up to the tree branch or to whatever you are hanging the birdhouse from.


Be sure to tie the knots or twist the wire securely and test it. You wouldn't want a bird to build a nest and it fall.
 Make sure you put dry grass or some fluff for the birds to have a comfortable seat when they move into your custom made birdhouse!
