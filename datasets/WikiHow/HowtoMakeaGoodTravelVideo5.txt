 Many digital video cameras and computers come with video editing software. You can also purchase inexpensive software online.

 Listen to your narration and show what you tell.
, Local music or something that captures the feel of your travel destination is best.
 Follow the "10 second rule" of film production: Every 10 seconds should be an "ah-ha" or interesting moment. Take out anything that is boring, shaky, or sounds bad. Try to keep your video under 5 minutes for web distribution. If you have a lot of interesting footage and a strong story, you can try a longer format and archive on DVD. However, making a good travel video sometimes means keeping it short. Think of it as a video postcard. Keep the action moving and never let the story drag with long-winded commentary or redundant footage.
