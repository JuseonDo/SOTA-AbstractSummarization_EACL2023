@summary
learn a bit of terminology.

@summary
learn the differences between normal bead weaving and seed bead weaving.

@summary
warp the loom for seed bead weaving.

@summary
string the loom so that you can slip the thread off the dowel holder without clipping all the threads.

@summary
tie the other end down with a double knot as well (on the opposite side from your starter knot) around the pin on the dowel.

@summary
thread your needle and secure the weft thread (white) with a double knot to the warp thread (pink).

@summary
slip 8 beads onto your needle and pass it through under the warp threads.

@summary
push the needle back through the beads over the top of the warp threads, making sure that you do not split the thread.

@summary
,

@summary
continue weaving your beads until you have reached the required length for your item.

@summary
thread and sew the beginning weft thread through a row of beads to tidy it off.

@summary
loosen one dowel slightly and turn the pin towards the woven strip so that the threads can fall off the pin.

@summary
,

@summary
lift all the threads off being careful not to pull on them and so warp your strip.

@summary
gently lift your work over the loom and it will automatically slip off the pin on the other side.

@summary
instead of loose threads hanging off the sides, you should now have little loops.

@summary
,

@summary
start with a thread at or near the centre, to leave enough thread either side of the bracelet to finish off your work and still have enough thread to add a clasp.

@summary
,

@summary
hold the work firmly in one hand and start by pulling the centre thread.

@summary
continue doing this until all the threads are pulled through.

@summary
,

@summary
use the two remaining threads to add a clasp or finish the piece however you want.

Warp Thread: The long, strong thread running over the loom
Weft Thread: The thread you string the beads onto and then weave under and over the warp thread, creating the weft thread
Dowel: The round wooden stick at either end of the loom.;
, In particular, Be careful not to split the thread with the needle as you work your way across the warp, as you will then not be able to pull your warp thread through the weft thread.
 Tie one end of the thread onto the pin on the dowel.



Pull the thread over the top of the loom and wind around the pin on the other dowel. Make sure that the thread ends up in the groves on the top of your loom, such that the thread is straight as possible.
Pull the thread over the loom and then wind it under the pin and over the top of the loom again. Make sure to always use a separate set of groves. Continue warping the loom with sufficient threads to accommodate the required number of beads to obtain the width of your piece. You will need one more thread than the number of beads. This will also depend on the size of the beads you are using, if the beads you are using are bigger than the spaces between the threads, go back and add an extra empty grove in between each thread.
Thread from the outside in. This is to keep the threads tidy on the pins and prevent a bunch of knots when the threads are removed from the loom.



This way of warping is absolutely essential for this method.
 Here, there is enough thread on the loop to hold 8 beads.
 With your other hand, push the beads up through the threads.
, You also may need to add another weft thread, to do so, just repeat the steps for adding the first weft thread. Once the desired length is reached, work the thread back and forth a few rows. Make sure this row is secure so the beads don’t fall off.
 The weaving part is done. The rest is finishing.
, Snip only the thread that is knotted, just above the knot.
 Again, snip only the thread that is knotted, just above the knot.
,, Then take it one row at a time on either side of the centre.


Keep the tension even. Don’t pull the thread too tightly as this will cause your beadwork to scrunch up. If you do pull it too tightly, just smooth it out again. After each pull, your thread will become longer. Continue like this until you have pulled all the threads through.
You will also notice that you once you have pulled a thread through, the ends are pulled completely onto the bead. On the left hand side, the thread (which was the long thread) is now also pulled completely onto the bead.
