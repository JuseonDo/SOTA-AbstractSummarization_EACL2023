 If you are using metal rulers, align them and clamp them with your vise as you cut. Cut at exactly the three inch mark on one end, and the twenty six and 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) mark on the other. Brush up ends with a file or bench grinder.
 For example, you can make five holes., You can drill a hole and then cut to it with a hacksaw to make the notch. Drill holes big enough for your 3/4” wood screws to fit through. Now drill holes at 1 ½”, 7”, 9 ½”, and 14 ½” from the same side you cut the notch from., You can use the pre-drilled holes, but they will be larger than your screw and will allow for lots of wiggle room., Mark the place for your holes and drill them or, if you have a vise, clamp the board and bar together while you drill. Make sure to protect your wood. Fasten the metal piece with the ¾” wood screws., Drill the holes for it. Fasten with two of the wood screws it comes with., Place the attachment snugly against the cutter. You can clamp it together using the C clamps and a couple boards on the top and bottom. Or you can just mark the position of the holes. Note that these holes must be exact. Drill the holes. There should be three, one on the front and two on the side. Make them just smaller than the outside of the fittings with the machine screw threads on the inside (supply # 9). Before screwing in the fittings put some welders glue on them, following the glue’s directions. This will ensure that the do not come out, as the cutter’s wood is soft., Place the cut yardstick an top toward the bar edge. Place a square along the cutting edge and against the ruler to make it square. The yardstick inch marks and the square inch marks should be aligned. Drill the holes and fasten it with the 5/8” wood screws.,
