 Paired blades are like the ones Asajj Ventress wields: dual blades that can be attatched and detached to form a saberstaff., Use the main forms. This is important because, if you detach your lightsabers, and then lose one, you only have one blade left., Learn which is best for each situation., If you change modes partway through a battle, it can surprise your opponent. This can work out to your advantage.
