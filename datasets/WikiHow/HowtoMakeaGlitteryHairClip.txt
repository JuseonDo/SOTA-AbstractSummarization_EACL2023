 The clips should be plain and have a nice smooth surface, to enable the glitter to adhere with ease.
 This will catch excess glitter and it's easy to pick up printer paper to rescue as much glitter for reuse as possible., Coat it well so that the glitter will stick on with ease., Sprinkle liberally, so that the glitter completely covers the clip., Hold it up over the printer paper and shake off any excess glitter. Collect up the excess glitter and save it for the next barrette., Once the polish, Mod Podge or glue has dried, apply another coat or two of polish, Mod Podge or glue over the top of the clip to protect it. Allow the sealant layer to dry fully., The glittery hair clips are now ready to wear.
