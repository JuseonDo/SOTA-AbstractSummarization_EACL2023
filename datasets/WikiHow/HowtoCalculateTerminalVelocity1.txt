@summary
use the terminal velocity formula, v = the square root of ((2*m*g)/(ρ*a*c)).
@article
 Plug the following values into that formula to solve for v, terminal velocity.m = mass of the falling object
g = the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth this is approximately 9.8 meters per second per second.
ρ = the density of the fluid the object is falling through.
A = the projected area of the object. This means the area of the object if you projected it onto a plane that was perpendicular to the direction the object is moving.
C = the drag coefficient. This number depends on the shape of the object. The more streamlined the shape, the lower the coefficient. You can look up some approximate drag coefficients here.;
