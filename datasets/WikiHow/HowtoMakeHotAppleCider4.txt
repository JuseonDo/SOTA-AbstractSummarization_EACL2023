If the butter isn't already softened, melt in a separate pan. Don't overheat though, just a quick melt.
 Add the sugar. Warm up over medium heat until simmering but not boiling, about 4 minutes. Stir frequently to ensure that the sugar doesn't stick.
 Add the apple brandy if using. Top each one with a dollop of mashed butter.
 The butter will melt through each drink, leaving a warm, buttery feeling.
