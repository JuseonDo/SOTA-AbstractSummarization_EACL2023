make sure you know the snell's law.

@summary
find out the refractive index of the substance (or nx).

,

@summary
you can now do the substitution.

@summary
the critical angle is therefore 41.8°.

@article
 The general form of Snell's Law is nxsinθx=nvacuumsinθvacuum, where n is the refractive index and θ is the angle of incidence or refraction.;
,, Let's say you are using glass with a refractive index of 1.50. Therefore, the critical angle is the angle which, when it is the angle of incidence, produces an emergent ray of 90°.


nglasssinθglass=nvacuumsinθvacuum





1.50sinθglass=1sin90°






sinθglass=2/3






θglass=41.8° (correct to 3 significant figures)
