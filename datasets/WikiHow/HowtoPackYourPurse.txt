 Choose a wallet that has enough pockets for your bank card, credit cards, etc. Make sure the wallet also fits into your purse. Also, keep an identification in your wallet in case the wallet is lost or stolen.;
, Also pack a mirror, hair bands, bobby pins, small hairbrush or comb, and a nail file.
 You don't want to be surprised and unprepared, and you may need to lend supplies to another girl. Some emergency Advil or Tylenol can be useful, too.
 You can also purchase extra batteries and keep them charged so they can be switched throughout the day.
 It's better to have them and not use them than to be locked out of the house or having to call for help.
 You may need to write down a phone number, a schedule change, or an important reminder.
 A runny nose can be a pain (not to mention embarrassing!).
, Even if you think it's unnecessary, you never know when you'll need a band-aid or a small tube of anti-biotic ointment.
, This way, you can temporarily fix a ripped shirt or shorts.
 Make a list of it, and be sure to put these items in your purse, along with some emergency items as well.
