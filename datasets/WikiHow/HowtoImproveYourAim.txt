 Try to focus on the spot and line up your arm with your line of sight.


If you are throwing a pointed object like a dart then try to make it's tip line up with the object.;
, While aiming, your hand should not shake. Stop for a moment and take a deep breath to steady yourself.
 Make sure that the throw is light and not too forceful as too much force will cause the object you are throwing to veer off course.


Imagine an arc from your arm to the target and try to throw it in that direction.Try to give the object a spin so that it stays on course.
 Practice makes perfect, the more you practice aiming the better you get.


Keep practicing for a couple of hours daily.
