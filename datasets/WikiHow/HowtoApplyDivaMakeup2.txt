 Like under-eye bruises, acne and redness.;
, Apply all over your face, including the eye lids. However if you don't have it, feel free to use foundation if you desire to, but it won't give the painted-finish effect BB cream does.
, Preferably volumizing and lengthening mascara, but any would do as long as it's bold. Apply the eyeliner however you wish.
 This will make the lips seem fuller and plumper, and professionally done.
 If you're allowed to wear bronzer, apply in a number 3 shape (temples to hollows of cheekbones to chin) on either side of your face. If you can wear blush, apply to the apples of your cheeks and cheekbones! You may use one or both if you like.



Alternatives for the white eyeshadow include highlighting powder, and white eyeliner (blend if you choose this method). But just use whatever is best for you.
 You may need to keep it in a purse so you can reapply during the day.
