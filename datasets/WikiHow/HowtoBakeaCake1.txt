 Pound cake is one of the simplest cakes to bake. Here's what you'll need:


1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
Pinch of salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
5 eggs
2 cups cake flour;
,, Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans.
 Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.
 Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.
 Keep the hand mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix it.
 Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
 The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
