practice with chewing gum.

@summary
start out with small portions of food; first soft food, like ice-cream or yogurt.

@summary
once you have mastered it with the soft foods, try chewing larger portions at a time, as you would normally eat.

@summary
move on to the more solid foods now, like fruits, rice, and bread.

@summary
once you are past this stage, try the hardest foods, such as granola bars and cereals.
@article
 Close your mouth and chew with your back teeth. Use one or two sticks of gum for this practice. Remember to breathe through your nose, not through your mouth.;
, Put a little bit of the food into your mouth. Now close your mouth, chewing with only your back teeth. Chew slowly; this helps you keep your mouth closed.
 This is no reason to open your mouth. Still chew with it closed.
 Follow the same principle: small portions at first, then slowly work your way up. Chew slowly.
 While these may make noise, it is no excuse to open your mouth while chewing.
