Having "normal debt" means that you could always be sad and broke.
 Use money freed from borrowing (you'll have "free" money), investing that for retirement, or for college or real estate... without borrowing!"

, Make no new loans: No new credit accounts. Rid yourself of "easy pay" plans: Start getting out of debt by concentrating on paying off the smallest, easiest debt first, and include that money into your next pay-off. Use free money, now, but how do you start?

, Sell (or return) your expensive stuff, i.e.: newer car. Trade that bill for an easier life, getting "out from under": pressure of chrome, new styles, posing, fronting... And then what?


Get an older car for about $2000.00 cash, or lower cost motorbike, ie: get a "beat-up" car or bike for cash (no, you are not stuck with that older vehicle).
 You can sell the older one for about as much as you paid for it to help the process in about 10 months, or a year and pay cash for another old, but better car then.


Or, keep that first older car -- if it's okay for another year or two -- and save that money for buying a better car after the second or third year using cash. Believe that you can, and you can.
,, Each liberated payment is rolled into and included as money to continue making the ball of payments bigger to apply to the next item.
