 Have a bottle of jojoba oil at hand. Along with this, have a tube of nail polish with nail polish remover, and apricot exfoliator as well. Needless to say, several napkins or towels will be needed.;
, Tie back all hair in a shower cap, pinning loose ends.
 Start out by massaging the face of this person with Jojoba oil. Sprinkle some onto the face and massage within a three to five centimeter radius. When you have made the whole face oily, move on.
 Normally, to use this on a face requires water, but the oil will function the same. Again, massage in a three centimeter radius. Do all parts of the face, including the chin. Start out on cheeks. Keep on going until the whole face is white with paste.
 Wash them and set them onto the eyes of the person to reduce puffiness below the eyes. Take this opportunity now to move on.
 Follow any mistakes with a slight dab of nail polish remover.
 Use more exfoliator and dab on more oil if necessary. The face should not be too dry.
, Dab a paper towel into it and slowly massage the face until there is nothing left in the cup.
 Start with the face. Wet paper towels and set them onto the face, pressing down slightly and squeezing. Once you are done, set a dry paper towel.
