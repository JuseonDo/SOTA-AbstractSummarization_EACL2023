@article
 Flex your ab muscles, and pull your legs toward your chest, while you lean back slightly. You should form a "V" sitting position, as you rest on your tailbone.
 Straighten your legs and lean back slightly as you exhale. You may find yourself hitting the back of the chair during this exercise, but try not to rest any weight on it.
 Slowly lower your feet to the ground when you are done. Rest for 1 minute and then repeat 1 or 2 more times.









This is an advanced exercise, and a variation on a pilates posture, which is usually performed on a mat. Only attempt this exercise when you are able to keep good form throughout all the other exercises. Your back should remain straight during the entire exercise.
