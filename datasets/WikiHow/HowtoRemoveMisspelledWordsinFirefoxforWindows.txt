 The easiest way to do this is as follows:


Open a folder onto your desktop.
In the upper right hand corner of the folder, type in 'persdict.dat' in the search box. It will, by default, look in the Libraries folder, and needless to say, won't find it.
Underneath the words, 'Search again in:', click on Computer so that it will look through all of your computer.;
, Or alternatively, click .
In the middle of the first section (Application Basics) is Profile Directory, with a button to Open Containing Folder. Click it.






persdict.dat should be in the folder that opens - scroll down or search for it.
 Your computer may not know what to open it with. Select the WordPad (or Notepad) program to edit it with.
 Look closely. Some of the words will be pretty easy to miss. Here are three misspellings that have been found.


Don't be surprised to see some odd characters in the file. Those are accents and such that are added to words, such as in the circled word in the list screenshot above (with this screenshot showing how it appears when published).
 Look over it a couple of times, or better yet, have someone else look it over.
 Press CTRL S (or click on the floppy in the upper left corner) to save.
 The misspelled words should now have been removed.
