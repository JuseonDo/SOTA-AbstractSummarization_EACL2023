, Be sure to switch it back and forth during your walk.
 It could be something like a foam pad, rubber ball, flashlight, camera, etc.
 You may be doing that unconsciously, so pay attention.
 Do this fairly often and for a few seconds at a time. Move them around like you are playing an instrument.
 Don't do it suddenly or in an extreme fashion. You can hurt your shoulders.
, Keep your arms bent at an almost 90 degree angle. Be sure that your shoulders are relaxed and that you aren't opening and closing your arms at the elbows.
 This is bringing your hands up above your heart and you aren't bending your arms too much.
 When you walk, more than likely, you will sweat (if you are doing it right, anyway). Be careful not to drink too much, but be sure to be hydrated. If you don't want to carry water with you, (okay for a shorter walk), be sure to have at least a glass of water in the hour before you walk. Also, drink up when you come home.

Although not as 'refreshing', water that is less cold is easier for your body to absorb.
