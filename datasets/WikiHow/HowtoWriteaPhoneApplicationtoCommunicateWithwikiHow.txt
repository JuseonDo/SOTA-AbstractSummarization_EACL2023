 The choice of the OS is critical as it can limit your options on the choice of programming languages. Many mobile operating systems only support a few programming languages by default. Here are some of the most commonly used operating systems and the programming languages available for those OSs:


BlackBerry OS. Programming Language: Java. Software will run only on BlackBerry Devices.
iOS (known as iPhone OS prior to June 2010). Applications will run on iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Programming Language: Objective-C. An iOS SDKis also available.
Android. Programming Language: Java with the possibility of adding C and C++ code.
Windows Phone 7. C, C++, .NET Compact Framework Languages. Applications will only run on Windows 7 mobile devices.
Symbian. Programming Languages: C++, Java.;
, The list provided above only includes the main programming language for a platform/OS. Sometimes, third-party hacks and tools exist to run a different programming languages. Some languages of choice might be:


C++/C. Many mobile operating systems support C/C++ code one way or the other. The language itself is a long established one.
Java/Java ME(formerly, J2ME). Has been the language of choice for many mobile applications for a long time.
.NET Compact Framework Languages (C#, VB.NET, Managed C++). More suitable for Windows 7 devices, but gaining popularity on Linux based systems via third-party tools.
Objective-C is the language of choice for iOS devices.
