 You may have wondered before how to get new game modes: Team Slayer, King of the Hill, Juggernaut. Here's how to do it.
,, Just select CTF.
 Now, you should see Computer's Desktop screen again.
, Copy that by right-clicking and selecting Copy.
,,,, click OK.
 Now you're back at the Halo screen.
, What you did in the previous steps was essentially replace the information the file available to you (CTF, or Folder 32) with information from a file unavailable to you (Team Slayer, or Folder 34). You'll always paste the information into Folder 32. To access these different modes, copy the information out of the folder number listed and paste into Folder 32.
