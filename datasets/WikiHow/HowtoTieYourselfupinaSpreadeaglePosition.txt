 If you're using the variant with three chains and one rope, position the rope where your main hand will be.;
, Don't use a slipknot, as it might get really tight as you struggle, which might stop your blood flow. Remember that if you spread your legs too much it might get very uncomfortable over time.
,, If you position the knot itself behind your palm, it will be nearly impossible to escape by yourself. Of course, a handcuff is easier to use but not everyone has one.
