@summary
consider autotrader, which is an online seller of anything vehicular or transportation related.

@summary
use the website's search engine to narrow the vehicles available at the price and condition you want when you are buying.
@article
 The Internet portion of AutoTrader supports the magazine.


Unlike eBay, there is no auction part to AutoTrader. There are only advertisement listing charges, and these all fall on the seller.
You can submit your own photos to appear with the ad as with eBay. AutoTrader will walk you through the process of uploading a photo.
 Then, contact the seller and make your deal.
