@summary
with a mahogany telescope, the time window is so short that you can choose to always wait at the first landing spot.

@summary
if you're waiting at a landing spot, you may consider running from the spot one minute before the last possible landing time (or rather 50 seconds, to allow for the landing animation).
@article
 Use a stopwatch to find out when you can give up waiting and run for the next spot. You risk falling behind, though, if the star lands early and you spend another minute or two waiting at the wrong spot. On the other hand, you have the advantage of already being out in the field, while someone running from their house will take some time even getting to the area.
 By then, the chance of it landing where you are is smaller than the chance of it having already landed somewhere else. The downside is that you may have to run back to the first spot, or even the second if you ran past that before final landing time had passed.
