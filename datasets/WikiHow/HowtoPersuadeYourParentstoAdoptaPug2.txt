Â Giving up time to your Pug cause tells your parents you're getting ready. Find out where in your area to shop for food, what supplies you need for getting and training a new puppy, and which vets are the best.
 If you think you'll have a pug soon and you can go out on your own, possibly buy a leash and harness or pads for when they're being house-trained.
 Design a presentation and explain the pros and cons of a Pug. Show them Pugs are hard to care for, but you're ready.
(If they wanted a dog but can't have one, you may have made the Pug seem less hard to care for!)
