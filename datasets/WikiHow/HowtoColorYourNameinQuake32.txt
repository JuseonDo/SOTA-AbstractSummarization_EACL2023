 There are many websites around the Internet which have opportunities for download, but the author found this one the easiest.
 This will be found within the (C:) drive.
 However, Name Changer will run automatically if you checked the box when finishing the installation.
 Name Changer can be used to color your name without having to use the ^ character. Instead, colors can simply be selected with the mouse from the color pane of Name Changer. With NC you can also add special symbols and pictures by clicking on Keypad.
 Your character in Quake 3 will now be configured with the customized name you have made.
