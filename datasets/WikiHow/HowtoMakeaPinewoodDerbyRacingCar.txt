 Sketch on a piece of paper the size of your block of wood. Some ideas are above, but pretty much any shape will do.


The fastest cars look like a wedge, with the front narrow.
If you or someone who will help you is very good at cutting wood, you can do something fancy (like a hot dog or a car with windows.) If its your first time, you may want to do something simple.
 There are plenty of kits available, but the pine wood and nails can come from any hardware store. You will probably need to buy the wheels from a hobby store, because many races require a certain size of wheel. See below for the list of supplies.
 If you will do it yourself, get a coping saw and a clamp. Many scoutmasters or hardware stores will cut the wood for you if you ask.
,, Sanding makes the paint stick better, and also makes the car go faster. You can use 120 grit sandpaper to start.



Many thin coats are better than 1 thick coat, as it has less chance to run or drip and spoil the looks of the car.
Let the car dry between coats, and sand after the paint has dried.
The final sanding should use 200 grit sandpaper.
After sanding, you can attach whatever decals or lettering you might want.
 Put the wheel on the nail axle and put it on your car, maybe tapping lightly with a hammer. Some races allow graphite lubricant on the axle.
 The weight limit is 5oz(141g.) If it's over weight, drill some out. If it's under, you can attach some weights.
