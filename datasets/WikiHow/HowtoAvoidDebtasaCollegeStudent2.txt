 Never think that you are not going to win. If the guidelines say that you are eligible, then apply.
 Depending on the college, this is usually November 1st or December 1st. By applying before Regular Decision, you become eligible for a larger range of scholarships granted by the institution.
 This stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Depending on your family's financial position, you may be eligible for grants, low-interest loans, and work-study. Don't wait too long. Otherwise, your institution may run out of funds, leaving you with nothing even if you were eligible for a certain amount.
 Most likely, you are probably still dependent on your parents. Just ask them for money or assistance when you find yourself in trouble to avoid making a bad situation worse. In return, remember to call home sometimes
