 If your app is suitable for specific screen resolutions, sizes, etc., include only the devices that support these features.;

 Global statistics will help you define which are the leading models, notwithstanding their sphere of use. Also, consider region and market statistics.
 Understanding the current trends will help you to predict which brands are likely to become the new leaders in the market, as well as specific devices.
 Compare and compile all the lists from the above. If some specific devices haven’t been mentioned yet, consider adding them, too.
