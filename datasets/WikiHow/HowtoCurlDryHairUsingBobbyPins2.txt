 This will make separating hair strands less tedious, and it's also quite healthy to brush your hair daily.
 This will prevent the curls getting mixed up.
 Start wrapping the strands of hair around the (closed) bobby pin, creating a spring-like shape. Don't worry about loose strands.
 Carefully insert the curls between the tongs. If you have thinner hair you can use an elastic band about the size of a rainbow loom band and tie it onto the curls.
 The final product should look like it was done with hair rollers. Sleep with the curls overnight.
 These curls will last for a few hours (without hairspray) and then turn into somewhere between naturally wavy to a mix between curly and wavy.
