 Bring it to a boil and cook the beans until they are bright green and still crispy, about 8 minutes.
 Cook the bacon in the microwave for about a minute, or until it is partially cooked but not brown and crispy. Cut each piece of bacon in half using a knife or a kitchen scissors. Set the pieces aside on a plate.


If you do not have a microwave, this step can also be completed in a skillet on the stove or in the oven.
 Use a paper towel to pat them dry.
 Secure the bacon in place with a toothpick and set it on a plate. Continue bunching beans, wrapping them in bacon, and securing the bacon with toothpicks until all of the beans and bacon have been used.
 Use a whisk to combine the ingredients well. Working one at a time, dip the green bean bunches into the sauce. Be sure to coat them on all sides. Lay the coated green bean bunches on a baking sheet or baking pan.
 Cook for 15 minutes, or until the bacon is brown and crispy. Remove from the oven and serve.
