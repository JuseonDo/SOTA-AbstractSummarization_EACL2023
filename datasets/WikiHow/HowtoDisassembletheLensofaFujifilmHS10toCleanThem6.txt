the rest of the re-assembly is backwards of what you did:

They have some kind of a "guide".



Just align those marks together and gently lower the lens of the springs.



Why? because you will screw them: "one turn" at a time on every screw.
The idea is to lower the lens evenly, and make sure you don't over-screw them into cracking the lens.

Putting the screws on, don't over- tighten them!
Put the 2-sided tape over the screws.
Put the numbered ring on the tape, and gently-but-firmly apply pressure around it, so that it stays in place until the next clean-up.
