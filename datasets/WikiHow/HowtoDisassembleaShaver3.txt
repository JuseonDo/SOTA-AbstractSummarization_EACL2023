 Do not use scissors or any kind of knife, as these are designed for cutting, not prying.
 Typically, this will be at one end of the shaver rather than on the sides. Look for seams in the plastic, where two or more separate pieces of the shaver's body come together.


If the blade is held on with a plastic guard, the seam between this piece and the rest of the shaver's body is your target.
 Gently push the handle towards the shaver. This will pry the piece up, away from the shaver.
 You should ideally use the screwdriver for this, and avoid touching the blade's edge with your fingers.
 Once you remove the top guard, you can slip the razor blade(s) out of their setting and use them to replace the used one.
