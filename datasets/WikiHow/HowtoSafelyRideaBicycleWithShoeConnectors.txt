 You will need to purchase your bicycle shoes at the same time (to install the shoe part of the clips into), unless you already own a pair. Do not leave until you have engaged the clips and disengaged the clips. You don't want to find yourself stuck in them. Have the professional adjust the clips so that they are firm, but easy to disengage (by twisting your feet).;
, The greatest danger faced by a bicyclist using shoe connectors is the sudden (unexpected) stop. If the shoes are still connected to the pedals, the rider will fall over, hitting the cement with his legs and having the bicycle then land on his legs (which hurts even worse). Hopefully, he will not fall over in traffic. It is vitally important that when any potentially dangerous situation arises that the rider disengages from his clips.
 It will lessen the impact of falling over.

Going through gravel, or uneven terrain.
