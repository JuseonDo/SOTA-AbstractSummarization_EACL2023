 See if you can find a tree nearby. Of course, this only works when your subject is portable.;
, Use your body, someone else, cardstock, or anything that will work.
 You will need to learn how to do that with your own camera, but using a flash when you are outside, will help counter the bright sun and the unfortunate shadows that it creates.
, Shoot straight down or straight up. This changes the angle of the bright sun that you are dealing with.
 This helps protect your lens from the brightness of the sun.
 Polarizing and neutral density filters are some good ones that help with your photography.
 If you set it, then all of your shots will have identical white balance. That way, even if you have to adjust settings, you can apply the same ones to all of the photographs.
 This allows you to have more to work with. With today's software, you can still do a lot with your JPG images, but RAW gives you a little more to work with.
 This will help your camera 'focus' on what it needs to.
 Instead of going out there at noon, try going during the 'golden hour'. This is the hour right before the sun sets and rises.
 You can make some stunning images doing that.
