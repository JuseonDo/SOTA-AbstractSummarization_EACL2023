 Pick a good look, but most importantly, good spells. It's important to have a variety of defensive and offensive spells. Members can have all of the spells, but non-members only get the first two books. A few spells I highly recommend are: Arcane Flash; Arcane Arrow; Arcane Tower; Arcane Gate; Arcane Bomb; Fire Ball; Lava Bomb; Flame Shield; Napalm; Rain of Fire; Fire Arrow; Rain of Arrows. You don't have to have these. I've just had good experiences with them.;
, Use variety if possible.
 It'll heal them.
 Most of them get repelled, but you get a good fire ball or napalm in if you're close enough. If you can, get below them, Fireshields don't come into effect from below. If you're a member, you can use "Blast from the Past" to deactivate their shield (not visually).
 That shows you're a coward. Yes, if you're low on health or want to get your defenses up, hide. But come back out into the heat of battle.
 But, don't be hesitant to use them, if you do, you will have wasted spells.
 It's a pain in the rear if you miss and have to wait for the attack to come back.
 Try it at your enemies as well as plain land. If you do a good job, the enemy can't move!Napalm can shoot through thin walls, so if there is a thin wall blocking you from your enemy you can shoot Napalm through and hit them.
