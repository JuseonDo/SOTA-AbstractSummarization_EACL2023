 Do this by sliding the tool between the gap of the chrome backing and the front faceplate. After working your way steadily around the iPod, the back will pop off.;
, You now need to remove the rechargeable battery.


Do so by carefully prying it upward. It is glued to the iPod so it'll take some effort to remove it.
 It is attached to the battery and is secured with 4 screws. Keep the screws safely nearby.
 The digitizer is held in place by 16 tiny screws. Keep the screws in a safe place.
 Do this by unplugging your broken LCD screen carefully (you can see the black plug in the image), then plug in your new LCD screen.
 If you are replacing your outer protective screen proceed to the next step.
