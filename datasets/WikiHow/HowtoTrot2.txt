 You're not ready to trot until you're 100 percent confident with the walking.
, Your helper should start to make your horse go from a walk to a trot and while you're getting used to it. Loosen your rains and hold the saddle.
 Start to rise as the horse's shoulder goes forward. Go down as its shoulder comes back.
 Then squeeze your horse a bit more tightly than you would normally do and the horse should trot.


If your horse starts slowing down squeeze in again.
If your horse starts to go into a canter, don't panic. Just gently pull the reins in a bit until your horse goes into a trot again.
 It is often a lot easier to canter than trot as it is less constrained.
