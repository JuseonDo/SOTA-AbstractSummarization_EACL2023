You can add paint during the initial kneading while making the cold porcelain, but this will reduce its shelf life.
 Every time you use a new piece of clay, knead it first to increase its elasticity.
 Well made, kneaded cold porcelain should be easy to sculpt and capable of forming delicate designs.
 To attach two wet pieces of cold porcelain, press them together and smooth over the joint with a wet finger.


Dry pieces can be glued together using ordinary white glue.
 Cold porcelain shrinks significantly as it dries, and a large piece may not dry sufficiently all the way through. Instead, cover a different material with a layer of the clay.
 Cold porcelain requires no additional cooking and will harden simply when exposed to air.


How long this takes depends greatly on the size of your sculpture, the temperature, and the humidity of the air. Keep checking until it is hard.
 Without a seal, your cold porcelain art will be vulnerable to "melting" in heat or water, although you should still keep sealed art in a cool dry place when possible.There are many types of sealant and lacquers intended for clay, with various glossy or matte finishes. Clear acrylic sealer is a simple transparent option.
