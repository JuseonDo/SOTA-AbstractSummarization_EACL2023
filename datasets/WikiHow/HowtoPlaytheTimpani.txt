@summary
first, you will have to know how to read bass clef music.

@summary
sit on a spinning stool in front of however many timpani you need to play.

@summary
make sure you have timpani mallets.

@summary
to tune a timpani, you will need a pitch pipe, or if there is a vibraphone nearby, it will work just as well because its keys will not go out of tune.

@summary
read the music just as you would any other music, making sure that you are playing the right drums at the right time, depending on where they are located in front of you and where the notes are located on the staff.

@article
 The spaces on the staff, going from bottom to top are: A, C, E, G (acronym- All Cars Eat Gas). The lines going from bottom to top are: G, B, D, F, A (Glad Bags Don't Fall Apart).;
, They should be arranged in a semi circle around you so that they are easy to reach. Make sure the timpani are almost (but not) touching and that you don't need to pull your elbow out or in to reach any of the drums.
 There are different ones for the different sound you want to get out of the timpani. Some people use a French grip which is like matched grip for snare, except the wrists are turned so that the thumbs are pointed upward. You can also grip the mallets like you would with matched grip. Either is correct.
 Before you begin tuning, move the pedal as far down as it will go so the timpani plays the lowest possible note. Gradually increase the pitch by pushing the pedal forwards. If you go past the desired pitch, start back at the lowest note again. Make sure that, when checking the music to see what notes you will be playing, the higher note will go on the smaller drum and the lower note will go on the bigger drum. The drums should also be arranged largest to smallest because this makes the music much more easier to read.
