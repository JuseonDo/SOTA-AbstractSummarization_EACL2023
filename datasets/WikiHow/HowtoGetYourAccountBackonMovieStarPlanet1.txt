 Most people get tricked into sharing their passwords and losing their account. To avoid this, never share your password.;
, The café chatroom is notorious for being the home of hackers who want to steal your account.
 Don't friend them. They may hack you.
 It's probably a trick and you should immediately block them. The only way people can give you VIP is by sending you a vip ticket or certificate code.
