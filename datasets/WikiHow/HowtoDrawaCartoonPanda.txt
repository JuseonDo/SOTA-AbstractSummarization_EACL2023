 In the middle and close to the bottom draw a small circle. The small circle should be close to the space where you didn't finish the bigger circle.;
, One hand should be covering the place where you didn't finish the bigger circle. The hands and feet are both black, so you won't see a line that defines both individually.
 They should start a 10 and 2 'o' clock and end at 8 and 4.
 The top of the blackness should start right where the ears end.
, Just put semi-circles in the ears and ovals in the feet.
