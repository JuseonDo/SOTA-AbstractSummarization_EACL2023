 Once at the quest "Alduin's Wall", you are required to find Sky Haven Temple. It is quite simple to find, just follow your quest map marker.;
, In this, you must kill Paarthurnax but in doing so, you will lose the GreyBeards.
 She will say that she needs three of your followers to join the blades.
 All you must do is bring a follower to her and she will induct them into the blades. When three followers have been made into blades, you can hunt dragons with them!
