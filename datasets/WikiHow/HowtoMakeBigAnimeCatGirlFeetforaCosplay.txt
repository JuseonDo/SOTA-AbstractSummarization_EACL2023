 In this case you'll need them wide and fat, so extend them on either side and add the toes at the front.
,, Cut out pieces of polyfoam and glue them to fill in the sides of the slippers where the canvas extends beyond the slipper., Glue it in place., You can use scissors for doing this, or you can buy a tool for cutting foam.







If, as you're cutting and shaping the toes, you accidentally cut off too much and make them look blocky, fill in the gaps with batting.
 Experiment with something cheap that you don't mind throwing away until you get a shape that will fit around your foot. Use the image as a guide for the desired shape. If the fabric is only 2 way stretch, make sure you cut it so it stretches horizontally., When you cut it out and fold it in half it should be similar to this. Sew the edges together, forming a tube of sorts. You will also need to sew elastic casing on the narrow end so that it doesn't slip down when you're wearing it. Put it on your foot while you're wearing the slipper., Pin it to the sock you made in the previous step. This image shows a white fabric being pinned for demonstration purposes, but yours should be the same color as your sock., Sew on the sole and flip back right side out.

You can add a bias tape elastic casing to the top, necessary to keep it from slipping down.
, Otherwise it will slide around., Use embroidery thread to pinch the fabric in place and tie it underneath.,, Just cut them out of felt and glue them on., It will keep your fabric from getting dirty and provide a grip so you don't slide around on floors. It's recommended that you use the thickest craft foam you can find.,,
