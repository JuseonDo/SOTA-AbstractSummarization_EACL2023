 This short outline is a great way to get a feel for the country, city, state, location, etc. you plan to visit. If you want a more detailed and historical overview, check out the Understand section below the introduction.
 You can learn about the districts, towns, regions, cities, states, etc. of a particular area at the top of the article. This would be more important if you intend to plan several side trips as opposed to spending the bulk of your time in one city.
 Under the "Get In" section, you will find useful information about transportation options into the area, as well as any immigration/customs procedures. Once you have that figured out, refer to the "Get Around" section for advice on transportation at your destination.
 You'll find listings of the most popular sights, landmarks, attractions, events, etc. available to the average tourist.
 You will find information about where to go for the best shopping, and what souvenirs are worth seeking out.
 There are listings for everything from budget eateries to expensive, refined establishments which you should consider.
 Under the Sleep section, you can pick which hotels, motels, hostels, or bed-and-breakfasts to stay at for the duration of or at least part of your trip.
 The information here is important to know should you be the victim of a crime (and how to avoid becoming one), or if you experience a medical emergency.
 See the "Go Next" section for ideas on where to travel next from your original destination, whether it be a different city down the road or a whole other country.
