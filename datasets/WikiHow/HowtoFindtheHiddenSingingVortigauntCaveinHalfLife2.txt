 This is towards the very end of the chapter.;
, You must open this gate to progress further in the level so you can't miss it.
 They will be above ground height and in shade. The left outlet's bars will be bent at the bottom with enough room to enter through.
 It must be close enough to the cliff to jump on and climb through, although the cliff has built in stair-like bumps for you to hop onto.
 It may help to turn on your flashlight to gather your surroundings, but do not waste too much charge as you will need it soon as the sewer is filled with radioactive slime.
 The toxic slime will sap your health, so be quick. It is possible to walk through the sewer if you have a full armour rating and health, but it is easier to sprint (to sprint hold down the Left Bumper on your Xbox 360 controller).
 Although it is hard to see where the gap is in the dim light of the sewer, failing to make the turn will cost valuable health if you're stuck at the end of the sewer.
 Congratulations! You have just found the hidden singing vortigaunt cave! He will be standing around a head crab roasting on a fire, singing to himself and saying philosophical thoughts. If you are on the Xbox 360, simply being there is all that's needed to unlock the Vorticough achievement.
 It is represented by the vortigaunt with musical notes coming from it.
 You will have to sprint back the way you came again through the radioactive slime, so make sure you have enough health and suit power to sprint through.
