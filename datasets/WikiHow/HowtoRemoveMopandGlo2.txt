 You don’t want anything to remain that could scuff the surface.
 Keep a bucket nearby to place damp rags and sponges.
 You may need to get this at a specialty cleaning store.
 Since you shouldn’t use large amounts of water on laminate, you usually have to use harsh chemicals to remove film.
 Apply liberally and clean with scrap rags.
 You may be able to employ a non-stick scrubber sponge or #0000 steel wool to bring up tough film.
 It takes plenty of hard work to get the Mop and Glo up. However, once you’ve removed it, you can use water and a microfiber cloth to clean your laminate flooring.
