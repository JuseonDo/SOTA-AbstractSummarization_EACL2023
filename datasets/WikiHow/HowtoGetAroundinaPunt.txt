 A punt is usually supplied with a pole, seat cushions, and a small paddle (for emergency use only). If selecting a pole yourself, hold it upright and spin it around to check that it is straight.;
, Stand as close to the end as possible and facing to one side. Grip the pole with both hands, holding it vertically and with one end in the water. If you are right-handed, your right hand should be below your left. Ensure that the pole is the correct way up: the bottom end will often have a 'shoe' on it to grip the river bed, which is occasionally mistaken for a handle.
 At the same time, bring your left hand downwards to meet the right. When your hands are close together, reverse the action: lift with your left hand whilst sliding your right hand downwards. Repeat until the pole is clear of the water.
 Do not attempt to lower it gently, as it tends to float.
 Pass it through your hands as if you were trying to climb up it.
,, The pole can now be used like a tiller for steering. If you swing the top end of the pole to the left, the punt will turn to the right and vice versa.
