 It is advisable to set out a separate room for reciting but it is not necessary.;
,, In Jodo Shu Buddhism it means to be mindful of Amida Buddha.
Amida: Amida Buddha's name is made up of two words, originally referring to two different manifestations of Buddha: "Amitabha" and "Amitayus".
Butsu: From "Buddha" originally meaning "awakened one".



During a group practice the rhythm is kept by hitting a "mokugyo", which is a wooden fish.
For this practice it is advisable to use Jodo Shu Juzu to keep track of how many times you recite.
 The usual phrase "Namu Amida Butsu" is repeated by the group but each syllable is prolonged.


The rhythm is usually kept by the group leader with "kaishaku" (wood blocks).
,,


This can even be shortened further to "Namu Amida Butsu", to what sounds like NaManDaBs when saying your nembutsus.
