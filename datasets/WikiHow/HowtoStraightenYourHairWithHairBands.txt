 It's important that you do this so that your hair will be damp and clean.;
, Make sure your hair is wet, then towel dry until it's damp. It shouldn't be soaking wet, but it shouldn't be dry either.
 Do NOT use rubber bands, only ones with a fabric outer coat so that you don't damage your hair.
 If you have thin hair, use 2. If you have thicker hair, use 4.
 Clip/tie the others back. Take a hair band and tie the section as you normally would to make a ponytail at about ear/neck level. Tie another right below the first one without leaving any gaps until you reach the end of the section. Try not to have any hairs sticking out.
 Be careful and pay attention to any stray hairs.
 Get a good night's rest with your bands in!

, If you did it right, your hair should be straight! Of course, it won't be pin straight as if you used a flat iron, but it should come out looking as you want it. There most likely will be a dent near your ears and neck from where the first band was tied. To avoid this, use softer bands at the top of your sections.
 Frizz prone hair might get a little crazy, but this can keep it under control.
 The more you practice this method, the better your results will be!
