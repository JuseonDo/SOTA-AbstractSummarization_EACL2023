 Cut the circle out. Dip a piece of kitchen towel into a little butter and rub it inside of the tin, then pop the paper circle into the base of the tin.;
, Melt these ingredients on a low heat. When the ingredients are melted together remove the pan from the heat and put it to a side.
 Tip the crumbs into the pan. Add cherries, raisins, almonds and apricots to the pan and give the mixture a good stir.
 Press and smooth it down with the back of a metal spoon. Put the cake tin in the fridge and leave it to set overnight. Slide the cake out and onto a plate. Remove the grease proof paper from the underside and then cut into thick wedges using a table knife. Sprinkle your white chocolate wedges with icing sugar to give them a sweet and pretty snow white feel. Serve them with a sprig of fresh mint. Delicious!
