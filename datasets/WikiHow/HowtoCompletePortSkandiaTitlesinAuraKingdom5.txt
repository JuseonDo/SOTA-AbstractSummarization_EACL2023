 Sage is a flower located near the Helonia Coast Portal, found in Timbria Forest.
 Westen, the Painter, will tell you that he's missing an important color for his painting, which is blue. Give the sage to him.


You will obtain the title Budding Artist, which gives +10 Health Points bonus.
Westen is not available in the auto-travel list, but he's not hard to find. The painter will be standing near the Sunbird King's spawn location, right at the top of the cliff.
