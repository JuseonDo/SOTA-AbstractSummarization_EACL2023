trim the hedge down to the lowest point, following the string lines.
@article
 The extra should be enough to wrap around and tie onto the stakes.;
, Hammer into the ground lightly. You can put in stakes and string lines lengthwise and width wise as needed.
 Match the level of the string with the height at which you want to trim the hedge. The string line will act as a guide to get a uniform height and width.
 The final look will be very professional.
