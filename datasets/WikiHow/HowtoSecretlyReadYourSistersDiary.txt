take it somewhere like the bathroom.

@article
 Do you need to know if she's OK? Do you want to know what she thinks of you and/or other people? Are you just a snoop? Did she read yours? Blackmail? If you're just a snoop, you might not want to read it. But the other reasons actually make sense.;
, You can even look at articles about hiding your diary to find where she might hide it. If she's not so bright, it's probably somewhere simple.
 Wait until she is gone for a while- or better yet, out of the house. Make sure she won't come home yet!

, If they're with her, ex., on her neck, wrist, etc., you're out of luck. But some don't- and remember it might be unlocked. Your keys (if you have a lock diary) might work- just be sure not to break anything!

, If she puts it in plain sight, she'll notice it's gone- probably. But don't grab it when she's writing and left the room. You can take a peek, instead- just make sure she doesn't see! Follow step 3.
 Lock it- or at least close it. When you hear someone coming, make sure you hide it (if you don't have a lock). That way, they can't bother you looking for it!

, You're in luck if she falls asleep early. If course, if she's away, it doesn't matter what time you read it!

, This will tell her- if she already looked there- that it was put back. Put it somewhere else in her room like she misplaced it.
 But remember- if she doesn't tell about it she might not say she noticed it was missing.
 If you lie differently, remember the way you did and when she asks you again, lying or not, act the same way.
 Going into lying again. After it happens, just act normal. Act like it didn't.
