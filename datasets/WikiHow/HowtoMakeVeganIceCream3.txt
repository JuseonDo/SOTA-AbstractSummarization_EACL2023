 Cutting the bananas into slices will make it easier to blend them later on, so it doesn't have to be exact. 2- to 3-inch (5.8 to 7.62 centimeters) thick slices will be enough., This will give you softer ice cream in the end., This will allow the bananas to soften up a little, and make it easier to blend them.During this time, you can set up your food processor with a metal blade.
 From time to time, you will want to open up the food processor, and push down on the banana pieces with a spatula so that they don't collect on the sides. Don't worry if the bananas start to form crumbs; keep pulsing and stirring them until they are smooth.It is possible to do this in a blender, but the bananas will be more likely to clump up then.Hold off on adding the chocolate chips, if you are using them; you will add them later on.
 Try to find vegan chocolate chips, if you can. You can also use baking chocolate chips; they are made from cocoa and a little bitter, but they do not contain any dairy.
 You can use an empty ice cream container or even a plastic box with a lid. If you want to make individual servings, scoop the mixture into a greased muffin tin., The ice cream is perfectly edible sooner, but freezing it will give it that ice cream texture and allow it to hold its shape longer.
 You can serve the ice cream plain, or you can add goodies to it, such as more chocolate chips, crumbles nuts, strawberries, etc.


If you froze the ice cream in a muffin tin, simply pop the ice cream "muffins" out and serve them. You can store the rest in between sheets of parchment paper in your freezer.
