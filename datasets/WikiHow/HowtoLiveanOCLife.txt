 Don't rush your food, chew properly to ensure avoiding unhealthy choking.;
, Go for skinny jeans, pumps, heels, ankle boots, leggings, tights, minis, knee length skirts, day dresses, waistcoats, sweater dresses, long boots, rock tees, jackets. Wear other clothes too, you only have to wear some stylish clothes, all your outfits and garments don't have to be stylish, just some.
 Marissa and Summer wear a lot of designer pieces mixed with vintage pieces. Add them to whatever you like, your room, your luggage, you pets or even your outfits.
 Buy them and hang them in your wardrobe. You don't have to wear them, or even go to a dance in them. The important step is buying them, that's what is living the OC life, buying the dresses.
 Wear natural makeup (or go for strong eyes/lips if you're going out to an event) and vary your hair styles. If you're a redhead you might want to dye your hair blonde/brown because none of the teen characters, except Lindsay, have red hair. Paint your nails, preferably in deep red or black and get weekly manicures and pedicures. Have a weekly facial and massage. Pluck your eyebrows and wear perfectly applied fake tan. If your hair colour is a little dull then brighten it up with highlights.
,,, Spread around news about how good the band is! Try to get to know the members.
 Give any party you hold a theme and talk about it over the internet so the word goes around.
