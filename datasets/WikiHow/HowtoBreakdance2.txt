 This is the portion of the dance that you will complete standing up before you hit the ground and start stepping and spinning.
 You want to be light on your feet and be able to quickly change directions and bounce up and down.
 Stay light on your feet while you perform the crossover move. You don't have to use your left leg first, you just need to make sure that you are alternating feet each time you cross over.
 When in a resting position, your legs will be parallel and your feet ready to change directions.
 Again, be sure to remain on your toes as you do so.
 The key is to go with the rhythm of the music as you top rock, so each time you practice, the speed at which you top rock will depend on the beat of the song. Try to follow the rhythm of the baseline or the snare line.
 These simple movements complete the toprock.
 Once you've gotten the basic footwork down, you can let your hands swing with your body, but don't overdo it. Loosen up your arms and let them follow your feet.









When you step forward, you can allow your arms to swing back behind you, and as you hop back to a resting position, let them swing back to the front of your body.
The arm movements are really up to you, so groove to the music and let your body express itself.
Practice in a mirror to check that you are not flailing your arms too much.
