, This is key.
 Knowing how much time is left on the clock allows you to better know when to aggressively go for a block attempt and when to stay grounded.
If there is enough time and your player is dribbling, you may attempt a steal, but use caution! A foul, unless you have one to give, is not a good idea in this situation. Try to swipe at the ball as it hits his hand and is headed back towards the floor. One of the best times to try to go for a steal is when the offensive player is crossing over. You could also miss the steal completely, and he would be able to get by you easily. Also notice the player's attention, if it's on you or his team.
 Too close and you're more prone to be driven on, too far and the offensive player could just pull up for a shot.
 For example, if the player is left-handed, put up your right hand, right-handed, left hand.
You do not always have to go for the block while playing perimeter defense, especially when your unsure if they are really shooting. Sometimes it is better to just close out on the shooter and give he or she the least amount of room possible to get off the shot without fouling. This is done by stepping up to them when shoot and getting as tall as possible, with your hands straight up or you can use your hands to cover the shooters eyes.
