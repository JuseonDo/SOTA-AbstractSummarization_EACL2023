 Do not join it up as a circle just yet though, as the Slinky needs to be added first.
 Now it's time to seal the wire loop at the top, leaving a long piece of wire to turn into a hook at the top. Wind the wire around the joined section several times, to ensure that it is held firmly in place. For the remaining long piece, twist into a hook shape for hanging.
 Take one end of the Slinky and free a length from it. Wind this around the join several times, to hold it firmly in place.
 As with the first join, pill a little length from the other end of the Slinky and wind this around the join. When hanging, the Slinky will now fall evenly around the wire loop, held firmly in place at the wire loop's join point.
 Peanuts are ideal for this design; simply stuff them in until the Slinky can hold no more.


If any parts of the Slinky bulge open too widely and let out too much food, use small gauge wire to attach the Slinky to the wire loop at even points, to prevent the Slinky shape from distorting.
 This is optional, especially if you can't be sure that the sealant is safe, but it will help the Slinky to cope with the elements.


Look for food-safe finishes (FDA approved).
 It's now ready for the birds to hang off it and pull the food out with their beaks.
