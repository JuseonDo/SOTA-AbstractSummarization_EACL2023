 It's not so much what clothes you wear, but how you wear them. However, never underestimate the value of a pair of leather pants. They were people too, and wore jeans and t-shirts. Piling on scarves and jewelry will add the glam touch, though.;
, Anything leather, shiny, sequined, or spandex will fit the look perfectly.
, To get hair this big, you need to learn how to tease it. You take a section of your hair, grab a brush, and brush it upwards onto itself. Tease a section, spray with hairspray, and repeat in a different spot.
, Repeat as many times as necessary. Curling your hair can work too, but the method above is a tried and true technique.
 It's your decision.
 It was over the top; don't hold back with the makeup, and don't be afraid to use unnatural colors.
 Also make sure to wear plenty of eyeliner, but not on your bottom eyelids.
, But for those of you who are new to it, it makes sense to give a little background on it. Glam metal originated on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in the 1980s. It's not really 'metal' in the sense that Black Sabbath is metal, it's more of a form of hard rock.
 Then you can get into glam metal. Some great glam metal bands are Motley Crue, Poison, Warrant, Ratt, Bon Jovi (early stuff though; anything after New Jersey isn't quite as 'glam'), and Cinderella.
, Be tough; stand up for yourself.
 Glam is just that- a fun indulgence.
