put your things correctly on their hooks and stands, clean out your locker if you have one.

 Start with your tack in the tack room/stable lounge, take it apart and polish it. Well cared for material is safe material., If something looks uncared for, gently encourage the person to do something about it, don't pressure them though., Give the floor a good dusting and sweeping.

Clean the lounge, too. In the lounge (if you are so lucky to have one) put everything away so it can be found easily and vacuum or sweep the floor.
