 You'll need wood for crafting in your mine, so try to keep it in log form, but planks are equally well. You'll need dirt to nerd pole out of holes and explore caves, as it's easy to break and not affected by gravity.;
, You don't need golden apples, but a stack or half a stack of meat, bread or baked potatoes are really necessary.
 You'll need an oven or two, a crafting bench, two chests and a bed.
 You'll need ladders to go up and down the mineshaft.
 Don't start your mine near a lava lake. try to avoid caves, unless you want to explore them on your way down.
 Never dig straight down. You can fall in a cave full of monsters or a pocket of lava.
 You'll find the most ores on layer 11, so it's logical to set up your base here.
 It doesn't have to be big, 5x5 and 2 high is big enough.
 It has to be around 20 blocks long.
 Leave 1-3 blocks between each tunnel.
, When you want to go up again, go to your base and use the ladders to get out using the mineshaft.
