to make it, separate the shorter part of the clip to make a wide enough base then pull up the lip part of the clip taking care that the lip looks down to the base, so the rocket can nestle easily on the launcher.you may have to shorten the stem of the matchstick for a proper hold.

by striking the three rocket heads, it should flare light it the same way the three stems did and with quick succession.

 To make the head of the rocket, take a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) wide strip of kitchen aluminum foil.Tear a rectangle by 2x3 centimeters.Then, make a fold for 0'5 centimeter (2.0 in) along both longer sides. Once this is completed, wrap the head of the match tightly.Twist the upper part of the match to get a quite cool pointed tip. The cool pointed tip should look similar to a cool looking rocket.


Take your thumbnail and strike the three matchsticks with your thumbnail. This way you can create a nice tripod. It is recommended that you keep the heads together and roll the foil over them tightly (3-4 times is enough). Follow the same procedure mentioned above and proceed as if you were creating a single head rocket.;
, During the first stages of creating a single head rocket, an adult should be around to help you and to supervise with the project should an accident occur when creating a single rocket head.
, It's great fun because it might topple down,and might not ignite or it could be a real success.
