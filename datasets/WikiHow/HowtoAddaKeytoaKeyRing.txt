 Most key rings are like springs, but some have clasps that open directly. The rest of this article is about the spring style key rings.
 If you have several keys on the ring already, you may want to place the key in a certain place in the sequence. Push the other keys to the side and work in the space where you want the new key. Also decide which way you'd like the key to point, with relation to the key ring and the other keys., You can jam a thumb or fingernail in, or you can use a slender object, such as a paper clip or screwdriver, to spare your nails.
 The key will hold the coils open.
