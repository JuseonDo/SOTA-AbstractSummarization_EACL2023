 One step should do it. You need enough room to build up enough momentum, but if you run then you will probably slip.;
, Only swan-dive in the deepest end reachable, as the swan-dive will take you very deep very quickly.
 Your toes should be just hanging over the edge of the pool. Your other leg can be next to it or several inches behind, it depends on your preferences.
 This is essential for later.
 Be sure to push slightly up, too. Snap your legs together tightly and lean forward when you do. Your body should be slightly bent.
 Do this quickly, as time is tight.
 If possible, do this as you push off from the edge.
 You should enter the water smoothly with little splashing.
 This is essential, as nobody can perfectly execute a swan-dive first-time.
