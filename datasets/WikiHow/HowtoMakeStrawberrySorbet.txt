 Stir the mixture often, and be careful not to let it scorch. This will make the simple syrup, which you will use to sweeten the sorbet with.;
, During this time, you can prepare the strawberries by rinsing them and hulling them.
 Fresh strawberries would be the best, but if you can't find any, you can use frozen ones instead. Be sure to let them thaw first, however., Use the back of a spoon to get as much pulp out as possible, and discard the seeds. At this point, you can also add the optional ingredients, such as vanilla extract and Grand Marnier (or other liquor).Straining the mixture will get rid of the strawberry seeds and give you a smoother texture. If you don't care about the seeds, then you can leave the puree in the blender, and simply add the syrup, lemon juice, and other ingredients to it.
 At this point, give the mixture a taste; it will give you an idea of what your sorbet will taste like when it is frozen. If the mixture is not sweet enough, add a little bit more sugar. If the mixture is too sweet, add a little bit more water or lemon juice. After making the adjustment, pulse the mixture one last time. , You can freeze it using an ice cream maker or a pan and freezer.
 When you are done, transfer the sorbet to the freezer for 2 to 3 hours so that it can firm up.If you do not have an ice cream maker, then you can freeze the mixture in your freezer. Read on to learn how.
 Try to use a stainless steel pan if you can; the sorbet will freeze faster. Use a spatula to spread the mixture evenly over the pan.
 Make sure that the pan is resting on a flat surface so that the mixture doesn't spill.
 This will make it easier to blend later on. Don't worry if it looks too smooth when you take it out; you will be freezing it again after you blend it.
 This will break up any ice crystals and make the sorbet light and fluffy.
 After this, the sorbet is ready to serve.If the sorbet is too firm, let it thaw a little first. It will last up to 1 week in the freezer.
