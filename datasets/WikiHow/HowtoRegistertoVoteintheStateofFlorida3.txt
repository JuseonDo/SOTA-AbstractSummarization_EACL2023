 Below you will find a list of information you can change, as well as requests you can make for new cards.
 If you move to a different address, you'll need to provide information so that the change can be noted.


If moving to a different address within the same county, contact you Supervisor of Elections and alert them of your new address. You can do this in person, by phone, or by written application, e.g. filling out the Florida Voter Registration Application.When doing so, provide your date of birth.
If moving to a different address outside of the county, fill out the Florida Voter Registration Application with your new address.
 Notify the state of Florida of any change in party affiliation by filling out a voter registration application. This application must include either your date of birth or your voter registration number as proof of identity.
 If you change your name, because of marriage or gender reassignment surgery, for example, notify the state of Florida by filling out a voter registration application.
 Since a county official checks the accuracy of the signature in your ballot against the signature on file, having an up-to-date signature is very important.
