 This look will crease easily if you don't apply a primer, so don't skip this step. Use your fingers to sweep the product over your entire eyelid.


Urban Decay's Primer Potion is a great option for eye primer.
For a more affordable product, try elf's Essential Eyelid Primer.;
, Using a shading brush, apply the shadow generously over your lid and up to the crease. Make sure that this color looks opaque and clean. You can also use an eyeshadow base for this step.


Nyx Cosmetic's Eyeshadow base in white works well for this look.
Any bright white eyeshadow is fine as long as it is matte.
 Make this line as clean and thin as possible. This part may take practice, but if you mess up, just use a q-tip dipped in makeup remover to fix it. You could also use a gel eyeliner for this part.


Mac's Carbon is a great black eyeshadow.
 Don't wing it out at the end; just let it follow the downward curve of your lashline.


Bobbi Brown's gel liner gives a smooth line and is easy to apply.
Rimmel London's Professional Liquid Eyeliner looks great with mod makeup.
 Do not go into the waterline for this part.
 Be generous with this product so that it is a bright white color.


Nyx Cosmetic's Retractable Eyeliner in white is great for the waterline.
 Use a black eyeliner to trace small lines on the outer part of your eye.



Benefit's They're Real Mascara gives a thick, full look.
L'Oreal's Miss Manga is perfect for the mod look.
 Squeeze a bit of lash glue onto the band and then wait about twenty seconds for the glue to get tacky. Then, using tweezers or your fingers, place them onto your lashline and secure them gently.


Eye lashes have a large range of styles.
