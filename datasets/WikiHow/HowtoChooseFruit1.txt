 Fruit that comes out of season comes from farther away, and generally lacks the flavor of fruit in season.
 The smell, touch and look of the fruit are all important in determining whether you get ripe, delicious fruit or sour, unripe or bland fruit.
 The stem is the natural clock of when the fruit was picked. Green stem with ripe fruit= A winner; Green stem with very hard fruit = Picked early and will possibly become mealy when ripened; Shriveled dry stem = Picked long ago lacking flavor and texture of fresh fruit.
 The less popular fruits may not be in season which can mean that they will not be in the store at that time.
 If you find any do not take it.
 For example, don't take a green strawberry.
, Some fruits have a "ripe" odor, like cantaloupe and honeydew melons. Some fruit may have a sour odor if they are beginning to spoil.
 Firm fruits like apples and pears should feel firm, but peaches, plums, and other "soft" fleshed fruits should feel slightly soft. If you test it this way, do so carefully as not to damage the fruit.
 The old saying, "One rotten apple will spoil the whole lot," is often true, and you will seldom find a large bag of fruit without at least some damaged fruit in it.
 If it's heavy for its size, then you have successfully found yourself a good piece of fruit!
