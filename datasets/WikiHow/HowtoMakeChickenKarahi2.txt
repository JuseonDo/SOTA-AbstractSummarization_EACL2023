 The onion brings a savory sweetness to the dish. Simply cook the onion in the hot oil until it is translucent. This means it is more or less see-through.
 This is a continuation of the Northern Indian variation of the dish. Add the green pepper with the tomatoes so they cook in the liquid but still have some crunch., This step isn't necessary, but some people prefer a completely smooth sauce for their chicken karahi. If so, get blending, but know that the step isn't entirely necessary.


For a perfectly smooth sauce, which some restaurants insist on, you can remove the chicken right as the sauce finishes up. Put all of the liquid in a blender and blend until you have a perfectly smooth sauce, then add the chicken back in and serve.
 This leads to a creamier, slightly less intense dish. Some recipes require a form of cream, but this is likely a later ingredient brought in by Indian and Western cooks, as it resembles tikka masala. Add the cream with the tomatoes, stirring the liquids together until smooth and blended, then cook like normal.


For a slightly tangy taste, you could also use a 1/2 cup of plain yogurt., As long as you cut it into bite-sized, quick-cooking pieces you'll be perfect. Cook it just like you would normally cook the chicken.
