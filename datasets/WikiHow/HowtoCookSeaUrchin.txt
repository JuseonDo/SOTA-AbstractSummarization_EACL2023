 If you have a Japanese or Korean market, you might be able to find them there. Select fresh specimens that have stiff, rigid spines and a closed opening on the underside. Store them in the refrigerator underneath a damp towel until you are ready to cook them.;
, Scissors from a men's grooming kit work well, or you can use regular kitchen shears if you cannot find anything else. Wash the scissors with hot, soapy water before using them on any food product.
 A grapefruit spoon works well. Rinse the pieces quickly under cold water, and place them in a bowl with the onion, sherry, lemon juice, cilantro and 1 T. olive oil. Allow to marinate for 20 to 30 minutes.
 When the grill is heated to medium, toast the bread on both sides.
