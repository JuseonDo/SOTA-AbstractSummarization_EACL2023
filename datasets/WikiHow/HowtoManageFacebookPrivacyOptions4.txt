 If you're unsure about what your profile looks like to a certain one of your friends, you can check it out by clicking "View As..." on the right hand side of your profile.
 Hit enter. You will then be able to view your profile exactly as that person views it. Make notes of things you want to change.
 This will take you back to your regular view of your profile. Alternatively, you can type in another name to see how someone else sees your profile.
