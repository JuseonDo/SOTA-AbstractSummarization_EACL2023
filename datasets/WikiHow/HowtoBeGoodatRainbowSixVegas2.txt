@summary
be stealthy whenever you can, use your silencer, keep your team on 'infiltrate' and set up ambushes and quick kills.

@summary
if your silencer is on then the tangos (terrorist) can't hear you unless your bullet hits something next to you.

@summary
in order to set up ambushes, you need to quietly approach 2 or more tangos with silencers on or off (your choice, i prefer silencer because of the stealth) tell your team to take cover and hold fire then you go around the tangos if possible, if not just stay with your team.

@summary
stealth kills this works with 1-4 enemies with 3 being kind of risky and 1 being safer.

@summary
in some situations you'll be forced into big battles with guns blazing.

@summary
cqb situations, in close quarters have silencers off (gives your weapon more damage and penetration)use smoke and thermal.

@summary
the explosives, smoke grenades etc.

, use that to your advantage by killing enemies near each other. NOTE doing this will work if no one sees you or the dead tangos.
 then target the leader/s (if more than two) remember you can only tag two tangos at time.
 with 1 tango, tell your team to stay back and take cover near the enemy then quickly pop out for a quick kill. for 2 tangos, tag each of them and tell your team to open fire to kill both of them instantly. with 3 tangos, target two of them and put your cross hair on the non tagged one, then as soon as you tell your team to open fire kill your tango and if possible kill any other tango they might have missed. this can also be done with 4 but you have to make sure all 4 tangos are killed quick. remember silencers, speed and team work, your guys are accurate.
 in order to survive take cover. and keep control of your team. tag the leaders (the ones with the red hats) if you kill them the rest of the tangos will be confused and not flank and keep their order giving you the advantage of flanking. covering fire works, especially when you don't have your silencer on, giving you the advantage of flanking or sniping them.
 when you pop out of cover and shoot but miss the enemy will shoot back out of cover, get to know his pattern and when he pops out next scoot over or when at a corner pop out up or side. then pop out of a new area and take him out, this tactic is seen in real life and in paintball.
 have good range, use them wisely because you only get a few of them.
