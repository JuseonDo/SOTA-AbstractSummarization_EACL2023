, There are two options for plywood use:


a) Cut to where it looks like a skateboard ramp to put around the edges to have some what of a "hard" wrestling ring.
b) Lay the pieces of plywood across the trampoline until you can get it to where it looks like a square. (preferred way)

, There is a variety of ways to keep the boards together:


Put small 2 x 4's on the bottom of the trampoline and nail through the trampoline.
Put the 2 x 4's on each outside part of the plywood were there is a gap and lay the board across the plywood and nail that to it.
,
Dig 4 holes about 2 feet (0.6 m). deep, so you should have 2 feet (0.6 m). underground, 1.5 on the side of the ring, and 4.5 feet (1.4 m) for ring ropes, which equals 8 feet (2.4 m).
 Be sure to wrap the cable around the turnbuckle. You can spray paint the ropes any color, black looks the best! For ropes, buy 12 turnbuckles, and you will need 6 cable stoppers which are 40 cents apiece.
