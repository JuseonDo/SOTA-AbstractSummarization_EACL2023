 One way to blow into the instrument is to say the word "Too". Then whisper the word "Too".;
, Lightly blow into the instrument. If you blow too hard you A. can't hear it or B. Makes a really loud annoying sound. Plus it's a waste of breath.
 Lightly. Or you can hear the T so loud it will ruin the sound of the music. Or, you can just blow regularly into the instrument but remember to keep it light.
 You can't play any notes without your thumb behind there except for High D. Here is how to play all of the notes on a precorder:


High D No holes covered. Just put your thumb in the bump area on the side with the C hole and then you can hold the sides with your other hands.






High C One hole covered. Just cover the one hole on the other side.






B Cover the hole on the other side and the first hole on the side with lots of holes.






A Same way you play B, with another finger on the hole below B.






G Cover the High C and the first three holes.






F Cover the High C and four holes.






E Cover the High C and five holes.






D Cover the High C and all holes covered except the one on the very bottom.






Low C Cover all the holes including the High C hole.
