 While you may not want to sink that much money into it, it's a good idea to know what you would like to have. That being said, be prepared to compromise. When buying used, you have to settle for what's out there.;
, There are many sites out there that carry outdated manuals for a lot of products.
 Too much power can ruin your whole day (and your camera).
 Just because they SAID it goes on a Nikon, doesn't mean that it does. Do further research to verify what they say.
 This will help you determine the strength of the flash.
, Is it yellow? It should be clear.
 Make sure that the cover is there, is secure and that there is no corrosion.
 Most especially, damage that could affect the way it would operate and its efficiency.
 This way, you can make sure it works and get any question you have, answered. If not, like buying it online, make sure there is a return policy.
 Sometimes, it will only work at some of its settings.
