in order to ensure the curls last a long time, do not use as much shampoo or conditioner during your regular washes.

 Conditioner straightens and smooths the hair, making it very difficult to curl. The natural oils in your hair will also help keep curls lasting a long time.


Do not wash your hair the day or two before you plan to curl.
