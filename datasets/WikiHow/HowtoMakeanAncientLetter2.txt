 Write whatever you need on a piece of blank paper. Add an old date.
 The transparency will allow you to see the depth of the color and you can add more tea if wished.
 If it doesn't seem dark enough, add more.
 Pour it into a pan.
 Do not dip it in completely. Instead, use a paintbrush to brush on texture. Dip in the tea tray and paint over the paper.
 When dried, the letter is ready for use.


Touch-ups can be made using the paintbrush.
