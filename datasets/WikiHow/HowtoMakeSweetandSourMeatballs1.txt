 Beat the egg enough so that the yolk breaks and mixes in with the white. Make sure that the bowl is big enough to hold the rest of your ingredients for the meatballs.;
, You can use as much Worcestershire sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper as you'd like. Try not to overdo it, however; a pinch or dash of each ingredient would be plenty. Stir everything with a rubber spatula until all of the ingredients are evenly combined.


Do not add the oil; you will be using it for frying.
 A great way to ensure that each meatball is getting the same amount is to measure out the mixture with a spoon. Roll the mixture into a ball between the palms of your hands.
 Pour 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of vegetable oil into a large skillet, and let it heat up over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the meatballs, and fry them until they turn golden-brown.Don't worry if they aren't cooked through; you will continue cooking them in the sauce later on.
 During this time, you can start preparing the sauce.
 Pour 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of vegetable oil into a medium-sized saucepan and let it heat up over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the onion, and let it cook until it turns soft. Stir it occasionally with a spatula to prevent burning.
 Whisk the ingredients together until everything is mixed, then let them simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.During this time, the sauce will start to thicken.
 Give the meatballs a stir once you add them in so that they get coated evenly with the sauce. Then, raise the heat back to medium, and let the meatballs cook for 1 hour., They taste great paired with white or brown rice.
