When a pop-up appears, select 'Connect as USB mass storage' / 'Media device' (depending on what your device lists out) to enable you to transfer files from PC to phone and vice versa.
If a pop up doesn't appear, draw your notifications up and select from there - for example, the notification you get if your PC successfully installs your Android device.;
,,,, This folder has the letter A in blue and bold attached to it.
 Please note that you might not be able to copy from local disk (C:) directly to phone storage so, what you'll have to do is to copy from local disk (C:) to local disk (D:) or a flash drive then, from that location to your phone storage.
,, You can now open WPS Office on your mobile and check your fonts out.
