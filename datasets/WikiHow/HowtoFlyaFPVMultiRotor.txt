,, Making sure that what you are doing is legal is essential. The rules vary region by region, so check your local drone/quad-copter regulations., Most people use 2.4ghz for control of the multi-rotor and so the only available legal frequency in the UK is 5.8ghz. It has a restriction though on power. The maximum for the TX is 25mw. This is ok if you have decent clover leaf antennas., Don't fly within five miles of an airport or near radio masts or power lines. Don't fly within 50 meters (160Â ft) of any object or person that you don't have direct control over., This requires a license.

There are too many regulations to list, do a quick Google. The CAA govern all of this in the UK.
There are different regulation for different parts of the country as well. Check with the local council about what you are doing.


Note: Do not attempt to fly FPV without extensive knowledge of flying.
