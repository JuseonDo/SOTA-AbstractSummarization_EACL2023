, Only carry on items such as laptops, cell phones, iPods, and whatever you need to keep you from getting bored during your flight

, Now is also the time to get a drink or something to eat so you are not hungry or thirsty onboard

, Wear shoes that are easy to remove. DO NOT wear jewelry and if you can, avoid wearing a belt.
 This air vent blows recirculated air directly into your face towards your eyes mouth and nose. Leaving this on is the fastest way to get sick while flying. Inform the people sitting next to you of this and kindly ask if they would turn theirs off as well.
 Everyone else on the plane wants to get off as well, and should move rather quickly especially with the flight attendants ushering them out. Take your time, make sure you collect all your carry on items, and calmly head towards the exit

, If you are an unaccompanied minor IMMEDIATELY go to the help desk and ask for someone to take you to your connecting flight. They will be willing to help you, and you will be able to relax before boarding again instead of searching for your gate.
: Keep in mind where you are going and why you are flying. Maybe on an important business trip or adventure? Vacation or visiting friends/family? Remembering why you are doing this will keep your stress levels low and make the flight and airport hassle worth it!
