 You can do this by double clicking on the pink heart icon on your doc. If you do not have Skitch on your doc, simply click the same icon in your applications folder.
 Do not minimize this window. Simply click on the Skitch icon to bring the program to the front of the screen., This will make the Skitch screen shrink, and leave you with a set of capture crosshairs.
 Place the crosshairs at the farthest corner of the section you wish to capture. Then hold the mouse button down (if your mouse has two buttons, then hold the left button) and drag the crosshairs to the opposite end of the section you wish to capture. When you get to the end release the button.
 You have just taken your first screen shot.


Publish it to Skitch.com by clicking "share" in the lower right corner of the screen. By going to the Skitch website, Skitch will provide you embed codes for HTML, forums, Twitter, Facebook and other publishing platforms.
