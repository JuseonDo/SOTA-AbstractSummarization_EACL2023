, Popular decks can be based on character decks from anime and manga; warrior decks are also popular. You should be informed about the meta decks right now, know their strategies and make a deck to counter the popular ones.], Even if you don't think it would be good, it might work with something you find later.
, Try to have more effect monsters than normal monsters. All but 2 or 3 of these cards should be level 4 or lower. Add some flip effect monster to add an element of surprise to your dueling. I like to include two level 5-6 monsters and one level 7+ monster. If you are going to add a god card or a similar 3 tribute monster you may want to consider not having any other tribute monsters.
 you want about half of these to be the staples I discussed earlier, and the rest cards to aid your deck in particular. Try to include about 13 spells and 7 traps, or something close to that ratio.
 loading down your deck with too many cards is your number one ticket to being a sucky duelist.
 Even if it's super hard to fusion or synchro summon a monster, you never know what you'll draw.
 There's nothing worse than summoning your best monster and being forced to swap it out with your opponent's Quillbolt Hedgehog.
 This is another good way to win, because your opponent loses if their deck runs out of cards.
 De-Synchro and De-Fusion are great to use on your opponent, but what could you do if you played them on your own monsters? There's no better way to blow away an opponent than by surprising them with amazing strategy.
 There's always room for improvement.
