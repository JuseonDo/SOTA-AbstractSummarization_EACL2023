 How do I want to feel? What do I want to experience?;
,, Just be yourself for a few seconds.
 Whatever it is, accept the feeling by either hugging yourself while feeling it or mentally wrapping your arms around the emotion, as if it were a ball of light.
, Look at the tree tops. Notice how the breeze or wind moves them and if they have any birds in them. See the clouds and note the direction and speed of the wind. Touch something in the natural world, like a smooth stone or a plant. Notice its texture and temperature.
 Keep a sense of responsible awareness, but go ahead and feel the wonder of everything; try fun things like moving your body to mimic the poses the kid is striking, and let her or him in on it by pointing out stuff to laugh about together.
 Write about anything. Save what you wrote and read it later. You'll enjoy it and gain insights into yourself.
 Plan a picnic if possible. Invite all ages of your friends and families!

, Consider the differences and similarities between what is assumed and demanded by the post-modern world around you and what is necessary and desirable to you.
