 If it's something positive, like good grades or a good sense of fashion, you will want to go for the same thing. But if they're popular because they smoke or sleep around, think twice. Do you really want to put your safety at risk for the sake of a little attention?;
, What do they do that you could do yourself?

, Make a list of things you like about yourself, and play up those. If you have any bad habits, get ready to break them.
 Remember, the goal is not to turn yourself into somebody else, it's to make yourself into the best you that you can be.
 Put some of their comments into action (but use common sense; not everything they suggest will be a good idea!)

, (Try to be specific about one part of her awesomeness, like: "Could you tell me where you got that skirt?" or "What's your secret for doing well in math?") Listen. You might actually learn something.
 Everybody is drawn to people who are friendly and cheerful. Always look for the best in other people, and practice really admiring them for who they are. They will return the favor.
 You might want to give them a compliment, too, if you feel like it.
 Invite them somewhere with you and your friends, or suggest that you should work on homework together. They will love you for it.
 Learn how to get along with people who may be different from you. This skill will serve you well, long after you have left school.
 Performance skills (singing, dancing, playing an instrument, acting) are always good. If you like to write or draw, enter some contests. Join a sports team.
 Remember people like to talk to you and not the caterpillar that is resting on your upper lip.
