 While the free version of uTorrent displays ads by default, you can disable these ads in the Preferences menu.


uTorrent ads ensure that the developer can provide a free version of the program without losing money. If you like uTorrent and want to thank the developers, you may consider paying $4.95 USD to upgrade to the ad-free version.;
,, “Advanced” is at the bottom of the list.
 You can find this option in one of two ways:


Type gui.show_plus_upsell into the Filter box and select it from the search results.Scroll down the list until you find it. The list is in alphabetical order, so it shouldn’t be too difficult.
 When you clicked “gui.show_plus_upsell”, two radio buttons labeled with “True” and “False” appeared beneath the Advanced Options box. Clicking the button next to “False” will disable the ad at the bottom left corner of uTorrent.
 Switching this option to false disables the banner ad at the top of the torrent list.



offers.left_rail_offer_enabled
offers.sponsored_torrent_offer_enabled
gui.show_notorrents_node
offers.content_offer_autoexec
bt.enable_pulse

,


Note that if you did not find one (or more) of the above options in Advanced Options, don’t panic—uTorrent sometimes changes the names of these options. Return to the Advanced Options screen and type “offer” into the “Filter” box. Now, change all of those currently set to “True” to “False”., To make sure all of your changes take effect, restart uTorrent.
