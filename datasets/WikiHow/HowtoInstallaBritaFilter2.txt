 Your filtration system should come with two adaptors to fit most kitchen sinks. It is an exterior filter that can be easily removed and replaced when the filter is no longer effective.
 The Brita filter will need to screw onto the exterior threads on the tap. If your sink tap has interior threads, screw on one of the adaptors before you install the system.
 Align the collar with the faucet threads. Turn the attachment carefully to connect the filter system to the faucet.
 Test for leaks by turning on the cold water.
 Flush the system for five minutes. It will activate the filter and remove carbon dust.
 The green light will indicate the filter is still good. The red light indicates you should change the system.
