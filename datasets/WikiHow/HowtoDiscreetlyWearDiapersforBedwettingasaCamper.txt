 Camp Kirk and Camp Brandon are two camps that have staff equipped to deal with these problems. If you do a Google search you may be able to come up with others.;
, The parents should check with the staff and ask them what type of arrangements are made for youth that wet the bed and may have to wear diapers to bed.
 The children may feel intimidated if you tell them out in the open when others are around. If you take them aside into an enclosed room and tell them, they might not be as intimidated as if you didn't tell them at all.
 Make sure they can decipher a wet diaper from a dirty diaper, and also from sweaty-wet diaper to completely unused.



Changing a cloth diaper isn't feasible for a child of any age to complete successfully,, especially alone at night. Besides the smell of urine from the bedwetter's diaper, the fact that most disposables can hold a bit more fluid, can help make your child believe they can hold onto their wet diaper further until morning (and they can continue peeing in it) and thereby helping alleviate the uncomfortable feeling of having to be seen walking past to head to change it in separate secluded area.
, Incontinence forums are a good place to get suggestions about the many issues surrounding incontinence at camp and how to be discreet about dealing with the problem.
 Not only should they contain at least one or more packs of diapers, they should also contain ways to not show off that they are holding onto other packages of diapers. Pack them into the bag in layers. Cover them in plastic bags (with the plastic bag bottom showing outwards towards the other kids (should the other kids decide they'd like to look into the bag when the bedwetting child isn't looking)).
