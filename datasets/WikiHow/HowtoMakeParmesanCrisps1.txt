 You can also use a silicone baking sheet instead., Try to use coarsely-grated Parmesan cheese; it will look more like shredded Parmesan. Avoid using the powdery, finely-grated Parmesan cheese. It will melt, but it won't create that pretty, lacey design., Gently press the back of a spoon against the mound, and swirl it around until the cheese flattens and spreads. Be careful not to great an indentation; you want it to be the same thickness all around.Don't worry if you see some gaps in your cheese. The cheese will melt together, and create a pretty, lacy design.
 Each mound needs to be about 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 centimeters) apart.You will have enough cheese to make about 8 to 10 such mounds.
 This is completely optional, but many people find that it gives the crisps extra flavor. If black pepper does not suit your fancy, consider using some of these other tasty seasonings:Cayenne
Finely chopped basil, rosemary, or thyme
Garlic powder
Smoked paprika

, The crisps are ready when they turn golden.If the crisps are not crunchy or golden enough for you, back them for 1 to 3 minutes more.,
