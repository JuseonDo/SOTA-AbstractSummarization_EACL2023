 Open up a window or turn a fan on so that you have good ventilation. Make sure that the oven rack is in the bottom portion of the oven., Choose a bowl that is about 8½ to 9 inches (21.59 to 22.86 centimeters) wide.Place it upside down onto a large baking sheet. If you'd like to further protect your baking sheet, cover it with aluminum foil or parchment paper first.

You can also use cans, mugs, or even metal colanders, Make sure that the record is centered, and that the side you want to be on the inside is facing down.Clean the record first if it is dirty., This should take about 3 to 5 minutes, but it would take up to 8 or 10 minutes. Keep an eye on your record, however, so that it does not melt. Once it starts to warp, you are ready for the next step.
 Use a pair of oven mitts to pull the entire baking sheet out of the oven. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface.
 You may be able to do this with your bare hands, but you will need to be careful so that you don't burn yourself on the base bowl or the baking sheet. You can also shape the bowl using a metal spoon or spatula instead.


The record will start to cool and harden in about 20 to 30 seconds, so work quickly!Alternatively, you can set the record into a smaller bowl (right-side-up) first, then shape it that way., After about 10 to 15 minutes, the record should be rigid again, and cool to the touch. Once that happens, you can lift it off of the base bowl, and use it to store non-food items, such as remotes, knick-knacks, or accessories.
