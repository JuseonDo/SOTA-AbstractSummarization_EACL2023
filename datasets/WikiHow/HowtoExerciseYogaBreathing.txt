 Relax your body, empty your mind and stay aware of your breath.;
, With Yoga Breathing we take the oxygen into the solar plexus. We are conscious of our breath and we take deep breaths, through the nose. This type of breathing strengthens the body and increases the supply of oxygen to the brain. Breath-in pushing the air into your stomach, feeling the stomach expand. The oxygen goes into the lowest part of your lungs, then the middle, and then the top. Your chest and abdomen will expand. Breathing slowly and deeply brings oxygen to the lowest part of your lungs and exercises your diaphragm. During an inhalation, your diaphragm will move downwards.
 Follow your breath out of your body, empty your stomach first, lower lungs, followed by upper lungs. Allow your shoulders to completely relax. During an exhalation, your diaphragm moves up, compressing the lungs and pushing air out.
, The yogic breathing teaches us to breathe through the nose, to lengthen our exhalation, increasing our physical and mental health. Practice and this will become your normal breathing, requiring no particular effort.
