 Take home just a little each day, so your load will be lighter.;
, However, if you start cleaning it a week early you probably won't need them. Try to find ones that have handles but are also sturdy. If you have a couple of canvas tote bags, use them.
 Leave or return any textbooks that belong to the school, and return any library books.
 You can recycle your notes or store them at home if you think you will need them to study or review for next year.
 Leave one binder or folder with current stuff if you need it for the remaining days of school.
 Leave enough loose-leaf paper and notebooks for the remaining days.
, By the last day of school all you should really need to take home is a few notebooks and a folder or two, but leave some time to clear out any remaining junk. Be nice to whoever will use your locker next year and bring some cleaning materials so that you can clean your locker. If you forget, at least use a damp paper towel from the restroom to wipe the dust and fuzz out of the bottom.
