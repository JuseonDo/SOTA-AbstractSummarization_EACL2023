 Try to pick somewhere that you don't think is noticeable; definitely not the front or near a teachers desk.If you can bury yourself away in a corner or bunched in the middle, you're less likely to be sharply observed by teachers. However, try not to sit with your friends, teachers might observe because they're suspicious.;
, Don't think you can just put your feet up and begin daydreaming; take your things out, open your book to a new page and have a pen/calculator/whatever is required for the lesson. This way the teacher will think you're organized and working.
 This will give the impression that you actually know what's going on, and are concentrating.
 This way, if your teacher happens to walk past, they won't just see a bunch of doodles or blank pages, but work.
 Teachers seem to think that you are taking notes if they see you writing. If you are in a back or middle row, then they will not see what you are really doing.
 Make sure you have a book in front of you. From the teachers point of view, it will look like you're reading.
 It'll look like you're actually reading, when you're texting or playing!
