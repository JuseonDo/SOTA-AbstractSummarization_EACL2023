 Follow the above instructions about boiling spinach.
 Place the leaves on top of clean paper towels and place a separate layer of paper towels over the spinach. Pat the leaves dry until they no longer appear damp.
 Coarsely chop the spinach using a sharp, smooth-bladed knife.









Alternatively, you may also use kitchen shears to cut the leaves into coarsely shredded pieces.
 Heat the butter over medium to medium-high heat until it melts and coats the bottom of the skillet.
 Cook the onion and the garlic, in butter, for about 5 minutes, allowing the ingredients to release a strong aroma and to caramelize.
 Stir the whipping cream into the onions and garlic.
 Stir and cook, uncovered, until the mixture begins to boil and thicken.
 Mix it into the cream, allowing the cream mixture to thoroughly coat the leaves. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the contents of the skillet to simmer, still uncovered, for an additional 2 minutes. The contents should appear even thicker.
