 You will need 1-3 medium potatoes per person.;
,, It is best to use either peanut oil or a blended oil, which is usually a mix of canola and soybean oil. Set the stove on medium-high heat. If your stove has number settings, set it to 8.
 You can make the slices as thick or thin as you want, just make sure they are all about the same thickness.
 You can test the oil by putting a single fry in there. If it starts cooking immediately, and quickly, the oil is ready.
 Do not burn them, as they will taste absolutely disgusting!








, Add salt (optional) while still hot to keep the flavor in. Set them on the counter or an area with room temperature to cool. If you attempt to eat the French fries while they're still hot, you will burn your tongue!








, You can eat your French fries with ketchup, mayonnaise, BBQ sauce, French fry dip, salt and pepper, etc.
