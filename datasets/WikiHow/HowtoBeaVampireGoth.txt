, You can research on Google to look the cut or you can just dye your hair black or dark red. You can add color streaks, like black,red or other colors resembling vampires. Remember that vampire goths aren't the most colorful goth type, they concentrate on red and black, and just a little bit of white. Keep your hair sleek and shining.
 You guys can just draw on some eyeliner and maybe add fangs. For girls; On all vampire-stuff, the lips are very important. Just some eyeliner, some mascara on your eyes, and blood red or bright red lipstick. Some vampire goths use tooth caps for an everyday look. Consider wearing lenses. Don't forget the really pale complexion!

, Guys can rock this style out with some Victorian inspired clothes. You can modernize Dracula's outfit and it looks good with a comfortable cape. You girls can try red, white, or black corset, medieval or Victorian inspired dresses.
 There are bat-like ties for you guys, and girls, don't be afraid of tattoos, gloves, chokers and necklaces. Try wear an ankh somewhere.
, This will underline that you're not the sun-loving.person.
, Vampire books, vampire fiction or anything similar, but try ditching Twilight or mainstream vampire books.
,, Loxton is a great red, alcohol-free wine for you underage.
 Like Theatres Des Vampires and Inkubus Sukkubus.
