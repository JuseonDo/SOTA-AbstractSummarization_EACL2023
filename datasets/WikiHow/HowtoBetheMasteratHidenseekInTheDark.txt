@summary
put on some soft music, so if you make a little or big sound, more than likely, no one will hear.

@summary
try not to repeat hiding spots unless the hiding spot you've been using hasn't been found yet.

 Make sure everyone knows who goes first, second, and so on.;
, Now take a notebook and a pencil and search your house. Look for good hiding spots. If there's a really good spot, but say it has clothes in there, CLEAR IT OUT! Make room for some really good spots.
 Take another piece of paper and on one side put "OK Hiding Spots" and on the other put "Really Good Hiding Spots" or whatever you want to, and go through the house again, making sure you didn't miss any spots. Make sure you look outside, around your house, backyard, and places like that.
 Fill it in. Mark what's in it and whose room it is. Even put beds, tables, dressers, etc. Now take a colored marker and mark the places that are best. Carry this with you. Fold it up and slip it into your pocket or something.
 The bedroom. The living room. Kitchen. Family room...whatever. Now make a list of hiding spots near each one.
 If anything, bring a little cousin or someone who will follow you. Send them out if you wanna see if it's safe.
 See everything. Hear everything. Listen to everything.
 Don't play the boring way! Move to different hiding spots, but make sure no one is there to see or hear you. If you have a dog, you should keep it away. It will most likely follow you or stare at you, also a cat.
, Use it to your advantage! You could hide out the whole game and win! But where's the fun in that?
