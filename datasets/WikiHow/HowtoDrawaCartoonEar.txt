 Remember to erase where you are going to put the ears, and if you don't have an eraser, just leave the ear space blank.;
, We'll do it in steps. Look at the pictures for guidance. For the top of the ear, draw a circular archway, and then go down with your pencil. Then curve in a bit (Again, look at the drawing), curve out, and then diagonally go down to attach to the face.
 There are only three very easy to draw markings on a cartoon ear. At the top, a circular arch. In the middle, a small straight or lowly curved line. At the bottom, an upside down arch that is almost a straight line. Look at the drawing for examples.

, In cartoons, most teenage and adult girls have them. Earrings definitely spunk up the look, and is just a small extra detail, but is pleasing to the eye! Now, your first step to drawing an earring is to decide what type of earring you want. Do you want a fancy one, with jewels and whatever else in it? Or do you want a simple pearl, or a stud? It's your decision to make! Picture it in your head exactly to get the best results. Make your earrings match your character's personality helps as well!

, For instance, two triangles and a circle together look great! Then perhaps you could stud square diamonds in it? It's all your decision, so be creative!

, I don't think I'll even need a picture for this one! Draw your ear, put all the markings on it, then draw a big, fat circle underneath it! Color and decorate it all you want!
