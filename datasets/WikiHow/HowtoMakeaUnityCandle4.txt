 Be sure to center this evenly so that the ribbon underneath peeks out the same amount top and bottom.
 You can also glue a decoration onto the bead row if desired.
 Thinner lengths of ribbon can make a nice pattern when added above and below using the same method outlined in the previous steps. Be sure to keep the distances even between the center wrap and the other two ribbon wraps. If using two additional wraps, add the gauze layer but not the bead layer, as this can look overdone.
