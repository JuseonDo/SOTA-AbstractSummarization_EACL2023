 Be sure to keep any pets away, and warn other members of the family to leave it alone. You might also leave a note with it to tell your mom it's for her.


You can also use tealight candles if you're careful.
 Write "I Love You," "XOXO," or some other sweet note on them. You can also write it on plain paper to leave it in places she'll find it, like the flour bin or in her make-up case.
 Just be sure not to get polish on the paint. Also, make sure to leave her room to see where she's going., You can also buy pre-made ones, remove the fortune with tweezers, and stick yours back in.
