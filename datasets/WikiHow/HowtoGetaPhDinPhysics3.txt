 Get practice exams and preparation manuals. You can never be too ready. You may even want to take it a couple of times, just to increase your odds of getting a good score (ask whether it's to your advantage first).
 There is a wide range of topics. *Do not assume* that the questions will only be from the courses you've taken. In all likelihood, there will be questions from courses you haven't completed yet.
 Of course, the better score the better, but you'll probably already be good at the quantitative and analytical problems, and the verbal section doesn't matter as much. You should definitely take a look at the practice tests, though, to see where you might have trouble and know if you should prepare.
, Talk to the faculty you're most familiar with, and see if they feel strongly about certain schools. That way, you'll be more likely to choose a school is compatible with your interests, and more importantly, the faculty member will be an ally in the process and will probably increase the odds of you being accepted.
