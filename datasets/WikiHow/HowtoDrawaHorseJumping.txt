@summary
get familiar with the horse anatomy, and the gaits of a horse.

@summary
have a high quality image or model of a horse jumping at the desired angle, either launching or landing.

@summary
determine how high the obstacle the horse is jumping is.

@summary
start with the body of the horse.

@summary
finish at least the body above the legs, in both the front and back.

@summary
note that if the horse is launching or has just done so, its front legs will be curled under its body, while its hind legs are extended, on the ground or not.

@summary
sketch circles where the knees, ankles and hooves will be, in all four legs.

@summary
draw in the correct leg shapes using your image or model, either folded or extended.

@summary
move up to the neck/head.

@summary
complete the regular shapes needed for a neck and the head.

@summary
finish the entire body.

@summary
add all the detail of muscle you might have missed, and shading if desired, before comparing to your image.

 Make sure you understand the positions of the legs and the awkward shapes they can be in from different angles. If you aren't quite comfortable drawing horses at first, just spend some time sketching simple bodies/faces before hand.;
, You will be able to zoom in if you have difficulty seeing certain details. This will help you draw the correct shapes.
 This will create the angle of the body, mainly vertical or horizontal. You don't want the distance to be awkward!

, If it is going over a jump, the upper body will be tilted upwards. If the horse is landing, the front should tilt downwards. Use circles for the chest and hindquarters of the horse.
 Make sure to watch the proportions! Add muscle detail if you want.
 If it is landing, it will be the other way around. Horse always land on one hoof, placing all their weight here.
 Make sure that there is a reasonable gap between the horses' legs and the top of the obstacle, unless its very high so that it is clearly difficult. It can be brushing the obstacle here.
 Make changes if the angle is strange. Finish the legs completely, along with the hooves. If something doesn't look right, take a closer look!

, The neck should be arched, but not to a distressing degree. Try and mimic the position of the horse's neck and head in the picture. Depending on the height of the obstacle and the completion of the jump, the position will vary.
 Add all the necessary muscle features.
 Make sure that the mane and tail are not flat, but blown back.
 If you like the result, fill in the actual obstacle and draw or sketch the immediate surroundings if you haven't done so already.
