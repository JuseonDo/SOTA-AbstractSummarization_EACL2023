 Like other types of sugar, brown sugar makes an excellent exfoliant.

It is not recommended for acne, however., The antioxidants in the vitamin E oil will nourish your skin. It is also a natural preservative and will help your scrub last longer.You can get vitamin E oil at most health food stores. It usually comes in a capsule, but you can also find it in a bottle.
 This is not completely necessary, but it will make your scrub smell nicer and give you a more spa-like experience while you use it.

 Avoid using plastic contains. The oils in your scrub (especially the essential oils, if you are using them) will deteriorate the plastic. Some of the chemicals from the plastic may also leach into your scrub.
