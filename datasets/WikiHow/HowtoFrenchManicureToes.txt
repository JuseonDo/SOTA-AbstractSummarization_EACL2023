 Let it dry for half an hour to be safe (you will see why shortly). You could watch your favorite television show to help pass some time. If it is not completely dry, your pedicure could not turn out right. How bad would that be?;
, This will be the color of your tip.
 The space you leave left over will eventually create the tip of your pedicure.
 Paint the space you had left over with the polish. Do that for all of your toe-nail.
 If you remove the tape while it is still wet your supposed-to-be straight line won't be so straight. I suggest waiting another half-hour before removing the tape.
 This will allow it to last longer.
