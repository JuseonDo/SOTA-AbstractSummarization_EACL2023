 Also, put your cake cases in the cupcake baking tray, using 12 cases. If you want to, you can use double cases for more sturdy cakes.;
,, The mixture might go lumpy, but when you add the flour it will get smooth again. You still need to mix it so it's as smooth as you can get it.
 Fold them together with a spoon.. Add the vanilla extract.
, Keep adding until you have a color you're happy with. If you prefer pastel, less artificial looking shades, you can add less color.
 You can make it a more golden shade with more red, or a brighter shade with more yellow!

, If you think it's too bright add more blue and if you think it's too dark add more yellow.
 Make sure you don't add too much blue, because this will make it really dark and not a very attractive color.
 Make sure there's an equal amount in each one. You need to add each color one at a time and either layer them or go for a swirly look (in which case you must apply colours randomly- but don't mix unless you want a brown color!).
 When they come out they should be soft and slightly firm, but golden and slightly brown. You want them to have a slight crunch on the outside.
 Make your own buttercream frosting and ice them.
 Yummy!
