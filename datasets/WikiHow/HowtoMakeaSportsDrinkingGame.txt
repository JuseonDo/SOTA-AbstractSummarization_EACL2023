 If you're in a bar, you can pitch in other sports fans for this game.;
, A person must drink a shot, of their favorite drink or something everyone agrees on, every time something happens in the game.
 This "key" must be also agreed on, and varies between different sports. Here's a few examples:


Football (American): Touchdown for the home team, cheerleader camera shot, interception, etc.
Pro-wrestling: Every time someone says their "catch-phrase" (for example Hulk Hogan with "Brother"), every time someone interferes in a match, etc.
Baseball: Home runs, foul balls, etc.
Hockey: Goals, every time someone slams into the glass, etc.
