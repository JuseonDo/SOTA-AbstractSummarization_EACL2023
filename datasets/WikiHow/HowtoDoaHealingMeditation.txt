 Let the light of the sun flow down on you and massage it into the body.;
, May all beings in the world be happy."

, Let light flow into it, massage it in circles and think the word "light" as a mantra. By the light massage you resolve the tensions in the body and enable the self-healing.
 I take the suffering in my life. I consistently walk my way of health and healing."

, Rub your hands in front of the heart chakra and think, "Om Buddha of Healing. Om inner wisdom. Please guide and help me on my way."

, What is the way of your healing? What do you have to do? What triggers your problem? Think so long until you are satisfied with the result. When you hear no answer, you are either blocked inside (you don't want to see the real causes of the problem), or you have a bad contact to your inner voice. The best way then is slowly to get into thinking about your problem.
 My problem is ... The way of healing is ..."

, Stop all other thoughts. Feel calmness, serenity and peace in you. Stop a minute every thought and move gently our feet. Focus on your feet and move on, until your mind comes completely to rest. Then linger in a slight meditation. All thoughts and feelings may come and go as they please. Relax.
