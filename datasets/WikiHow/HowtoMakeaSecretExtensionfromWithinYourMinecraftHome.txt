@article
 For this particular secret extension you need a flat wall from a cliff. If you can't find one on land look higher above the hill or cliff.;
, Make sure it comes into the cliff (or hill) then mine first a small hallway and keep it that way. We will come back to this later.
, The painting must be at least 1x2 squares, 2x2 squares works best.
 Drink a night vision potion, continue the hallway and dig out a room.
 Bigger is usually better.
 Add torches to your room.
 Try making a Secret lab, chillout room or even a sneaky hiding place. You name it, you build it.
 Have fun!
