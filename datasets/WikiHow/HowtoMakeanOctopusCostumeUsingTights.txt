  Leave at least 3 inches of leg material attached to the panty part.  Stuff the legs with polyester batting.  Keep all scraps.;
,  Stuff batting between the layers.  Pin at the neck and bottom and take the shirts off.  Sew the two shirts together at the pinned edges.
  Pin the tentacles around the arm holes of the shirt. Cut a 4 inch slit at the wrist to stick your hand out and tint the hand with green make-up. Remove the shirt and sew the arm tentacles around the armholes, remove the pins.
  Remove costume and sew the tentacles to the body shirt.  Attach through both layers of shirt.  This stabilizes the tentacles.
 Stuff the toe area of two white socks with batting to make baseball size eyes. Wrap and tie off the eyeballs with heavy duty thread. Cut off the sock tops. Stick the eyes in the leg holes of the panty section, scrunching the excess green material down around the base of the eyeball for wrinkles. Make the eyeballs bloodshot with red permanent marker. Put green make up on your face.
 Wear this around your neck to join the neck and head areas.
, Put glue only in the center so the suction cup will stand out slightly.
