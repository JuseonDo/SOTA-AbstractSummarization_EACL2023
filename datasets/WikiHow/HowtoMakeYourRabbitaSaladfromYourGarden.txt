 Dandelions are invasive garden weeds that can be found just about anywhere. There are two types of dandelions, the real kind and the false kind. Real dandelions have jagged leaves, while false dandelion leaves appear rounder and a lighter shade of green. Real dandelion flowers also do not have a bud in the middle of the flowers.;
, Sow thistle is a very common weed that will most likely be growing among your lawn. The leaves are purplish-green and have a serrated edging. The flowers are small and yellow, usually at the end of a long stalk. Be careful when touching the plant, its leaves can leave a scratch if you’re not careful.
 This is also known as wood sorrel is a type of clover that can be found growing in clusters among bare patches of lawn space. Most rabbits like to nibble on the flavorful clover, but remember not to add too much as clover can give rabbits gas that can’t be released.
 This is a very thorny weed. This is an optional backyard green that you may add to your rabbit salad. Use gardening gloves to avoid being pricked.
 The prickles are located under the leaf in a straight line on the backside of the leaves. The red spikes are also located on the stem, giving the plant a “hairy” appearance.
 This weed branches out in many directions and has yellowish-green tinted leaves. The stem is a bright red hue, you can break off a branch to check if the plant is sun spurge. If there is white plant blood oozing out, you have found the right plant.
 Use a pair of gloves if you decided to add some prickly weeds to the rabbit salad.
,, Once you have gathered a desired amount of backyard greens in the container, cover it with your hand or with a lid and shake it. Make sure to mix everything around., If they/it likes it feel free to make some more!
