 Before you use any soap or detergent make sure that it's appropriate for the patio tiles, some tiles need a special cleaner.
, When preferred you can also spray white vinegar between the cracks of the tiles to remove and kill the weeds.
 Be careful that the soapy water does end up on your lawn or flower beds as this can kill them!
