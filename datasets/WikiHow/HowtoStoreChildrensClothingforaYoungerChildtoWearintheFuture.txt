 They can be clear if you are storing the clothing in a dark place like an attic or a basement; otherwise they should be dark and opaque to protect clothes from fading.;
, Wash thoroughly and run through the dryer till bone dry, and have the dry-cleanable ones dry-cleaned. 

,  By cleaning the clothes you are removing temptations for them, as well as getting rid of any eggs that are on there.
, Everyone's sorting will look different -- some people might just have piles of "young boys" and "older girls" clothing -- others might have a pile labeled "boys 12 months," "boys 18 months," etc. 

, Most clothes you buy these days aren't intended to last for generations, and really, who wants to wear old underwear?  Don't kid yourself by saving socks and underwear unless you are the really, REALLY thrifty type.  Make them into rags (old socks on your hands are great for polishing wood and silver.) 

,,, This keeps deep creases from happening and makes the best use of your space. So lay out a shirt, fold it vertically (from neck to waist), and roll it tight from the bottom. Ditto pants -- lay them out, fold vertically, and roll it tight. 

, If you have cleaned the clothes thoroughly bugs should not be an issue. If you want to put SOMETHING in with the clothes, you can put in cedar blocks or balls, but be aware that the oils from these can stain clothes.  Same with dryer sheets. 

, If you are putting more than one sorting bundle in a box, you may want to tie the bundles separately with string.  Put a masking tape label on the string., Poufy skirts and dresses should go on the top. 

, "Boys - 2-3 years"  "Girls - 4-6x"

, If you have to stack, do it so the youngest clothing is on top and you can work your way to the bottom of the stack through the years.
