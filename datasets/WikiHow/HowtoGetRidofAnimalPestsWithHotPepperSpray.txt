 Hot peppers have a compound in them called capsaicin. Mammals are sensitive to capsaicin, and the compound registers on their taste buds as "hot" and serves as an irritant. This spray is considered to be effective for such garden animal pests as deer, rabbits, voles, squirrels, possums and insects.;

, Label it so that anyone coming across it knows what the contents are; it's also a good idea to add the date to it.


For added sticking power, you might like to add a few drops of pure dish soap to the liquid as well.
 Always wear gloves and eye protection before using this spray––it can burn your skin and eyes if it touches them and it's painful. Be sure to spray the entire plant, for full protection.


Shake before using.
Use the spray early morning or in the evening––if sprayed in the heat of the day, it may burn the plants.If you're not sure how sensitive plants will cope, test a small area first. Wait four days and if the plant doesn't react, then using the spray on it should be okay.Do not spray this on windy days. The back spray may hit you or go anywhere but on the plants you're trying to protect.
As mentioned earlier, do not spray anywhere near waterways, lakes or ponds.
 It will also need to be reapplied after rain.
