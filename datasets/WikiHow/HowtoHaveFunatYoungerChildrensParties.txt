 Some great ideas are toys, of course, but you can also be a bit more creative. Put together a "gift pack" filled with coloring books, crayons, and small games. Some of the simplest things can bring entertainment to a child. Also, if you're at a complete loss for what to give the child, you can get a card and put ten bucks in it so they can buy something that they know they will enjoy. If the birthday party has a theme, buy something that goes with the theme. That way you know they will like it! It also helps to check with their parent(s) to make sure you're not giving the child something they already have.;
, Parties for children usually aren't fancy at all, so make sure you dress down. A lot of play will go on, and messes will probably be made, so make sure you wear something decent but also make sure it isn't something you mind getting a drink, food, or some dirt on. A nice pair of jeans and a nice t-shirt will usually do the trick. Just make sure it's something that's not too dressy and easy to get clean.
 If they're having a game of tag out in the yard, go ahead and play! Don't let your "adulthood" get in the way of having fun. Make the best of it!

, When/if the party starts to get a little dull, start up one of those games.
 Are you an artist? If so, bring some finger-paint and some paper and let the kids make their own art. If you play guitar, learn a few children's songs and take your guitar along with you. Have a sing-along! You don't just have to be a guest, you can be part of the entertainment too.
 Don't sit there and act bored. Smile and sing!

, At the end of the day when you go home, you will probably look back and think about how much you enjoyed yourself!
