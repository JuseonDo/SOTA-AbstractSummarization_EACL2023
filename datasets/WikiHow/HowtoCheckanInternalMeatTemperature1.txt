 If you think you may have difficulty operating a digital thermometer, buy one with a needle gauge. However, digital thermometers do have a distinct advantage. They provide a more precise temperature reading in a matter of seconds. This will keep less heat from escaping your oven or outdoor grill while your are checking the meat's temperature.;
, An instant read thermometer is inserted into the meat at the end of cooking time to check the internal temperature.
 A probe is designed to be inserted in the meat before the meat is placed in the oven, and allows you to monitor the temperature and know when the meat has finished cooking.
