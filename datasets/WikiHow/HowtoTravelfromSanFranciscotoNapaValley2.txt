 Choose the time you would like to catch the ferry. Note that commuters take the ferries, so commuting times before 10 a.m. and after 4 p.m. will need to be booked well in advance and may be crowded. Ferries leave approximately between 30 minutes and 1 hour of each other.
 Tickets cost approximately $13 (9 euros, 8 pounds) for adults. You can buy your ticket by going to the San Francisco Ferry Building 30 minutes to 1 hour ahead of time.
 The ferry will depart from the large, white Ferry Building at the beginning of Market Street. This is also called the Embarcadero. Most forms of public transportation and all taxis will take you to the Ferry Building. Leave early in case of delays.


You can also depart from Pier 41 in Fisherman's Wharf. There are only 3 departures from this dock per day, as opposed to 12 departures from the Ferry Building.
 There will be a docking point for ferries and you will see signs telling you where the Vallejo ferry is located at Gate B. Wait in the line for the ferry if you are early.


Make sure you do not board the Tiburon Ferry. It also boards at Gate B.
,, The Vine is the transit system that connects the Napa Valley. You can choose to get off at Napa, Yountville, Rutherford, St. Helena or Calistoga. The cost is approximately $3 (2 euros, 1.8 pounds) for the regular route.


This is the best method to choose if you do not want to drive, or if you would like a 1 hour view of the bay and have planned a leisurely trip.
