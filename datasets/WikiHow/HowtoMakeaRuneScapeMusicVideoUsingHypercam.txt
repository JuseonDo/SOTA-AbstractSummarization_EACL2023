 This is one of the major things you are going to need.;
, Thinking of a song will help you learn the song more and more.
 Nothing works better than practicing the song you feel like doing. But make sure that the song is appropriate and doesn't violate the rules and conduct on Runescape.
 Start little by practicing little parts of the song until you think you have it memorized. You can listen to the song at www.Youtube.com .
 Say you had the song, I'm Just a Kid by Simple Plan. The plot would probably be like. You wake up in the morning, 4 walls staring at you and you staring at them. Later on your friends have somewhere to be and they run off leaving you behind.
 Now that you have practiced and figured out the plot, now is the time for you to go for it and finally get to make your very first runescape music video.
