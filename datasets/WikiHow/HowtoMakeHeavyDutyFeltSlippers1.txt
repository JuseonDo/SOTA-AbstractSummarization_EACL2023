 This may mean that instead of hitting the craft store you may need to visit a fabric retailer or wholesaler for the right material. You want felt that is several layers thick and able to withstand a little wear and tear (although you shouldn’t wear these slippers outside the home).;
, While you may be tempted to use the hole punch you have for school projects, you will need something with a little more power in order to punch through the heavy felt.
 You will need one set (2 strings) per shoe. Make sure they are slightly longer than average and compliment the color felt you’ve chosen.
, You will want to mimic the fit when creating your slippers.
