 You should only pour a small puddle of paint into the tray. Putting too much in at once increases the likelihood of spills and messes.
 Many "kids" paints are spreadable enough and do not need water, but tempera paint is thick and can be hard to work with. Only add a little water, though. Adding too much will make it too runny and just as hard to work with.
 Do not hold it in the paint too long, or else it will become too saturated and will not produce the airy, "spongy" look.
 The more paint that drips off, the less thick it will appear on whatever surface you and your kids use it on.
 The entire bottom of the sponge must come into contact with the paper or painting surface. Do not press so hard that you "squeeze" the paint out of the sponge, however.
 Eager children may want to jump in after seeing it once, preferring to learn through trial and error. Other kids may ask to see the process multiple times in order to learn through observation.
