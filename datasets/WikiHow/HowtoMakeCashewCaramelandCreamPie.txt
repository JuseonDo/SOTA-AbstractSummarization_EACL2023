 Sift the plain flour and the icing sugar into a large mixing bowl.
 Blend the cashews in a food processor until they are completely ground. Next, add them to the flour and icing sugar.
 Throw the cubed and chilled butter in with the other ingredients. Use your hands to rub the butter through the mixture until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.
 Use a butter knife to bring the mixture to a dough. If your mixture is not forming a dough because it is too dry, add another tablespoon of water. If your mixture is too wet, sift in a little more flour., Once you have formed the dough, inside your mixing bowl, roll it into a ball. Cover your bowl in glad-wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes.
 Lightly flour a bench top and roll the dough out till it is large enough to fit a 25cm tart tin. Trim off any excess dough and refrigerate for another 25 minutes.
 Put either rice or baking beads on the baking paper to prevent the base from rising. Cook for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and remove the baking paper. Cook for another 25 minutes or until golden. Take it out of the oven and set aside to cool completely.
 Heat on low heat until butter is melted.
 When it thickens and turns a light caramel in colour, remove from heat. Allow the caramel to cool slightly before pouring it onto the pie base.
 Refrigerate for an hour.
 Whip the cream until firm.
 Add the white chocolate to the cream and mix gently with a metal spoon.
 Spread out evenly with a metal knife.
 Once melted, decorate the cream on top of the pie in any pattern you like. Enjoy!
