 If you spend it on land, you aren't living underwater!

, Not land. That ruins the underwater promise.
 Do not live on land just because you want to spend your gems and diamonds on land animal goodies. If you live underwater for a month, you are likely to have four diamonds and a boatload of gems from the saving.
 That way you have more gems for underwater goodies. And when rare item Monday has an ocean item, you get it!
