 As a family event, this mitzvah begins with preparing the house for Shabbat. Cleaning, cooking, baking challah, setting the table, let your little girl join you in as much as she's able. So that she can help and feel how important Shabbat is.;
, Your daughter's grandmothers, aunts, and cousins. Many girls and women who can also participate in the Mitzvah of lighting the Shabbat candles.
 It is her birthday and this is part of her celebration. What better way to celebrate than with a cake to memorialize her performing the Shabbat Mitzvah for the first time.
 When they complete the poem, pause for the birthday girl to say her prayers and have her mother or grandmother help her light a Shabbat candle of her own. Consider giving her a candlestick of her very own to celebrate this Mitzvah.
 It also lights the world and throws darkness back into the shadows. That she brings light into the family and into our world.
 Follow it with a cake.
 Put a special invitation out to the women of the synagogue to attend and light candles with your daughter on her special night.
 Or, better yet, Shabbat dinner.
, As soon as the girl has finished lighting her first Shabbat candle, have every other women there also light their own Shabbat candles.
 Let your little girl help serve.
 Despite this perhaps not being her actual birthday party, it is probably the most meaningful thing she will do while she is three years old. It is definitely the most spiritual. This is an incredible Mitzvah you are allowing others to share in. Let her feel how important the day is to everyone and how meaningful it is. She will remember it always.
