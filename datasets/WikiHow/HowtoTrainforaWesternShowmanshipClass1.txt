walk is the very basic movement, and is often judged with scrutiny.

@summary
encourage the horse to walk by clicking your tongue and by putting pressure on the lead.

 To walk the horse, you should stand at the near side shoulder (left shoulder). You should try to get the horse to move off before you do, as this looks better in a show ring.;
, Once walking, you should be standing between the shoulder and neck.
