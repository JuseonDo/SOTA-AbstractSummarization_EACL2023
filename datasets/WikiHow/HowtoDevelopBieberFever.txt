Reading these 3 books will try to make you like him even more.
,,


Listening to his songs will make you feel happy or not. If listening to his old songs is not helping, try listening to his new songs from "Believe" or "Believe Acoustic".



Try looking at his pictures for about a few minutes.This may make you change your mind and make you want to be happy and love him.



Watching videos of him preforming live on his Believe tour is a great idea! But, make sure the videos is where you can see him up close or you may wanna exit out of the video.



Watching these type of videos may be inappropriate to some, but try to watch it when your alone. Watching too much videos of this maybe become addicting to some,but I'd say you should watch 2 videos of this. This may make you realize that Justin is hot and gorgeous and will make you go crazy over him. This will probably help 90%.



Don't think about him in an ugly way and DON'T think about the other celebrities you like, like One Direction. Think about if Justin was your boyfriend and what would you do together? What kind of date would you to go out on. Beach? Dinner and movie? Would he propose to you? What will the wedding look like?

,,


This will help you a lot. If you have a best friend that's a fan, talk to her about him. Like how and when did you start liking him?

,


If you have a Twitter account, this will work! If you start to feel confident enough, you may wanna follow him. If no twitter, follow him on Facebook!

,


To start off, get "Believe" or "Believe Acoustic". If you want to listen to the old Biebs then go ahead! But if you're afraid, don't and if you're not confident,either. But, if you start hating his old music, switch back to his new right away! And while listening, look at some pis!

,,


This might make you understand that Justin is only human, he makes mistakes just like the rest of us.
Now more likely you will have Bieber Fever!
