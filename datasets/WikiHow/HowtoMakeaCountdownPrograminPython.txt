 Give the function a name of your choice. This article will be using 'countdown,' so the code would be "def countdown(t):." Remember to leave four spaces after the colon.
 Type in the code "while t > 0:" This will cause the program to, while the alphabet is defined as greater than zero, perform this function: "print(t)t = Â t -1." The number will be constantly decremented as the function progresses and completes a loop cycle.
 Type in the following code to print out 'BLAST OFF!' when the countdown reaches zero. "<4 spaces> if t == 0:<4 spaces>print("BLAST OFF!")."
