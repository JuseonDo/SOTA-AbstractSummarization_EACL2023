 It is the most important factor on which the architectural photography depends. If you want to click the photograph of a door or any entrance, then keep in mind that it should align with whatever is inside the entrance. You can see in the picture below, all the pillars are aligned to each other giving you a finished look.
 You can see in the pictures below that in the first picture, the temple is not completely fitting into the camera screen making it look weird. The next one shows the correct form of doing so.
