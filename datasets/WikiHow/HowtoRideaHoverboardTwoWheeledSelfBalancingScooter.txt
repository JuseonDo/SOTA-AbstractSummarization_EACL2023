The on button is normally a silver push kind, located on the back near the charge port.
 If it doesn't, then charge it using the cable provided.

There is often a light 'next to the battery gauge, if it turns green then it is safe to put your second foot on, if it is red then turn off the board and try again. If the problem persists contact the supplier.



If the scooter moves its fine, just re-position and start again.
Keep going until you get it right.
,, You will turn.


It is very important to keep your other foot horizontal, if you don't do this then it will counteract the turn and may unbalance you.
,, Most mini self-balancing scooters can handle slopes of up to 15 degrees, Â although it does vary with brands.
 When you achieve top speed you will normally hear a beep. This tells you that you have maxed out the speed and should slow down.


Now you can start to do spins and go at decent speeds!
