 Most of us don't realize that we are wonderful. Unfortunately, just hearing it once, it won't stick. They need to know that their brilliance is seen by others.;
, Don't just say it...mean it.
 Don't just present a good face. People know, most of the time, when you aren't being authentic.
 While you want to share with your friends, if all they hear from you are negative things, that is what they will feel about you.
 Let them know you are listening by looking at them when they are talking. That text message is not that important.
 If you actually managed to do that, they would no longer be the person that you met and liked.
 Just because they are different than you doesn't mean that they are wrong. How boring would the world be then!?

,, Then you would be changing yourself to 'suit others'.
 Just because you don't get why they are living and breathing, doesn't mean they shouldn't be.
