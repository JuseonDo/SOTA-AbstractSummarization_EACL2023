 Many smokers believe that they will someday quit cold turkey they have to do is make a simple decision to do so.Nicotine is a powerfully addictive drug, so ending a smoking habit abruptly can result in uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms with both physical and psychological effects.
 Though much of the effects of vaping have yet to be researched, studies show that vaping allows users to gradually wean down their nicotine use over time. This reduces the addictive properties of smoking, while also reducing the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke inhalation.Many smokers have used vaping to successfully end their smoking habit for good.


Vaping involves no fire or combustion but a device which is used to vaporize the E-liquid for inhalation. E-liquid usually contains propylene glycol, flavorings and optional doses of nicotine.E -cigarettes are also battery powered devices which use liquid to produce a vapor for inhalation., Most nicotine replacement therapy products are available over the counter, with the exception of inhalers.
