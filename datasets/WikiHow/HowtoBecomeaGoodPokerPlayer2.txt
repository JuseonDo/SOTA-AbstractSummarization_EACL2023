 The most popular game at the moment is Texas Hold 'Em, but Omaha and 7 Card Stud are also very common. You can learn poker rules from friends or a simple web search.
 There are many of these, including pokertactics.org, ultimatebet.com, pokerstars.net, and fulltiltpoker.com.
 Pay attention to which hands tend to win most often and how often certain hands arise. This should become second nature over time.
 Websites like duckspoker.net and pokertips.org as well as books like Doyle Brunson's Super System can be invaluable resources.
 If there is a casino within driving distance, make the trip and place some low stakes poker. Most casinos offer either a $2-4 or $3-6 Texas Hold 'Em game. These games are usually pretty soft (easy to beat) and provide a good starting point for the novice poker player. If you don't have access to a casino, create a real money account on your favorite online poker room and play whatever limits you feel comfortable with. (Though this is not legal in the US)

, Real money players are much better than the play money opponents you've been beating on the internet. If you play with discipline, patience, and intelligence, you are likely to win money.
 Talented poker players acquire their skill from thousands upon thousands of hands of experience. If you continue to play poker with discipline and an open mind, you should improve consistently.
