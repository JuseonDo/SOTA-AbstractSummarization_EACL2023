, If you want your palm tree can just stick out straightly from the side of the coast, but no matter what make sure you keep your lines parallel.
 Draw a half circle and some clouds made of several circles.
 Draw banana-shaped forms attached to the end of the log on the tip. Do so all around the end of the trunk until you have a sufficiently full-leaved palm tree.
 To do so just follow the palm tree-drawing steps prior to this one. Erase the lines inside the cloud you drew before, as well as any other unnecessary marks.
 The water will reflect these colors as well, so keep that in mind.
