 If you have marshmallows in different colors and sizes, put them into different bowls, so that patterns can be made.;
, Roll it out with the rolling pin to make it flat. It needs to be thin enough to thread through the needle's eye.
 Push the needle and licorice lace through the center of the first marshmallow.
 Keep the marshmallows close together onto the licorice lace, to allow you to fit lots on.
 Don't thread right to the ends though, as there needs to be enough of the lace left to tie the knot.
 The necklace is now formed.
 Wear it for a while, then enjoy munching on it.
