 The drain-waste-overflow pipe assembly must be positioned correctly. Place the rubber gasket on top of the waste overflow, which is the top opening of the pipe. Align the drain tailpiece at the bottom of the pipe with the tub drain hole.
 Place a thick layer that covers the bottom of the flange. Clean any putty off the bathtub immediately to avoid having it dry and stick to the tub surface., Adjust it within the hole, and screw the drain flange into the drain tailpiece opening. Make sure it is secure, but not overly tight in case it needs to be adjusted later., These components can be found at any hardware or home improvement store. Choose something that will fit tastefully with the decorative theme of the bathroom., Do not attach the stopper to the tub. Leave all the connections loose so that they can be tightened and adjusted during the installation process., The hardware should come with screws. Fasten the trip lever assembly to the tub overflow cover plate., Tighten and secure the stopper., Use a screwdriver to make sure there are no loose pieces, or gaps and holes between the hardware and the tub. Turn on the water and test the bathtub drain. Make sure the water pools when the drain lever is flipped up, and drains when the lever is flipped down.
