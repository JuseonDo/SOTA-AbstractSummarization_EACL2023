@summary
find the center of gravity of the rocket.

@summary
tie a four to six foot string around the rocket at this point.

@summary
with the rocket suspended by the string, spin in a circle.

@summary
adjust the rocket to make it stable.
@article
 This is the point at which you can balance the rocket on your finger.;
, When hung from the string, the rocket should be parallel to the ground.
 If the rocket is stable, it will point forward in the direction you're turning.
 There are two ways to do this.


Move the center of gravity forward by adding weight to the nose.
Move the center of pressure to the rear by enlarging or adding more fins.
