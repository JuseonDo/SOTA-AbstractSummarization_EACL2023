@summary
decide on the diameter you want your dog bed to be.

@summary
plan out a circular pattern of fabric that will consist of square pieces of fabric.

@summary
use this formula to determine how many 3 1/4-inch by 5 1/2-inch rectangles you'll need to complete your circle: pet bed diameter in inches x 3.14 divided by 2.75 inches (7.0Â cm).

@summary
once you've determined how many squares you need, begin to cut out the squares from your fabric.

@summary
assemble the pieces together into a large square using either a sewing machine or sewing by hand.

next, assemble the pieces together for the second side of the bed using the same sewing technique.

measure the desired diameter of your pet bed onto each of the two square fabric pieces that you created.

@summary
sew most of the two quilts together with a 1/2-inch seam allowance, using a sewing machine or sewing by hand.

stuff the dog bed with the stuffing of your choice into the remaining open section.

 You can either cut your dog bed insert to the desired size if it is cuttable (like egg crate for instance), or simply draw up a template.


Add one inch to your plans for seam allowances.
 You will probably want to use cotton for this project.
 Round up to the nearest whole number to make computation easier.
 You can also cut out triangular-shaped hourglass blocks to create a varied pattern.


Use a combination of solid and print fabrics to spice up your quilted dog bed.
For a simpler variation, use an old quilt instead of fashioning a new one.
,, Cut out each circle using scissors and lay the two quilts on top of one another with the rough sides touching.


If using a pre-made circular insert or an egg crate, place the insert between the two pieces of fabric before beginning to sew.
 Remember to fold each edge of the quilt inward in order to form a thicker, smoother edge. Make sure to leave a section of the edge open large enough to fit the stuffing through.
 Once again, you can use polyester stuffing, old clothes, pillows, etc. to stuff your dog bed.


Because the quilted covering is more sturdy than, say, a flannel tie covering, you can use heavier stuffing with this method.
 If you are advanced at sewing, you can incorporate a zipper along the sewn edge of the bed in order to remove the stuffing for washing if desired.
