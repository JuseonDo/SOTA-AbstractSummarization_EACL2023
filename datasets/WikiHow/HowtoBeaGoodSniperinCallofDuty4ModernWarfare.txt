 If you rely on getting 1 shot kills, use either of the bolt action rifles or the Barret. The Barret .50 cal is a sniper rifle you should choose though. It is very powerful and accurate. However, if you are new to the game, you may need more practice than the semi-auto; sniper rifles are fine.;
, Using perks that benefit a sniper is a must; the most effective combination for this is claymores, stopping power and Iron Lungs. Also try the UAV jammer and Dead Silence perks, these are crucial for silence and stealth.
 As enemies seeking revenge on you will easily come looking for you. In hardcore modes, where there are no kill cams, you can stay in one spot for a while, but it is still a better idea to move around to other areas.

Don't just stand there and do nothing. Hide in places like rooftops and grassy areas. Use stealth and your gillie suit to your advantage.
 Staying in one spot for extended periods of time exposes you to more danger as a sniper.
, Make sure you give the map a quick sweep and be off.
 snipe on every map that you can even if it is a small map. If it is a small map just use an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) scope instead of a regular scope.

If you glitch, you might be frowned upon by other players but hey you still get the kills, you also could get kick/banned from the server so don't do it, it is cheating.
 When you use the ghillie suit make sure that when you are laying down that you use slow and steady movements instead of jerky movements.
 If you do, it might expose you from the flash of your Sniper. So take your time to aim.
 On the Start menu, go down to Options and change your sensitivity to the preferable sensitivity, a high sensitivity could be hard to get the crosshair on the enemy, so only use it if you have had practice!
