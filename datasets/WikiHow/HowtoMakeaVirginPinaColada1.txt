 This drink comes together quickly when you add all the ingredients at once. Reserve the pineapple slices, though - those are for the garnish., It might take several pulses to get the creamy texture of a classic pi√±a colada.
 You can use hurricane glasses for a festive feel.
 Float the pineapple rings on top of the drinks and put the cherries in the middle of the rings.
