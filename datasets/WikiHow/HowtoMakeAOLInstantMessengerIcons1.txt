Click on the Expressions tab. To be able to accept your own image as an icon, you will probably have to click the option "All Buddy Icons" as the choice for which icons to accept.
After making sure your AIM will accept a file from your computer as an icon, go to the top right corner of the Expressions tab. There is a picture of your current icon there, and under it there are two options. Click on "Browse...".
Find the file for your icon, select it, and press "Open".
A warning should appear about the rights to the image. Press "OK".
After this, MAKE SURE you press "Save" before closing the Settings window; otherwise, you will have to do all of this over again.
 Hover over "Edit Options", then click on "Edit Preferences" (or just press F3)
Under the "Expressions" section of the "Edit Preferences" window, make sure the checkbox for "Display Buddy Icons" is checked, as well as the bubble that says "Display all Buddy Icons".
At the top right corner of the page, there is a button labeled "Browse PC..." Click it.
Select your icon's file, and press "Select". A warning should appear that is about rights to the image, etc. Click "OK".
Make sure you press "Apply", otherwise you will have to do it over again.
 Congratulations!
