iMessage is only available on OS X Mountain Lion or higher.


,, It’s at the top-left corner of the page.
 This will open the Preferences window.



It may send you to the Accounts menu by default, and you won't need to click it.
 The box should now be empty.



If you want to sign out of iMessage altogether, click Sign Out next to your Apple ID, and then click Sign Out again. This will take all iMessage information, such as contacts and conversations, off of your Mac.
If you're still receiving SMS messages on your Mac and want to disable it, you'll need to disable Text Message Forwarding on your iPhone. This is in your Messages settings.
