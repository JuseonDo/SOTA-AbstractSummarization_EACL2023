you can vastly speed up this three-stroke process of choosing the priority level by using the keyboard.

 A window will pop up, called "Windows Task Manager". If not, a window with various options will pop up; click on "Task Manager".


Alternatively, the keyboard shortcut to go directly to Task Manager is Ctrl+â‡§ Shift+Esc

Another option is, right click on the task bar, anywhere on the empty space, you will see options, click on the Task Manager.;

These priority names are intuitively obvious; they mean just what they say.
The priority level starts out at "Normal", and stays there unless YOU change it.
The higher (or lower) you set the program's 'priority', the more (or fewer) system resources will be allocated to it, so it will run faster (or slower) than it did before. "Low", for example, is fine for a program running in background that you do not need to have finish up soon, so that more resources are freed up. "Realtime" is best for something that absolutely has to have maximum resources right now!

,, Once you have right-clicked on the process, just hit the letter "p" to choose "Priority", then the letter that corresponds to your desired level (e.g., "A" for "Above normal"), then "Y" for "yes". A lot faster than mousing or clicking!
