,, The ears are not visible because of Spiderman’s mask.
, These eyes of the costumes are being drawn depending on the emotions of Spiderman. For now, we’ll draw this typical relaxed eye expression of Spiderman since we are only drawing an icon design.
 The web should always be symmetric and conform to the shape of Peter’s body. In this case, the eyes, nose and mouth should still be emphasized without drawing their actual look. Since the mask is also made by a special kind of superhero cloth, drawing it should still have the same techniques of drawing a cloth while it’s worn by the subject.
 There should be one origin on the face that is between the eyes of Spiderman.
