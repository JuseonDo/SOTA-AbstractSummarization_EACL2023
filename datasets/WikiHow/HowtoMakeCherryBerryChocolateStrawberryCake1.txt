 Grease a 23 cm (9 inch) round cake tin and line the bottom with greaseproof paper. If you are making three layers, you will need three tins, one for each cake.;
, Set aside.
 Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.
 (You can use the bowl from your stand mixer to save washing a second bowl. If you’d rather not, then pour the mixture into the bowl of your stand mixer after the eggs are heated.)

, This will take about 5 minutes and the batter is beaten sufficiently when it falls back into the bowl in a ribbon-like pattern.
 Do not overmix or you will deflate the batter.
 Combine the warm butter and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Stephanie suggest folding some of the batter into the butter to lighten it and then folding the butter mixture into the rest of the batter. Just don’t forget to fold in the butter until you’ve poured the batter into the tin. When completely combined, pour the batter into the prepared tin, gently smoothing the top.
, When the cake has cooled completely, run a knife or spatula around the edges to release it. The genoise will keep well-wrapped two days in the fridge or three months frozen. It can last four days in the fridge kept in a cake dome.
