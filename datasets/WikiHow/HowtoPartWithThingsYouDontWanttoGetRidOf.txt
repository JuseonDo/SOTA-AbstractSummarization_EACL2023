make decluttering a habit.

@summary
if you have more than one of any particular item, think about keeping the better model and passing on the other(s. maybe you have a friend who can make better use out of your spare vacuum than you can.

@summary
keep a photo of the item instead.

@summary
write a short history of the item to go with the photo.

@summary
look for ways the item could be more useful to someone else.

@summary
focus on the positive results of decluttering your home: more space, fewer things dragging you down, and less fuel in case of a house fire.

@summary
,

@summary
consider selling the item and using the money for something that you need or want, and which would be more useful or attractive.

@summary
once you've made the decision, get rid of it immediately.

@summary
if you can't quite bring yourself to get rid of it, pack it up and put it somewhere to store for a set amount of time, such as a year or six months.

@summary
if the previous tip doesn't work for you, because you see an item and think "i would definitely have used that if i knew it was there", don't put the item back in the box/ drawer/ closet.

@summary
don't be too hard on yourself if you still can't bring yourself to get rid of some things.

 It's easier to part with things when you are doing it on a regular basis and can see the positive results. If you can't get rid of that 20-year-old cheer-leading uniform that you'll never wear again, maybe a year of decluttering other items will make it easier to part with later.;
, Or sell your extras in a yard sale before you end up with an unintended collection.
 If you don't want to give-up something for sentimental reasons, but can't justify the space it takes up, take a photo or photos of it. It can even be more fun to go through a photo album or scrapbook and remember things than it is to pull them out of a dusty box. (Besides, holding up the cheer-leading uniform and noting how small you were "back then" can be really depressing.)

, This will help you remember stories or details that you might forget later, and is great for sharing with family and friends.
 Instead of collecting dust, it could have real purpose again! Focus on this, and give it away. Enjoy the good feeling that comes with sharing and helping others!

,, The ugly lamp that Aunt Cheryl gave you could be replaced by something else that would make you happier because it actually matches the rest of the d√©cor.
 Box it up if you can, so you won't see the item, and give it to someone else before you can change your mind.
 Write the date on the box and mark it "Give away on (date)". Then when that day comes, don't even open the box. Give it to your choice of local charities (Goodwill, etc.) and let it go without thinking about it any more.
 Keep it out somewhere in plain view - e.g. if it's an item of clothing, hang it on your wardrobe door. Once you realise you've seen it every day for a week/ month and haven't wanted to use it, it'll be much easier to part with.
 It's easy to become attached to items, and learning to detach yourself from "stuff" takes time. Keep at it and you'll discover it becomes easier and easier to do.
