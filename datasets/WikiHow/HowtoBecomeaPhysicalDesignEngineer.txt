 Those considering entering this field must have strong aptitudes in critical thinking, reasoning and analysis as well as skills in working with advanced technologies.;
, Physical design engineers work with computers in the production and analysis of designs, conducting simulation tests and generating complex specifications.
 If you are currently a high school student you must include specific coursework in your curriculum in preparation for college level training.
 Additional coursework to round out your education while in high school should incorporate social studies, humanities and English.
 It is important to select training programs from schools that are accredited.
 Most of these organizations can provide you with additional resources that can be especially helpful if you are considering specializing in a particular area of physical design engineering.
 Membership will give you the opportunity to network with others already working in the engineering field through online discussion boards and blogs. You will be able to learn more about the profession, ask questions and get answers.
 Meet with and talk to guidance counselors to review admission requirements. Some schools require that applicants take specific entry examinations depending on the region where you live.
 Remember to choose a college or university that is accredited. Depending on admission requirements and openings, you may want to apply to more than one school

, As an example, do you want to be a mechanical engineer or an electrical engineer or specialize in a different area?

, You will not only learn more about physical design engineering but you will gain valuable knowledge and skills as well.
