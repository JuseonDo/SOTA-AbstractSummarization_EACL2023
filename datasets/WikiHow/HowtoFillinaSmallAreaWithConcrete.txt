you will need to dig the area out to a depth of about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm).

@summary
,

@summary
compact the soil below.

@summary
form the area by using 2 x 4's on their side, thus creating a box or shape that the concrete will be placed.

@summary
mix the pre-mixed concrete (the bags that say "just add water") in a wheelbarrow.

@summary
pour the concrete into the area, and use another 2 x 4 to screed or rod the cement.

@summary
take a mag-float, this looks like a regular concrete float, but it is thicker and made of wood, or magnesium.

@summary
wait until the surface is free of stagnant water and it looks somewhat dry.

, Use a dirt tamper. Make sure the area has no puddles before you pour the concrete., If there is a natural border i.e. concrete around, or other type of framing, you will not need to build the form. Use wooden stakes to secure the forms. Use duplex nails to nail the stakes to the outside of the forms. Duplex nails are made in such a way that they can easily be pulled out once your concrete cures., Slowly add water to the mix and stir frequently. Make sure you leave some concrete available in case you make the mix too wet. If you do, just add some more concrete. The consistency of the mix should feel like clay that you can mould., Place the 2 x 4 on it's side and with the 2 x 4 resting on the edges of your forms slowly pull the screed board toward you filling in the area, and leaving it nice a level to the forms., Use this to slowly float the cement causing the pores to close., Now take a steel float and smooth out the surface.
