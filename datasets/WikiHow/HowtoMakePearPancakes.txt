 Beginning at the bottom, slice pears sloping into 1/8-inch-thick rings, and throw them in a small bowl with maple syrup and cinnamon.;
, Brush with butter; wipe off the surplus butter with a folded paper towel. Place a few pear slices on the griddle, 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) apart. Let cook 1 minute. Dip about 1/4 cup of the batter into center of each pear ring.
 Let them cook until pancakes have bubbles on top and are slightly dry around the edges, for about 2 1/2 minutes.
 Keep repeating the same routine with remaining pears and batter.
