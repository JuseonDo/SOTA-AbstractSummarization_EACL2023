720p is the resolution for screens that have rows of 1280 by 720 pixels on the screen, regardless of the TV size. High definition cable and satellite channels, as well as more advanced DVD players, use this resolution.
1080p is the resolution for screens that have rows of 1920 by 1080 pixels on the screen, and is mainly used for Blu-ray, although Blu-ray players can also deliver content in 720p for TVs that do not have a 1080p input.
