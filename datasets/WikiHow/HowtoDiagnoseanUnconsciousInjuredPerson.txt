If you are talking to family, or someone who knows the victim, try to get as much medical history as possible. Find out if the person is pregnant, has a pacemaker, etc.;
, If you start feeling unwell, have multiple unconscious victims, or bystanders start to feel unwell, consider an environmental toxin such as carbon monoxide.
, The condition listed could be considered a possible cause.
 Pay attention to the climate of a place. Is it extremely hot or cold where the victim is? Heat stroke or hypothermia could have made the victim pass out.


Finding empty, or partially empty, alcohol bottles, pill bottles or a needle can indicate a possible overdose. Seeing a ladder close to the victim or electrical tools can mean the victim might have fallen or been electrocuted.
 Strange smells can indicate toxins or a medical condition such as in diabetes.

 This can include swelling, redness or lines around a wound.
 If the person is older, a heart attack or stroke may be the cause of the victim's collapse.
