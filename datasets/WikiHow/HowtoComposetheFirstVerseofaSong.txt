,, Put either the verse or the chorus first.
 If you want to write a song about love try to think of that feeling of having heartbreak, or falling in love.
, It is sometimes more productive if you work backward. Let's say the song is about a person messing around with your best friend - if you start from the end, start with a sad scene. For instance: "Trapped in time, and I don't know what to do/These friends of mine, I can see right through/You don't got to tell me, I know what to do/I'm just sitting' back here, sharing' in the groove" Written by Mike Gordon and performed by Phish.
