 The zoom tool is your friend. Just press "+" or click the magnifying glass icon to zoom in and press "-" to zoom out.;
, Mentally divide the object into smaller objects. For example, if you were drawing a mug, you would divide it into the opening, the body, and the handle.
, Getting the exact shape right is the most difficult part of pixeling.
 You many need to use more shades depending on how smooth your object is. You can "create" these shades using the smudge tool, if necessary.

 Repeat this step until everything looks perfect.
 Enjoy your small mug.
