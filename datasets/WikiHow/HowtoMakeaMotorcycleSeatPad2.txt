, The rear edge of the memory foam should touch the front of the hump where the seat slopes upward.
, Using the marker and a ruler to keep the lines straight, extend the lines to the edge of the seat on 1 side.
 Cut just inside the 2 lines you extended to the seat edge. Cut to a depth of 1 inch.
 Cut to a depth of 1 inch. Remember to cut just inside the lines.
 One section will conform to the measurements of the memory foam. The other, smaller section will measure approximately 4 inches by 1 inch (10 cm by 2.5 cm). One side of the smaller section will be narrower because it conforms to the angle of the seat edge.


Switch off the electric knife and plunge it into the cut you made to the back of the outline. This is the extended line that touches where the seat's hump slopes upward.
Turn the knife sideways so the serrated blade is horizontal and facing forward.
Power on the electric knife and cut while gliding the knife forward until you reach the front line. This will excise the 2 sections of foam out of the seat.
