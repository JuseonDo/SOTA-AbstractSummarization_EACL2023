 The number of cookies you want to make is totally up to you, just make sure that you don't make too few or too many. Alternatively, you can draw 1 huge cookie.;
, Color them in. It's OK to be a little messy as long as they look like they are made with love (probably like the cookies your mom bakes, too.)

, Leave the back blank for messages. They should look like real cookies now.
 If you want, you can color in the back with a very light pencil like yellow or peach, but if you want to keep it white that is fine. White, anyway, is better for magic markers if you will be using them.
 Say why you love her or what this cookie is for. For example, you could write "I love my mom because she is great at cooking my favorite foods" or "This cookie is for all the love you give me." Repeat with the other cookies, just use different phrases or messages this time. If you have just one big cookie, list multiple reasons.


You could say you love her because...
She is beautiful
She is a great cook
She is always there for you when you need someone to talk to
She always loves you the most in the world
She never gives up
She is your inspiration

, You can write a little card or message to really make them look well presented. If you wish, you can also wrap them up in ribbon to make them look pretty.
 Once she does, let her read them by herself, and give her a big hug afterwards. She will really appreciate the effort.
