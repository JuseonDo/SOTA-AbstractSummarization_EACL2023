 Warm the half and half until it starts to simmer and bubble a bit.
 Turn it on right away. Slowly and carefully pour the steaming half and half liquid to the yellow egg yolk mixture while the processor is blending.


Be very careful when pouring the half and half liquid, as it will be hot and may splatter around. Try wearing a shirt with sleeves and wear oven mitts on your hands.
 Start cooking it over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon frequently until it starts to thicken up.
 Stir in the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and elbows or macaroni pasta until well combined.
 Refrigerate for ten minutes or until it completely cools off.
 Once the ice cream concoction has solidified, place the macaroni ice cream into a container and let it freeze overnight.


Make sure the container you are using is freezer-proof and/or will not be damaged in the freezing process. It should also be large enough to hold all of your ice cream.
 Let it sit for ten minutes so it can soften a bit.
 To do so, make the apricot sauce, then drizzle it across your ice cream using a fork.
, Heat the apricot preserves in the microwave on high power for thirty seconds.
 Add the Sriracha and chili powder. Stir again.
 Set it aside, and use it as a topping for your macaroni and cheese ice cream.
