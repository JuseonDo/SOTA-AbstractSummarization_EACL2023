 If you bought a game, game case, a case for your DS, or any other thing that's in the box, take it out. Your charger charges your game system, by plugging it into the wall socket.
 Turn the power switch on and a white screen should come up. Click on it with your stylus (if you don't have one press A), and you will have to enter your name and pick a color for a program called PictoChat. In this program you can chat with people, but not that far away.
 That should be all of the options unless there is one more. Go back to the main screen, and click to continue. At the top, tap on the name of your game and you will start playing. You probably have to make a file to start. Your game will start to play. Have fun!

, The side buttons are to control the music. Put a game into the slot if you are planning to play a game.;
,, Select what thing you want to do and have a blast!
