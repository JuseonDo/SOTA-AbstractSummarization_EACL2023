 Even plants that are in full sun can be overwatered.;
, If the leaves are light green or yellowed, it is a sign of overwatering. If the new growth is brown instead of green, this is a similar sign.
 If there aren’t any drainage holes, then it is very likely that the plant is suffering from overwatering, since the excess water just sits in the pot, drowning the roots. You will need to get a new, well-drained pot to save it.
 Look for green soil, which is actually algae growing in the overabundance of water. You will need to buy new soil.
 These are signs the plant has started to die due to overwatering., An overwatered plant can’t hydrate its upper extremities. Although the plant will dry more slowly, it will keep the plant from being too stressed.
 Gently grab on the top of the soil or the plant and lift it out.
 Placing it on top of a wire mesh baking rack will allow air to dry out the roots for a while. Note if the roots are brown. Healthy roots should be white.
 Place some gravel or plant mesh at the bottom to give the plant even more room to drain.
 Throw this soil in the trash so that it isn’t used again.
 If they are starting to smell and decompose into a compost-like material, you will need to prune them away before repotting. Only prune what is definitely diseased and/or rotting.,, It will help them to get some water, without overwatering the soil.
 Put a saucer under the pot to catch excess water.
 Don’t wait so long that the soil is completely dry, or you may shock the plant. Test the surface each time before you water.
 The root system needs to be healthy to absorb these nutrients. Also, fertilizer can burn unhealthy roots., This will help give the plant more nutrients as it recovers.
