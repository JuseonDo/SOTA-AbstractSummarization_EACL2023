 Clean your room, bathroom, and any places your friend will see. Hide anything you don't want your friend to know about, like your secret diary or something that makes you embarrassed. Then make sure you have a place for them to sleep.;
, Activities like makeovers, running around in the dark with glow sticks, eating a late night snack, or playing with pets. Don't stick to these activities, just make sure you have a backup plan if you and your friend get bored.
 Ask what they brought.
 Play games, go on Facebook, do each other's make-up, bake something, make a video and post it on YouTube, or anything that sounds fun. Don't do anything too inappropriate without a trusted adult's permission.
 If she did, find her one to use for the night.
 Unless you want to sleep the whole next day or your parents don't mind two cranky preteen girls to deal with the next day.
 Make your bed, put your friend's bed away, and pick up anything you left on the floor.
 Make cinnamon rolls, pancakes, waffles, or just have cereal. Make sure you have plenty of choice.
, Otherwise, you'll have to clean it up yourself, and that's no fun.
 Especially if it's something important, like her cellphone.
