,, (After this the screen will appear dark and will show a bunch of computer codes. Don't be afraid, this will only go on for a little while. Just make sure no one else comes in when the screen is like that).


Then it will go to the account/login screen

,,, If not, then type in Net User.
 Pick which one you want to hack.

Let's say on that computer the accounts are named Bob, Nate, and Pat. If you pick Bob then simply type in:net user Bob *






After this it will tell you to type a new password






When you are typing, it will appear as if you aren't typing anything. Don't worry, this is for security reasons. Just make SURE that you spell it correctly.
 After you are finished it will ask you to confirm the new password.


After this shutdown the computer and then start it up again.
, you have hacked a windows account! Have fun!
