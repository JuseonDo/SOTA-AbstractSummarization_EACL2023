, Example: Should you invite one side of the family or both?

, Gluten free (to cater for coeliacs) and vegan foods are the safest, but don't worry to much about catering for others eating habits. Make certain all food is well cooked or grilled (you don't want food poisoning).
 Summer is always good, but people may be on holidays abroad. The best thing to do would be to have it inside-the weather is too unpredictable - but if you're having it inside make sure it's a big venue!

, dates to everyone that you want to invite. You need to know how many people are coming.
 Nothing too fancy,just try pretty tablecloths and flowers!

, I've seen teens being forced to play charades before. Not a pretty sight. The best thing to do would be just to encourage conversation, eating, dancing, or an activity that everyone can enjoy. You don't want 7 year old Jordon shouting, "Dylan won't let me play on the Wii!"

, Keep in mind that there will be seat swapping. One of the joys of being assigned a seat.
