Note that Lyft’s payments are processed by Stripe, which is a well-secured payment platform. Hence, your credit card information will remain completely safe and hacker-proof with Lyft.
 At the moment, the Lyft app does not allow you to delete a payment method, if you have only one. So, you cannot entirely delete your current credit card. However, you can delete an old card after adding a new one. For more information, you can contact Lyft support.


Alternatively, you can contact your credit card company to cancel your credit card account on Lyft.
