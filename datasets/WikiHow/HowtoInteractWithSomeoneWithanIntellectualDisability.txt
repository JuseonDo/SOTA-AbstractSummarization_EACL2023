 They may not be able to respond, or they may just walk away, but this is okay. It's important to not lose hope if at first you can't establish a connection (as is the same with other people you may meet), however, if they act particularly frightened or are made uncomfortable, don't pressure them to respond to you. Perhaps try a different approach.;
, Reach out by eating lunch or speaking with them. Again, do not pressure them into doing things. This should help them to get comfortable with you.
 Even if it may seem like a good idea to be helpful with their job, keep in mind that your boss / their boss may not appreciate you detracting from your own work to assist them with theirs. Also know that the disabled person in question may feel that they are being put down by your altruistic efforts, or drawing attention to their disability.
 Many people with disabilities will not feel comfortable in social situations.
 Instead, tell them "it's okay!" and help them correct it. After all they need someone who can understand them.
 They are capable adults, and even if they have some learning or mental disabilities, they should be treated as adults.
 Don't take away their work or learning experiences unless they explicitly ask you for help. Don't treat them like they are incompetent. They can hear everything you say, they just have a different way of talking or being, because of their disorder.
