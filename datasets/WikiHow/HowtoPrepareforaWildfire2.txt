 Don't assume that someone else has already called. Describe the location of the fire, speak slowly and clearly, and answer any questions asked by the dispatcher.
 Anyone with medical or physical limitations and the young and the elderly should be evacuated immediately.
 Wear sturdy shoes, cotton or woolen clothing, long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, and a handkerchief to protect your face.
 Clear items that will burn from around the house, including wood piles, lawn furniture, barbecue grills, tarp coverings, etc. Move them outside of your defensible space.
 Close outside attic, eaves and basement vents, windows, doors, pet doors, etc. Remove flammable drapes and curtains. Close all shutters, blinds or heavy non-combustible window coverings to reduce radiant heat.
 Close all doors inside the house to prevent draft.
, Shut off any natural gas, propane or fuel oil supplies at the source.
 If you have gas-powered pumps for water, make sure they are fueled and ready. This may help firefighters put out fires in your home.
