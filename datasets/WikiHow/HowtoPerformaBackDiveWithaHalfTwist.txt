@summary
unless you are very comfortable with this dive, do not attempt to tuck or pike.

@summary
when you are completely vertical, (but upside-down over the water,) you're ready to twist.

,,,, You don't want to jump straight up if you are on a recreational diving board, because then you will hit the board on your way down. If you are on a real diving board, then it works best if you jump straight up. However, you also don't want to jump straight back. Try jumping as high as you can in the air and about two to three feet back, depending on how tall you are.
 Layout is the easiest to twist, but it takes the most effort to complete the flip.
 For a layout, once you are in the air, tuck your chin to your chest and focus on pulling in your stomach muscles and straightening your back, helping your feet go over your head.
 If you are a lefty, snap your right arm down towards your left hip, keeping your left arm straight. As your arm turns, turn your hips. The turn will be completed. If you are a righty, snap your left arm down towards your right hip, keeping your right arm straight. As for lefties, your hips should turn with you arms and your turn will be completed.
 Make sure both arms are by your ears. You can untuck your chin now. Enter the water with your arms down, your toes pointed, and a big smile!
