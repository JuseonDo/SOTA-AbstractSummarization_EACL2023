  Deseed your pepper and remove the stem.  Slice the pepper in half using your knife. Cut those halves in to strips, and cut those strips into dices.  Place aside.;
, Using your knife, cut the ends of the zucchini off and grate in the cheese grater. Place aside.
 To your beef, add the soy and oyster sauce and mix. Be careful not to knead the meat, otherwise you may make the proteins in the meat stick, causing lumps. If you can't not knead, use a fork. Place aside.
, Don't be too generous though, especially when using a non-stick frypan.
 Put your an on high to heat the pan and oil. Wait for approx. 2-3 mins.
 Put the onion in the pan and keep them moving with your egg-flipper. You can tell they are finished when they have browned and start producing liquid.
 Break up the pieces with your flipper quickly as they cook. This will take about 5-7 mins but keep an eye on it.
 At this point you can add more sauce(s). Continue cooking until the capsicum has gone soft.
, Be careful not to burn yourself.
 Your San Choy Bau is ready to serve!
