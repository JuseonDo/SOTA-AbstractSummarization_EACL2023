, If you don't like mustard, then simply use more butter instead.Make sure that the butter is at room temperature, however; this will make it easier to spread.


If you can't find any Dijon mustard, you can use regular mustard instead.
For extra flavor, use salted butter., For extra flavor and crunch, you can add some slicked cornichons as well.
 This will "seal" the sandwich and help keep it together. Don't press down so hard that the crust cracks, however., If the sandwiches are not holding together, you can stick a sandwich/club frill toothpick down the center of each one.
 If you won't be eating them right away, you can wrap them up tightly with plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge for the next day.
