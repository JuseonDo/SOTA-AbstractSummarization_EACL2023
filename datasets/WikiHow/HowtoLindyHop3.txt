At this point, your follower won't know which basic you're intending to do, so once you've done the rockstep, exaggerate the motion of the next one.
 This is where you basically take three steps in two counts (three-four).


Try counting this as three-and-four and stepping on each of those words.
Leads should lead this as something of a downward motion to distinguish it from the Charleston basic.
You won't have time to do whole steps here, so don't try to. Keep them small and stay in time with the music.



You can step forwards, backwards, or on the spot, but the lead needs to make it clear to the follower which way they're stepping by leading with their whole body so the follow can follow.
In many ways, this is similar to the rockstep.
 For the basic step this should go backwards and you should end up more or less where you started.
