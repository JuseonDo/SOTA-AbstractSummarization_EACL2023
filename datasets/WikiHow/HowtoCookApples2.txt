 Wash and peel the apples first. Then, prepare them in one of the following ways:


Core the apples, then cut them into rings/slices.
Cut the apples into thin wedges.Cut the apples into quarters, then into Â½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices., Tilt the skillet from side-to-side as the butter melts to help it spread evenly across the bottom.
 You can use white or brown sugar, but brown sugar will give you a better flavor. Keep stirring until the sugar and cinnamon are mixed evenly with the butter.
, Scoop the apple slices out with a spoon, and serve them in a bowl. If you don't want the "sauce" leftover from the apples, scoop them out using a slotted spoon instead.
