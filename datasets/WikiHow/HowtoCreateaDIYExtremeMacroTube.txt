 (It is assumed that you keep a lens on it and aren't using it any longer). The hole should be big enough to let enough light in to the camera-body when taking a picture.


Better yet, get a cheap aftermarket body cap and cut that up, keeping your original body cap for protecting the body and possibly adding value if you sell it.






Be careful that the hole stays small enough so that the systems that locks the body cap on your camera body stays intact!

Try a short Pringles can for roughly 1:1 magnification (the picture covers an area about the size of a postage stamp); a long one for significantly greater magnification and more difficult use.
The hole must be a little smaller than the hole in the body cap, so that the body cap can fit perfectly on to the Pringles can.
,, Since the inside of the can is made of reflective material, you get nasty lighting on your pictures if you don't do this.
 Wrap a small piece of cloth around the lens, so that it fits snug into the can.
, Remember that because the lens itself isn't attached to your camera, you'll lose autofocus and aperture control. Focus by physically getting closer to or further away from the subject, and control the aperture manually by the lever on the lens.
