An encrypted document cannot be opened without supplying the password.






A password protection window will pop up with asterisks where the password was entered.

Click the "Tools" link from the save window and then select the "Save As" menu, which is at the bottom of the document.






Choose "General Options" from the menu.






Clear the passwords from all fields here and then click the "OK" button to close the window.
