 This should look like so: _\_/_. this is your waiter's tray, which is holding a drink.
, This is done by pressing (shift) ;, -, and (shift) 0. this should look like: :-) which Microsoft Office Word should automatically change into a head.
, Now, press (shift) 1. This makes an exclamation point which can be used as your waiter's tie. Now press enter for the last step.
 This will make your stick man's legs and shoes which should look like this: _/\_.
 Now keep one finger on the space bar, and one on the backspace key (but don't press them yet!) Now, start by pressing backspace, then press the space bar. Don't press the two buttons longer than you want him to dance!
