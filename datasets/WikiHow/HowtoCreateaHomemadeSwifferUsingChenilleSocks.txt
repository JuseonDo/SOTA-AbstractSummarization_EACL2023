 Because these handy devices come in a variety of sizes you will need socks that will fit. That means you may need to shop in the men’s department for the larger model or purchase extra stretchy socks.;
, Although one pair should give you two good cleanings, you may be one of those folks who aren’t fond of doing laundry every few days. If you need to clean your floors every day but don’t want to do laundry more than once or twice a week you should consider purchasing more than one pair of socks.
 While cotton may be nice, you want material that will attract and grab floor debris. A blend may not work as well as 100% chenille.
 Make sure any price stickers or tags have been fully removed so there is no interference while cleaning.
 You may need to stretch the sock mouth to fit over the base so stretch and mold as needed.
 If the sock becomes filled with debris and is no longer working as well, head to the trash and wipe your hand over the bottom to remove abundant hair or debris. Continue to use until finished.
 Avoid using fabric softener when washing the sock as fabric softener may reduce the chenille material power.


Consider removing excess debris from sock before adding it to the washing machine.
