 If you have another car in your garage, use that to win races and escape from the cops. Over time, your other car(s) will cool down. To cool them down faster, change their appearance. Change body kits, spoilers, roof scoops, rims, paint, vinyls etc. Anything but performance upgrades will cool your car down.;
, Try focusing on the acceleration more so if you have crashed into a lorry (or truck), you'll be able to pick up speed quicker. But don't increase the acceleration TOO much, or your top speed will probably only be 135mp/h!

, Use the good ol' back try strategy; If the cops are in front of you, spin them out of control by hitting their rear tyre.
 Otherwise the pursuit bar will quickly (and unrealistically) go to the 'Busted' side.
 However, if there aren't any, try making them crash into oncoming traffic (the big lorry/truck is the best one).
 If there aren't any near you, make your own one!

, Otherwise your tires will be busted and soon you will be too!
