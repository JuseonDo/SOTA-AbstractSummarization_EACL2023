 What to use? Read on and find out!

, Set up a few boxes in a circle, leaving an entrance for the teddies to get in. Take some plastic food, and set it up on the boxes according to food group. If you want, you can also have something like a Sweet Shop next door.
 Set it up in a row, and clamp some price tags on each one (stickers with Sharpie on them will do). Assign a bear to run the store.
 Get some pillows, and arrange them in a row (massage tables). Get a few extra chairs, and use those for salon chairs or pedicure seats. They could even be massage chairs! Now, you should assign about 3 teddies to be the Spa Workers.
 Get some more, and use those for normal table-beds. Now, you should assign 8 teddies to be doctors and nurses. You can use some empty medicine bottles as their medicine, but make sure they are EMPTY!

, Now, your teddies can buy some clothes!
