 You can export a 2D DWG, but be careful when importing 3D DWG data into Rhino 3.0 (no problem in Rhino 4.0) without using the 3.0 bonus tools. Check the units in Rhino under Tools-Options then either Import or Insert the DWG plan as a reference.Tip: You can use horse’s dimensioning tools to verify the scale of the DWG insert.;
, This is done simply by drawing a shape curve and a straight curve, then using the Extrude CurveAlong Curve tool to generate a surface between the curves. The surface can then be transformed into a solid using the Extrude Surface tool. You can import just the surface into Revit, but the flat surface will be difficult to visualize on-screen.
, You may have to adjust its XYZ location before finishing the mass which can be accomplished in plan or elevation.
 Pick the top or bottom face of the mass element.
