 In the hustle and bustle of a busy arcade, people often lose track of the odd penny. Good places to look that often yield are in between machines, under machines and even on top of machines where people may have left them. Also don't forget to check inside the coin collectors at the lower front of the machine where you collect the coins, you will almost always find some there.;

, You can determine this in a number of ways. First check to see the one with the most coins. That's the one with the most coins on the top layer and the bottom layer.
 It should pay out.
