 Place a small strainer over a cup and measure the matcha powder into it. Gently tap the side of the strainer to shake the matcha powder into the cup. This will get rid of any clumps and give you a smoother drink in the end.
 The water should be hot but not boiling, about 165 to 180°F (75 to 80°C). Briskly stir the tea using zigzag motions to make it frothy. Try to use a chasen (bamboo whisk) for this, but if you don't have one, a regular mini whisk will do.Keep whisking until all the powder is dissolved.
 You can do this using a milk frother on an espresso machine or in a saucepan on the stove. You can even do it in a cup in the microwave.Do not let the milk come to a boil; keep it between 165 to 180°F (75 to 80°C).
 You can do this by using a frother on an espresso machine.If you do not own an espresso machine, pour the milk into a separate cup and use a hand frother to froth it instead., Place a large spoon just inside the rim of the frothing cup to hold back the foam. You do not have to use all of the milk—pour in as much as you'd like.
 Reach into your frother cup and scoop out the foam with a spoon. Gently place the foam on top of the latte. If you'd like, you can add another scoop or two of foam. Spread it evenly across the top of the latte.
 If you wait too long, the matcha powder will settle to the bottom of the cup.
