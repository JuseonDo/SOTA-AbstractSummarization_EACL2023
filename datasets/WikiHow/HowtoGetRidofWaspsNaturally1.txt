 Put it close to the wasp nest on the ground. Obtain a cloth bag with a tie at the end and a large rock.


This cloth bag should be able to be tied tightly closed and should be big enough to hold the wasp nest. If you do not have a suitable cloth bag, you should pick another method to get rid of the wasps.;
, Stand close to the wasp nest, holding the cloth bag. Be careful not to move suddenly.
 Pull the wasp nest down onto the ground. It should be tied tightly and sealed so that the wasps inside the nest cannot get out.
 Put a rock over the cloth bag to keep it submerged. Eventually the wasps will drown.You can also put at least of a quarter of a cup of dishwashing detergent or soap into the bucket of water to further immobilize the wasps.
