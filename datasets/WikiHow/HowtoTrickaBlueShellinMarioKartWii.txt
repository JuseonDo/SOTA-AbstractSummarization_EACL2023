 Let the person in second place get ahead of you, but not too far ahead.;

,, This is definitely not the best option, but it can save you from being laughed at by your friends.
 It's recommend you hit a Green Shell, as this won't take as much damage. Bananas are also very good objects to hit, as you just spin (make sure it's not near a cliff!). Chain Chomps and Bowser Shells get the job done, but take much more damage. A Chain Chomp knocks you to the side, and this can be hazardous on tight stages. A Bowser Shell flattens you, making it easy for players to jostle you around.
