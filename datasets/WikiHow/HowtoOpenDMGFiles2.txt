 Since DMG files are formatted for Macs, there is no built-in way to open them in Windows. You will need a third-party program to be able to view their contents.

If you're trying to install a program using the DMG file, you'll need to download the Windows installer instead. Programs from DMG files cannot be installed in Windows.
 There are several programs that can open DMG files so that you can see what's inside. The most popular free options is HFSExplorer. You can get it from catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/.


During the setup process, make sure to check the "Register .dmg file association" box so that DMG files open in HFSExplorer.
 If you associated DMG files with HFSExplorer during installation, HFSExplorer should open automatically when you double-click the DMG file.


If HFSExplorer doesn't open, drag the DMG file onto the HFSExplorer icon.
 After the DMG file opens in HFSExplorer, you will be shown all of the files and folders it contains. Select any file(s) that you want to extract.
 This will copy any files that you've selected from the DMG file onto your computer. You will be prompted to select the location you want to save the file(s).
 You will be prompted to choose after clicking the "Extract" button. Selecting Yes will preserve the file structure of the DMG file after extracting, but will lead to more space taken and the extraction process will be longer.
 This may take a while for larger files. Once the extraction is complete, you can start using the extracted files.


Since DMG files are Mac-formatted, there's a very good chance that all of the included files will also be Mac-formatted. Your options for manipulating these files may be severely limited.
