There are no penalty fees for changing a reservation.
You may be required to pay the difference in cost if your new, updated ticket has a higher rate. For example, if you paid 250 dollars (176 euros) for your original ticket, but the ticket for your new reservation costs 300 dollars (212 euros), you be will required to pay the difference of 50 dollars (35.29 euros).



You can upgrade or downgrade to and from First Class, or make Amtrak sleeping arrangements.
If you are modifying First Class or Sleeping Car reservations, you must provide advanced notices of 1 hour, or 7 days, respectively. You will be required to pay penalties or for the full price of the extra accommodations if you do not change your reservations within the advanced notice time-frames.



For example, if you have decided to bring a car instead of a motorcycle, you will need to notify Amtrak to reserve extra room for your automobile.
