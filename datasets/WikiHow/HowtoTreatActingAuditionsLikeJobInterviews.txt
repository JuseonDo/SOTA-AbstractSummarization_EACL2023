 Just like a job interview, you are applying for a specific position so you want to make sure that you are able to fill the part accordingly. Equally, you should also learn as much as you can about the casting company you are auditioning for.;
, If necessary, brush up on your skills while you continue to search for work by attending acting workshops.
 As with a regular job interview, a resume gives a brief explanation of your talents and experience, and it should entice an employer, creating the desire to learn more.
 This means taking part in local productions and smaller acting parts.
 You want some time to read through the reading and establish the manner in which you will perform it.
 Auditions are like job interviews and you don't have to dress in costume or an obnoxious outfit in the hopes of leaving an impression. Doing so may instead be a distraction and defeat the purpose of the casting crew focusing on your ability to act.
 With auditions and job interviews alike, you want to demonstrate that you can do the job, not exhibit that you are full of hot air.
 Just don't overdo it as this can be annoying and turn the casting crew off. The idea is that you want them to recognize that you are eager to give them what they want and that you can be directed easily.
 Just like an interview you have the opportunity to show the casting directors that you are capable of performing a part.
