You may want to print out the trade-in offers page for later use.
 Bring that trade in offers page you printed out. The creator of the website may have been negligent and forgot to add "cannot combine with other offers". You cannot do this if there is something along those lines in a terms or policies section, which i don't know offhand.
 this will get you a 10% bonus on trade-ins.
