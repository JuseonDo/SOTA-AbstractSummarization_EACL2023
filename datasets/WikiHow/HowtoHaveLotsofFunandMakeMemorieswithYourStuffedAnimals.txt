 Build-a-bear and the bear factory are great places to start! There are many different stuffed animals to choose from so, how do you choose? Look closely at the stuffed animal you want to choose. Each stuffed animal is different. Some have their eyes lower and some have stiffer bodies. Others have fine fur or shaggy fur. Choose the one you want to keep for a long time. Decide what type of animal you want, jungle stuffed animal, marine, forest or something else.;
, A suggestion is to have two normal outfits, pajamas, a fun outfit such as a ballerina, cheerleader, popstar etc, and a fancy outfit.
 Your name can be a real name such as Nicholas or a made up name like Sweetie. Your animal's name is important make sure to choose it a perfect name. Here are some examples:For a girl stuffed animal: Violet, Marissa, Caroline, Lauren, Sparkle, Pinky, Rachel, Rainbow, Abby. For a boy stuffed animal: Jackson, Nick, Cameron, Leo, Dino, Fuzzy, Gold, Charles, Kayden

, Tell them about each person or animal.
 Find a spot in your home to make a room for your animal. To make a bed cover a cardboard box in fabric or you can buy a bed. To make a nightstand place a small box next to the bed and put little trinkets on it. Fabric laid on the floor can be a carpet. Find little toys for your animals like mini stuffed animals, action figures, and mini toys.
 You can feed your animal fake food or pretend to feed them real food! Feed 3 times a day!

,,, You can also sleep with your animal if you would like.
 Play school with your soft toy if you wish.
 To make a mini party bring your friends or other stuffed animals to celebrate. Put on some music, play some party games, and have snacks.
 This will prevent your animal getting dirty.
