, Usually, we can categorize our skin tone in two ways: warm and cool. Check which type you possess by having a glimpse at the base of your arm during hours of daylight. Here is how to identify the tone of your skin and pick the best suited shades accordingly:


Warm Skin Tone: Yellow undertone with greenish veins. Those having warm skin tone should go for golden-based frames. Yellow, brown, red, ivory, orange, olive, etc. would also be good choices for you.
Cool Skin Tone: Rosy undertone with bluish veins. Sunglasses having blue-based frames are the best for people of cool skin tone. Some other hues that would work great for you are green, black, grey, pink, silver, purple, etc.
 We can just divide them into fair, wheatish, peach, dark, etc. and there is no need of checking the undertone for this purpose. It is simple to select the right pair of sunglasses depending on such classification and the following list will made your task even much easier.
 Pick some cool eye-wear designs in bright hues like red, orange, green, blue, yellow, etc. These would make you look fashionable and also appeal to the essence of your natural skin tone at the same time.
 From serious dark shades to peppy bright tints, you can go for any sort of frame or lens. We will recommend you to choose something from black, deep blue, purple, dark red, brown, etc.
 People with a peach skin tone can wear a wide range of shades. However, pastels and their varieties suit them the most. A few wonderful choices for peach-skinned people are grey, chocolate brown, beige, olive green, etc.
 Light-colored frames and lenses can boost your appearance greatly. So, you must stick to black, brown or golden sunglasses to look your best.
