 The size of your bottle will determine the size of your volcano.;
, Cut out all the sides except 1, which you will use to support your bottle.
 Add some cardboard supports to make the bottle as sturdy as possible.


Cut out several strips of cardboard that are 3 inches by 6 inches (7.5 by 15cm) for the supports.
Tape them with masking tape, electrical tape or duct tape. Avoid packing tape because it is too slick.
 Combine 6 cups (0.75kg) of flour, 2 cups (0.58kg) of salt, 2 cups (0.47l) of water and 4 tbsp. (59ml) of cooking oil.


Use your hands to knead the dough until smooth.
 Allow it to dry once the volcano is sculpted.



For example, you may want to paint the volcano brown with green near the bottom.
Illustrate the eruption by painting red lava flows down the side. , Add 2 tbsp. (28g) of baking soda.
 (4.9ml) of dish soap, 1 oz. (29.6ml) of vinegar and several drops of red and yellow food coloring in a separate container.
 Pour in the vinegar mixture. Wait and watch as the vinegar and baking soda combine to form carbonic acid.
 Empty it and start again.
