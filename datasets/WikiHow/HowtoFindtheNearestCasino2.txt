While watching television, pay close attention to any advertisements that mention casinos.
Note the location that is mentioned in each advertisement that involves a casino.
If no location is mentioned, note any additional contact information, such as a website or phone number. Use that information to find out where the casino is.



If you learn about more than 1 casino on television, use the Internet to search the distance between your location and each casino. Sites such as maps.google.com or mapquest.com will help you in this search.
