 To husk the corn, just grab it at the top of the ear where you see the silks (the dark, hair-like strands) and pull it all the way down the corn.
 Place them in a colander and run cold water over them to remove any dirt.
 The foil should be big enough to be completely wrapped around the corn.
 Use a brush to cover the foil with 3 tablespoon (44.4Â ml). of melted unsalted butter.
 Add enough salt and pepper to the butter to suit your tastes.
,, Add more butter, salt, or pepper, if you like.
