 The amount of selenium in the product is largely determined by the amount of selenium in the soil it was grown in. Therefore, if you only eat products that you grow in your yard and your soil is not high in selenium, the selenium level in your body might be low.


The more volcanic ash in the soil, the higher the selenium content. Soil that is irrigated by sea water is also high in selenium.
Generally speaking, soil in the eastern part of the United States has less selenium than soil in the western part.;
, These products also have higher levels of vitamin E and beta carotene, both of which help selenium in its battle against free radicals.
 Brazil nuts have the highest concentration of selenium of all foods. The selenium content is approximately 50 micrograms per nut, depending on the size of the nut and the soil in which it grew; therefore it is not a good idea to eat more than two a day for an extended period of time.
 The best choices for selenium are:


White flesh fish
Tuna fish
Salmon
Oysters
Shrimp

, Processing the grain into white flour strips the grain of most of its nutrients, including selenium. Some good grain choices include:


Brown Rice
Wheat germ
Oats
Barley

,, You should never take a selenium supplement unless under a doctor's supervision because there is a risk of toxicity from too much selenium.
