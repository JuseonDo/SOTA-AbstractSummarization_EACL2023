 Tell her that you're flattered that she seems to to like you but that you're not in a place to date anyone right now. Help her to understand that this means you're busy and emotionally unavailable. Some good excuses include:


"I'm really focused in work/sport's try outs, etc., right now"
"School comes first".;
, Hopefully she'll leave you alone. If she does not, continue with the remaining steps.
 Whenever she tries to come near you, pretend like you cannot see her there and talk right through her to your buddies. This might break her heart, but that's what you want right?

, A smile will always be interpreted as encouragement.
 Never answer her messages, not even to say you're not interested; that's an acknowledgment of reading it and that gives her too big an angle.
 This will increase her hope and it will be too easy to put a false slant on your enthusiasm.
 If she persists and seems nice enough, match her with someone else!
