 Remove them from the oven when they're fragrant.
 Place the ancho and papilla peppers in a large bowl and pour 2 cups of hot or boiling water over the peppers. Let the peppers soak for about half an hour. They're ready for the next step when they've become soft and pliable. Tug at one of the stems; if it loosens easily, the peppers are ready.
 Remove the stems from the peppers. Slice them lengthwise and scrape out all of the seeds. Place the peppers back into the bowl with the water, which now holds a lot of the peppers' flavor.
 Put them in the blender, along with the water, and blend on high until you have a smooth paste.
