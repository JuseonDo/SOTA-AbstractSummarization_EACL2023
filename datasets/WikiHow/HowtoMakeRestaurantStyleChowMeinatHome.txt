 Cook on high until 90% done.;
,, Add 1/4 cup oil and, with the help of a fork, toss until noodles are coated. This will insure your chow mein remains non-sticky.



It's important to not forget to cover bowl with a lid or plastic wrap or it may freeze through. At this time we only want it cold not frozen.



Add chicken and brown on all sides for a minute or two. You don't need to cook the chicken all the way through at this point.
Then add the remaining veggies.
 Stir the vegetables and chicken until coated.
,,


Add remaining 2 tsp oil, soya sauce, red chilli sauce, tomato sauce, salt, white vinegar, ajinomoto (MSG), and black pepper powder to taste and stir until incorporated throughout.
 Continue to stir-fry for 3-5 about minutes or until chicken is cooked through, veggies are hot but still crispy and noodles are al dent√©.
 Your Chicken Chow Mein is ready to serve.
