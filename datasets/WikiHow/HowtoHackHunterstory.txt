 No, it does not mean what you think it means; it's just something the creator wanted to make because he thought it was funny. He could've had it created as "bunnies.sol" or "folder.sol" or "crovy.sol" etc. ---->Coming back, click on it and you should get the Sol Editor program, with your Hunterstory character stats on the left.
 Recommended to edit: skillpoints, bowwindup, level, mp, mprecov, dex, watk, and mesos. All of these edit the basic things.
 (located at the top of your character stats) Keep the Sol Editor open, and go back to the window where you opened Hunterstory, and go back to the game. You should now have the edited stats, edited to your character!
