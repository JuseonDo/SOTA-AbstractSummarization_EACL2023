Usually, the hockey goal half circle can be used in most ice rinks.
Only if the ice arena allows it, you may be able to draw a half circle on the ice instead

It is very important not to look down as it can cause you to lose your balance.



Your arms should be parallel to the ice.



Make sure that you push your foot back with enough force to give you speed
Without proper speed, you will not be able to complete the 3-turn across the entire half circle
It is important that to keep posture during this to avoid "slipping".



This is essential to make sure that your toe-pick does not get caught on the ice.
 Make sure to keep the left knee bent.


This should be making your left skate slide forward on curve directed towards the right.
 This should make you turn backwards.


In order to do this correctly, left knee must be bent slightly.



Normally, this makes you skate smoothly on a curve.
 This indicates leaning on the right side of your left blade. This will keep the skate on the curved path intended.


Allow flow on ice once all steps are put together. At the end, a half circle shaped like a 3 will show on the ice.
