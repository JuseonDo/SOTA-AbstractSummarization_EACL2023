 Using a bread or a serrated knife, make little indents in the loaf to make your bun. Cut into the loaf, about halfway, on both ends and cut across to get the piece out. You should have a long "top" loaf piece and a "U" shape in your loaf. Keep the piece you cut out.;
, You can cut and trim off any excess hanging off or leave it as is if you prefer it to extend off of the bun.
 You can also take them out of the loaf to frost the sides and bottom. Place them back in the "bun".
 This will represent the ketchup.
 This will represent the mustard.
 This will be the relish.
 Cut both halves into long strips. These will be your fries, so drizzle some red icing on them.
