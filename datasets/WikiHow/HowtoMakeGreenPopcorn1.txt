, Stir to coat each kernel with mixture. This results in every piece of popcorn having the color and flavor cooked on it as it pops. Even out the kernels in the bottom of bowl.
 This should equate to about 1-2 seconds between pops. The time will vary depending on your microwave and bowl, so you may need some trial-and-error on the first batch or two to figure out how long it takes the popcorn to cook. If you cook it too long, it will burn, smoke and stink, so keep a close watch.
 Leave the unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl. This will keep it from sticking to the bottom of the bowl as it cools. There will be some of the cooked syrup mixture in the bottom of the bowl, along with some unpopped kernels.









If you turn the bowl upside down and dump the popcorn onto the baking sheet, those unpopped kernels will end up stuck to the popcorn. Nobody wants that.
 A resealable plastic bag works, too. However, it's best eaten within a couple of days.
