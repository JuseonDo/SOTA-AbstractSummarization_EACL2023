");
}
}





, The output will be Hello there !. Also it will clear the console before typing out the message., Once you understand how it works, you can use the same method in other contexts more easily.

First it inserts a new form-feed due to escape sequence "\f", thereby clearing the screen.
Then, it prints out the message : Hello there !
