 Use an eyelash brush or a clean mascara wand to gently brush them out every morning. Try to sleep on your back at night. This will cut down on the amount of time you need to spend every morning combing them out.
 Mascara applied to the base of the extensions usually ends up getting clumpy.


Do not curl your eyelashes before you apply mascara. This can pull the extensions out.
Avoid water-proof mascara completely. It’s too hard to remove.Do not wear oil-based mascara with eyelash extensions, as this can loosen the adhesive.
 Invest in a high quality remover that requires that you rub as little as possible. Use the makeup remover or pre-moistened wipes to completely remove your makeup every day. Avoid oil-based makeup removers, which can loosen the adhesive. Makeup must be removed very gently to avoid pulling off the extensions.
 If you lose any pieces very early on, try to use a bit of mascara to conceal the gaps. A touch up every three to four weeks will keep your extensions looking full and at their best. You can also do maintenance as needed, adding new pieces on as you lose the originals.
