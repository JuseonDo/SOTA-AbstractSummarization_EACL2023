 They have to be male and female if you want your Sims pregnant. But if you don't you can make 2 adult women or men.;
, When you make or buy your house and go to the family, then you will need to buy a hot tub.
 There is a cheat to make them like each other.
 Have a chat going so they won't feel awkward.
 Once they are comfortable, use the boy or girl and click on the other Sim. There will be options. Click "Woohoo" or "Try for a baby" then if it is your first time "Woohooing" then a mini-clip will come up.
