@summary
set your american girl doll against an area where it won't slip.

@summary
mark each ear lightly with a pencil.

@summary
using a thumbtack, slowly start pushing the sharp edge into the mark placed on the ear.

@summary
use a sewing pin to break through the vinyl if you have ended up with a dent instead of a hole.

@summary
evaluate the size of the holes using an earring.

@summary
enlarge the holes if needed.

@summary
keep evaluating the size of the hole you're making; it won't hold the earrings straight or look nice if you make it too big.

@summary
have your doll wear her new earrings frequently.

 This will protect it from messing up while you pierce the ears. It will also prove the job to be easier as well.;
, This will give you the outline of where you will put the piercing. If it is not even then simply erase and try again.
 Patiently wedge it in until it goes all the way through. If it is taking awhile, try twisting it whilst the tack is still on the mark.
 This should be enough to pierce the ear--then, enlarge the small sewing pin hole using the thumbtack.
 Your doll should be able to wear post earrings, especially very small studs to suit her small face. If the earrings go in and stay in, you are done!

, You will want to use a sharp item that does not make a mark. You could try a metal tapestry needle, an awl, a THIN nail, a metal skewer or corn holder from the kitchen, or many other items. Look around and see what you can find!

, When the hole is big enough for the earrings to go in and stay in, you're done!

, She will look prettier with the jewelry hiding the holes. The vinyl can also close back up a bit if she doesn't wear earrings for awhile, so you might have to go through the enlargement process again.
