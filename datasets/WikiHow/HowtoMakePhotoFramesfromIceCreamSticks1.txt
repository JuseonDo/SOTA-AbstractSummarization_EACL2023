 You will need 1 stick for each side of the frame. If you'd like a thicker frame, glue 2 sticks together to make a wide popsicle stick., Place 2 popsicle sticks down in front of you, vertically. Place a drop of glue onto the top and bottom of each stick. Lay 2 sticks across horizontally the vertical sticks to form a square.


The best glue to use is hot glue, because it dries fast. You can also use school glue or wood glue instead, but it will take a few hours to dry.
 Paint your frame using markers or acrylic paint. Let the frame dry, then decorate it further. You can write something on it, such as "Daddy and Me" or "I Love You Mommy." You can also glue things onto it, such as glitter, gemstones, or buttons. For more decorating ideas, click here.
 Photos can be precious, so it is best to use a photocopy instead of an original photo.
 Try to just a little bit inside the lines you drew. This way, your photo won't stick out from behind your frame.
 Gluing the photo will make it permanent. If you only tape the photo, however, you can take it out again later and change it out for another photo.
 Cut a piece of ribbon, about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long. Flip your frame over and place a drop of glue in the upper left and right corner. Press each end of the ribbon into each drop of glue. Let the glue dry, then hang your frame., Flip your frame over, and place a drop of glue on the top and bottom of your frame.
