Then start to run and switch to your 2h.
Click firebolt then click him twice as fast as you can. You'll cast and hit him with your 2h at the same time if you do it right. Your combo at 26 combat can be 120 96 in 1.5 seconds. That's 216 at 26 combat. You could hit it at 20 combat if you had 100 hp but this is if you have 350 constitution.
