 The computer receiving the connection from your Windows 7 computer should have one of the following operating systems installed: Windows 10, Windows 8.1 (Professional or Enterprise), Windows 7 (Professional, Home Premium Ultimate or Enterprise). , Open the control panel and select “System and Security.” Click “System.”

,, Toward the bottom of the panel, you’ll see several options for Remote Desktop.


Select “Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop” if you’re not sure of the version of Windows installed on the system that will be making a connection. Select “Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication” if both computers are running Windows 7. You’ll only see this option on a Windows 7 computer, so don’t panic if you don’t see it in another version.
