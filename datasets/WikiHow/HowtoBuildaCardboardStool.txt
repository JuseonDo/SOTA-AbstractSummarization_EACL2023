 This is needed so as form the cardboard into a triangle. For guidance in where to bend, see the bend lines provided in the image.;
, The slit at one end should be on the bottom corner, while the slit at the other end should be on the top corner. See the image for the precise locations of the slits. These slits allow for clipping into each other to form a locked triangle when folded in place.
 Fold the cardboard piece to make two triangles in exactly the same way. When done, you should have something that looks like the triangles in the image. Make a halfway cut at the arrow marks shown in the image, on both triangles.
 Refer to the image to help you with the over-locking.
,, By following the line you'd drawn in place, it should fit perfectly on your stool.
 Allow to try firmly.
 Sit on it gently and enjoy making your own easy furniture.
