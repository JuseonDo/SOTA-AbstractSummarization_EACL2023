the most important thing is to find a team with players you are comfortable with.

playing over a lan line is a must if you are preparing for a competitive tournament as playing over lan is completely different to playing over xbl.

broadly speaking, if you want to improve your halo 3 skills (especially in a team environment) mlg is unequivocally the best playlist to be playing (not squad battle... if you play that, you're heavy support >_<), not only is mlg at the forefront of competitive gaming on a global scale, but it runs the largest e-sports circuit in the world.

 If you don't get along with your teammates, then obviously you are not going to do very well.;
, There is no substitute for practice. With practice comes better team chemistry, better communication, better teamwork and team-shooting, better strategies etc.
 XBL is accessible and convenient which subsequently leads to more frequent and consistent practice online, however, there are latency issues which means that the game isn't as "precise" as it would be on a local area network and at a very high level of play 50-50 situations are always in favour of the connection host on live (unless of course you're playing squad battle in which case everyone will be warping everywhere due to lag). There's no reason why you can't improve your game hugely on live, but LAN experience is definitely important for tournament preparation.
 Competitive Halo is always calibrated to the MLG standard.
