repeat these for all positions, except when you come up from the port de bras on fifth position, go on relevé, which is on the ball of your foot, what people call, "on your tippy toes".

finish with plié relevés!,

 Warming up is going to take about twenty minutes.If you don't stretch you could pull a muscle. Warming up for dance class is one of the most important parts of the process.


OPTIONAL: Put on some classical ballet music to do the warm-up.;
, In first positions, which is where your legs are together and they are turned out, have your hand on the barre, and do a demi-plié, and then go back up. Then another demi, and then a full grande plié, going all the way down, and back up.
 Your arm either to the side or above you, go slowly down to floor, bending your back.
 Make sure as you come up, your arm and head are aligned.
,, First do coupé, then possé, the put your leg on the barre, and just bend your back and stretch your leg. Remember to point your foot on the barre. Plié your leg that is on the ground. Stay for 16 counts or seconds(same thing).


Rond de jambes, which is your toe on the floor, moving either on the outside of your body or the inside. Do some slow rond de jambes, then quick ones. As you end your rond de jambe, feel free to put a few battements here and there.
 16 in first position, 16 on the right leg with your left leg behind it in coupé, the same except on your left.
 As you grow into it, feel free to add more to your warm-up and stretches.
