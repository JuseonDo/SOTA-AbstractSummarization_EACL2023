 Most other shapes have difficulty wearing tiers, since they emphasize the hip and thigh. Rectangle shapes benefit from this, however, since tiers help create the appearance of curves.
 Bubble hems add a significant amount of poof along the hemline. If added to the lower thigh or knee area, this poof adds significant volume and curve to the hip and thigh.
