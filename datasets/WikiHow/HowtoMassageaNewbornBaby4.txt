 Some are more suited for massage than others. There are some that probably should be avoided. You will want to be sure to use anti-allergic oils and unscented oils until your baby is 3 months old.
 Natural oils such as almond oil work well while offering a pleasant scent. Fragrant oils such as lavender and vanilla can be added to fresh olive oil or vegetable oil.
