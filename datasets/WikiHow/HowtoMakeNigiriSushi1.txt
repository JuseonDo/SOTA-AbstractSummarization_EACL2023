 If you're not able to verify that it is of high quality, don't use it raw. Instead, grill, roast, or bake the fish before slicing., Avoid creating bulky or uneven cuts because the presentation of the fish is important., Having wet hands helps to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands as you work with it., Roll and squeeze it together until it rolls into a firm "log" sized rectangle.,, Hold the tuna and rice in your left hand and use two fingers from your right hand to press the fish downwards and shape it in a rounded rectangle.







You will need to rotate and flip the rice and fish slice to get the rounded shape, pressing the two fingers at the same time.
