 You may find the following types of rib:


Full slab of spare ribs. This cut is large, but contains a lot of extra bone, such as the rib tips and sternum. You will need to take into account that much of the weight you pay for will be thrown away because of the extra bones.
St. Louis rack. The butcher removes the rib tips and sternum portion, so that more of the cut you are buying is meaty. It is also more expensive.
Kansas City rack. The butcher removes rib tips, sternum and breast bone. This is the smallest rack and can be even more expensive per lb.;
, (453 g) of ribs per person. The bones mean that there is a lot less meat to go around than with other cuts of meat. Some people suggest 1.25 to 1.5 lbs. (566 to 680 g) per person.
 Most ribs are sold fresh, so it is better to wait to buy them until the day before you plan to cook them.
 They can season overnight.
 (20.7g) of smoked paprika, 2 tbsp.(16.2g) of ancho chile powder, 1.5 tbsp. (14g) of garlic powder, 1.5 tbsp. (10.8g) onion powder, 1 tbsp. (18g) salt and 1 tsp. (2.1g) cumin.
, Pat them dry with paper towels.
 Cut them in half, if you need them to be sectioned in order to fit in your oven.
, This side should have the most spices so that the flavor is absorbed into the meat.
, Place them in the refrigerator overnight to season.
 You have several options, depending upon how low the heat in your oven goes.


Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius). Cook 6 to 8 hours.
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). Cook the ribs for 5 to 6 hours.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (162 degrees Celsius). Cook the ribs for 3 to 4 hours.
, They should warm up slightly before going in the oven.
, Place aluminum foil over the top of the ribs.
 Set your timer for halfway through your total cook time.
 The meaty area between the bones should read 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius).
 Keep them at the temperature, if they are below 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Check them again in 45 minutes.
 Keep them in the oven at this temperature for 2 to 3 hours to tenderize.
 Set the oven to broil for 10 minutes to seal in the sauce.
 Let them cool for 5 minutes.
