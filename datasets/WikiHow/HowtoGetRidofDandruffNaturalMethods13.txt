 Wash your hair normally, then pour vinegar-water mixture carefully onto hair and scrub into your scalp. Take care not to let any get into your eyes. If you have psoriasis or any unhealed scratch or scab, it will burn (if it burns, just rinse the affected area with water).
 The vinegar smell will disappear once your hair is dry.
