 Were you murdered? Where were you murdered? Things like that. Then you can decide on color theme and also if you want any other items. When you have done that you're ready to move on;
, A prom queen dress. You can get one's that are really cheap in charity shops, no more than Â£20 / $40.
 If it's white add some dirt to it. Rip parts up and make it look really raging. You can also stick things onto it like twigs or broken bits of plastic, you could add a layer of glue to make it look shiny like glass, so it looks like you have been stabbed.
 Just remember to get ones that don't cost that much but look the part. You may also want to buy a banner saying 'Miss Prom Queen' or make one - it's easy to make one. Piece of material and a pen!!

, You could also put a head piece in there but stick it in wonky.
 Then get some black eyeliner and put a lot on your eyes to make you look really tired. Then finally add some BRIGHT red lipstick to make you really look the part. Add jewelry if you wish.
