,,, This is a very easy trick to teach. If you want more of a challenge once your rabbit has this down, try getting him to hold the position by holding the treat just out of reach and delaying its delivery. Start with a very small delay and gradually increase the time. Once you have the desired results, use treats only occasionally.
