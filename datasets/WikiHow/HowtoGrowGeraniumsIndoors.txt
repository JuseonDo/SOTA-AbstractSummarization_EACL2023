Make sure that the soil is well drained.
, If it is not very root bound, give it a slightly larger pot.



Window should be a west or south facing for best results. An east or north window will result in less to no blooms, but the plant will survive.
 You should only need to water your plant when the soil is completely dry or close to that point.



You can tell when leaves are ready to be removed by gently tugging them. If they come off, they are ready. If they do not, then wait a little longer. This will also work with the flower stalks.



Do not shade geranium.Give a bright, non-shaded window.
