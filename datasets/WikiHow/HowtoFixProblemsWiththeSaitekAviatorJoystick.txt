, Click on "Deadzones" and move the control stick in full circles, then take your hand off and let it center.
 To do this, you need to first right click on the bar for the axis and uncheck "link deadzones." Then, you use the little tabs below the bar to move the 2 boundaries of the deadzone a little bit to the side of either side of the red bar.
 However, it will seem that when you move the stick to the extremes of the axis, you will get more input on one side than the other. So, set up a deadzone the same way on the ends of the bar by pushing the stick all the way to that side, then setting a tab to just over where the red line is.
 Click "apply" and go to "test" on the top. Your axis should now be centered on the test screen, and when you put the stick to the extremes it will go right to the endpoints. Click "ok".
