 Not all flower shops sell pre-made corsages, however, so set aside plenty of time to locate one that does.;
, Prom season also lands around Mother's Day and the start of wedding season, so florists have a greater workload than usual. Ordering well in advance ensures that the florist will be able to complete your request in time.
 Doing so will severely decrease your odds of finding a decent corsage.
