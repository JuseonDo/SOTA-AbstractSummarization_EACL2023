, Shape the ball into an egg shape. Flatten the middle a little to form another smaller egg shaped belly.
 If you'd like, poke a hole at the near bottom of the belly to make a bellybutton.
 Roll them into cylinder shapes. Bend the end to form a paw/hand. Flatten small pieces of yellow clay the same size of the bottom of each paw/hand of the arms and legs. Stick the legs at the bottom and the arms near the top.
 Flatten the front just a bit. This will be the head.
 Stick them on the face. Add another small flattened piece and stick them under the bigger yellow pieces. This will be the muzzle.
 Poke two nostrils in for nostrils.
 You could also stick white pieces, and for the pupils, add small black pieces in them. Stick them on.
 Make yellow or pink smaller semi-circles for the inside of the ear. Stick them to the side of the head. Put the head on top of the body.
 Stick it to the bottom back of the body for a swinging tail.
