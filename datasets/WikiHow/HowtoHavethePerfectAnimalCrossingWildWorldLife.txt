 Also go around each house and plant flowers for a garden. After that make sure you have trees placed right. Say you are by the museum, go on the map and determine your exact location. Make sure there are about two-three boxes between each tree. Try to get as many fruit trees as possible.;
, Boy, girl, tomboy, girly girl, whatever you are make a friend that matches. Bubbly? Nibbles is a great friend for you. Jock? Octavian, sporty animals. Be friends with everyone though. That's the key to popularity: kindness.
 Also buy clothes from the shop next door to Nookington's, called Able Sisters.

Boys: number one shirt, cap is a good mix.
Girls: have a signature clothing piece. A clip you love, hat, anything.
