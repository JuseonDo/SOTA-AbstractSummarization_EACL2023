@summary
figure out the actual temperature.

@summary
use your hand to check the sidewalk and road out of shade.

@summary
do the same for areas under the shade.

@summary
decide if you should still walk your dog.

@summary
if you do decide to take the dog out, stop every few minutes, and if you hit pavement, get to grassy or cool surfaces immediately.

 If it is really hot, like above 95 degrees, you most likely should not have to check. If it is hot, but you are unsure if the pavement will be hot, then you should check.
 Place your hand down on to the sidewalk/road for 10 seconds. If you cannot handle that for 10 seconds, your dog will burn their paws., Sometimes the shade is not the best way to avoid burning their paws. If you cannot handle touching shaded areas of the pavement for 10 seconds, it is too hot., If you really want to walk your dog, wait until it gets cooler, like in the evening or later. Or, you can find a grassy area, as they are usually cooler., Another suggestion is to put your dog on a cool towel on the pavement if you have to bring them outside.
