 This is a common mistake made by early players, as they think the Sheriff can guard them. However, the Murderer may be among the innocents, and will kill both the Sheriff and all of the Innocents. Instead, stay a fair distance away, so that you can grab the dropped gun.;
, These include:


People trying to get behind you
People attempting to join a large group
People staying as close to a Sheriff as possible

, If it is a false accusation, both the Sheriff and the Innocent die. Also, spectators can keep a sharp eye on accused players, in case they try to pull out a knife.
 Use the jumping-running techniques and try to get to a crowd where the sheriff is located to make the sheriff alerted.
