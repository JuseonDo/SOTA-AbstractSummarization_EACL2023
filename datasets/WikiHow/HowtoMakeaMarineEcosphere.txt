@summary
get a jar of your choice, like a mason or pickle jar (depending on how big you want your ecosphere).

@summary
wash your jar for 60 seconds with only warm water as soap will kill the organisms.

@summary
collect sand from either the playground, or a very clean beach.

@summary
add ocean water.

@summary
after you put sand in(about 1" deep), fill you jar with seawater,leaving about 2" of airspace on the top.

@summary
always include small sea shells.

@summary
now add animals.

@summary
after you add the animals into your jar, seal it up and never open it again.

 Make sure it's transparent so that sunlight can pass through.;
, Then dry your jar using a towel.
 Then wash it with water for 70 seconds without draining the sand. And dry it.
 It can be made by mixing dechlorinated water and only ocean salt. Table salt is too poisonous to organisms in your "ocean".
 Then add a small live sea rock which should have both phyto & zooplankton. Now add plants. Either buy live coral or grow algae with the sun.
 Not only it'll stabilize pH levels, but also it stimulates the ocean floor.
 Buy the following organisms listed below:


1 peppermint shrimp
5 small marine hermit crabs
2 turbo snails
20-1000 plankton cells.
 Just put on your windowsill and watch it.
