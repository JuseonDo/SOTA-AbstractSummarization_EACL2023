, Gently twist the tops off from each Oreo cookie and place it on a plate. You can scrape off the frosting from the cookie if desired, but it's best to leave it a for sweeter flavor.
 Using a mini ice cream scoop, scoop a tablespoon of ice cream onto one piece of Oreo and gently press it with another. Continue until there are no more Oreo cookies.
 Carefully roll each sandwich into any of the desired toppings. Ensure you roll only the edges of the sandwich so it can stick to the ice cream.
