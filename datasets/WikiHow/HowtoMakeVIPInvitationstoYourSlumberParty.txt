 Go for glamour, have a black-and-white event, or choose sunglasses, sports cars, or something high tech. Whatever theme you choose, make the invitation consistent with that theme. I mean, wouldn't you hate to get a ball-gown invitation and show up at a science party?;
, In addition to where and when and whom to contact, you could remind your V.I.P. guests what to wear or bring, and exactly what the occasion is.
, You can just fold it in half, or you can learn a bit of origami or envelope-folding. If you'd like your fancy fold to go with your printing or lettering, try it on a piece of plain paper first to find out where to put the letters so they line up with your folding (or fold first, although this could be hard).
 Use stickers, or glue on ribbon or bows, little rhinestones, pop-up cutouts, or anything else cool that you like. Choose decorations that go with your theme.
 Use pinking shears or shaped scrapbook scissors to put a shaped edge on your cards, or add paper or ribbon trim (or both).
 If you don't do too much fancy folding, cut a shaped window in the front cover so that a feature inside peeks through to the front. It could be a simple square or circle or it could be much fancier like a curlicue.
