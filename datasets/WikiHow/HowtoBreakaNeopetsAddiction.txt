 You cannot break it if you don't acknowledge you have it.;
, It can be very hard to concentrate on not doing something. It is much easier to concentrate on doing something. So you must remember all the fun things you used to do before you got sucked in to Neopets.
 Have you been wanting to improve your flexibility? Practice your splits when you wake up. If you love to draw, make a deal with yourself that you will spend thirty minutes a day drawing before you sit down at your computer. If you love to read, arrange a weekly trip to the library and promise yourself you will read for one hour each day before turning on your computer.
 Each day, surprise your parents by sweeping the kitchen floor, or washing the paint on the front door, or throwing in a load of laundry. Not only will this keep you off Neopets for a little bit longer, it will also win you all kinds of 'brownie points' with your family. And it will only take you twenty or thirty minutes, less if you are quick.
 Their interests may inspire you to do more off-line activities yourself.
, This will be your daily time on Neopets. Soon you won't even need the timer anymore.
