 You may be able to get regular rice to taste similar to sushi rice with the help of the right seasoning. However, it is very difficult to get regular rice to have the same sticky consistency as sushi rice. You may be able to use the rice from this method in sashimi, bento, and sushi rolls, but you may find it too difficult to mold for nigiri.,, Try to use the short-grain rice variety, if you can. Short-grain rice tends to have a higher starch content than medium or long-grain rice, which makes it slightly more sticky.


Both jasmine and basmati are considered to be medium-grain.
 The water will likely stop boiling for a few seconds when you add the rice. Wait for the water and rice start to boil again, then reduce the heat and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Continue cooking the rice until all of the water is absorbed.
 Mix everything together with a spoon. This will be the seasoning for your sushi rice. It may also help your rice become a little more sticky., Stir the seasoning with a fork or a small whisk until the sugar is dissolved., Set it aside and let it cool., During the next few steps, you want to avoid using anything made out of metal, or you will risk the vinegar picking up a metallic taste., Do this while the rice is still hot. You don't have to use all of the seasoning if you want a less-intense flavor., You can also use a spatula, but make sure that it is not made out of metal.

Consider working in front of a fan, or having someone wave a paper fan over the bowl. This will help the rice cool down faster.
 Japanese sticky rice is best while it is still warm, but not hot.
