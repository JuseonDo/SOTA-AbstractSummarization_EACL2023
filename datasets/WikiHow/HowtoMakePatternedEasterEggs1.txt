 How many eggs you will boil is up to you, but don't boil more than what you have time to dye in one go.;
, Although the dye will most likely not stain countertops or floors, itâ€™s best to play it safe by covering the area with newspaper and/or finding a workspace that can handle this activity.
 If you're supposed to boil the water, wait until it has cooled safely before dipping the eggs in it.
 Check that the eggs will fit in those squares, with allowance left at the ends so you can tie it all together with a rubber band. If using pantyhose, cut a 5 inch (12.5cm) long tube for the egg to slip into, then knot off each end.
