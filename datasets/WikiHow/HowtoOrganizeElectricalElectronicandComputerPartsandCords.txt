@summary
if you have many parts to organize, label a bin or box for each category.

@summary
label three adjacent sides of each box or bin so they need never be turned, removed or inserted in a consistent manner to see what category of parts it contains.

@summary
put each part or set of identical parts (such as screws or small cables) in a clear closeable plastic bag such as a "zipper" sandwich bag.

@summary
parts with original small containers can stay in them.

 There should be room for growth. Open bins allow for faster access while boxes can more easily be stacked. If you are unsure how big a box is needed sort your parts into piles first. Sample categories are "Internal (computer) cables", "A/V cables", "Network and Phone Cables", "Small power supplies";
, A label maker can make particularly easy to read labels.
 This is very important because plastic bags are compact, do not lock together, and are slippery. They cannot tangle and can be slid about to find what one is looking for or even dumped out onto a flat surface and scooped up and returned to the box later. They are reusable and last a long time stored in a box. Clear bags eliminate the need to label contents.
