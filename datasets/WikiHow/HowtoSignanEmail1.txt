 Other versions of “Best” include “All Best,” “My Best to You,” simply “Best” and “Best Regards.”Remember that the more words you use, the more formal your sign off will be. Judge the formality based on the person to whom you are writing and their relationship to you.;
, Expressing sincere thanks is best done in the body of an email. If you must do this, try using “Many Thanks,” which carries a note of finality.
 This is a very traditional form of signing a letter; however, it should really only be used in the “To Whom it May Concern” addressed. Use it when you don’t know the person who is reading it.


“Sincerely” or “Thank You For Your Consideration” may be appropriate for job applications.
Try “Continued Success” if you are looking to leave a partnership or correspondence for a while.
, Then, start a new line.
 Use your first and last name when you are writing for the first time.
 Try to keep it short. Include your title, company and contact info.


It’s a good idea to preload this onto your email program to save you time.
Most companies have a standard signature that they like you to use.
 They will make your email harder to load.
