 Use a pencil to draw a square or rectangle that fits around the hole.
 Making a straight-sided shape will allow you to easily replace that piece of drywall.
 This will be used to form a backing for the new drywall. The larger the hole, the more backing you should provide. Make sure to cut it about 4 inches (10 cm) longer (or wider) than the area you want to patch.
 Center it so it extends behind your existing drywall by about 2 inches (5 cm) at each edge.
 Use 1-1/4-inch (3.2 cm) drywall screws. You can use a screwdriver, a screw gun or a drill. Countersink the screws (driving them below the wall surface) to make them invisible once theyâ€™re covered with mud.
 Be sure the new piece is no thicker than your existing drywall. Affix it by screwing it to the backer piece.
, Let the patched area dry before continuing.
 To cut down on the dust that sanding causes, you can simply wipe the dried mud with a damp (not soaked) cloth. This will usually work as well as sanding. (However, note the warning below regarding damp-wiping.)

, Lightly sand or damp-wipe after each coat.
