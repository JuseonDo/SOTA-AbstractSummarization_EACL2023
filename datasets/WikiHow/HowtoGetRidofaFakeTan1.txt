 This prevents baby oil from permanently staining clothing you care about.;
, Baby oil helps loosen the top layer of dead skin cells that have been tanned.
 This allows the baby oil to penetrate deeply into your pores.
 This is the amount of time needed for the baby oil to loosen dead skin cells.


Avoid coming into contact with furniture or clothing during this time, since baby oil can permanently damage most fabrics.
 Warm bathwater softens your skin even more so you can effectively slough away dead skin cells.
 The tan will be removed from your skin relatively easily after having been treated with baby oil.
