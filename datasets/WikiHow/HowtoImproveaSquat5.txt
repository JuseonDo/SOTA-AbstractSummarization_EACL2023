@summary
use this method to do anaerobic squats (non-aerobic), with the feet at about shoulder width, chin up.

 Lean forward as needed for balance; start without weights.

This may avoid pain by not doing full motion squats (limiting repetitious motion).


Begin to squat by lowering your bottom about 3 inches and hold.
Take another 3 inches downward and hold. Continue until your thighs are slightly above parallel to the floor. Return to standing position.


If you need more resistance, use dumbbells held out front, with forearms parallel to the floor, or lifted a little.
