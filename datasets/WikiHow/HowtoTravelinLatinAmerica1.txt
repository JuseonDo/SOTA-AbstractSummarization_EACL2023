 All Latin American countries require passports for entry (Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil also require tourists visas; these can be purchased at the border).



Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America have a relatively stable climate throughout the year. In southern South America, winter occurs from approximately May to September and summer is from December to March.



If you will be in rural areas with a large concentration of mosquitoes, such as the rain forests of Central America, get a malaria vaccination.



In general, traveling in Latin America entails moving from north to south or vice versa, given the geography of the region. Common itineraries include moving from northern Mexico south to Panama, going from Venezuela or Colombia north to the Caribbean countries of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and going south from Colombia to Argentina or Chile.



This will help you travel across different regions and give you a basic itinerary. Some of the most popular destinations in Latin America include Buenos Aires in Argentina, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, the rainforests of Colombia, and the beaches of Costa Rica.
