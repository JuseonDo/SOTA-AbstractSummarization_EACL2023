 Roses are very deliberate, and giving the wrong color may send the wrong message. Because these symbols are widely known, be sure that the color you choose matches to the correct feeling you want the receiver to know.


Red means love, pink is a great choice for admiration, yellow is for friendship, white stands for purity and can be used for weddings and funerals, orange is known for conveying passion, and purple is for enchantment or "love at first sight.";
, The petals on each rose should be vibrant in color and free from wilting or brown edges, both of which indicate that the roses are older and may have a shorter lifespan.
 Known as a "bullet," rose heads that are still very closed at purchase stand a good chance of staying that way. Instead of blooming, they may simply lose their outer petals and die.
 If a rose is fully blossomed, it has already reached the peak of its life and will not last as long as others might. The ideal time to purchase roses should be when the flowers are slightly opened. The petals should be a bit loose at the top of the rose head, which allows you to see that it has a decent chance of flowering.
 Knowing when the flowers arrived can help you determine how old they are and how long they have to live.
 Keep them in a cool, dark storage container if at all possible until they arrive.
, The only things that should be inside the vase are the rose stems and water.
 For optimal rose life, change the water every other day.
 Roses will wilt and die very quickly if they are subject to any heat.
