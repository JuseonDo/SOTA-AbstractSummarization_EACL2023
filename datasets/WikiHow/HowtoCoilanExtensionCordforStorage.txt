@summary
unravel the extension cord.

@summary
take both the female end and male end and hold them together.

@summary
hold the ends of the cord with one hand.

@summary
hold the cord with your left hand so that a loop is formed with the halfway point centered at the top of the loop.

@summary
,

@summary
grab the remaining cord that is below the loop with your right hand.

@summary
let go of the cord with the left hand so that a new loop is formed.

@summary
hold the loop at the base.

@summary
put your left hand through the loop with your palm facing up.

@summary
,grab the remaining cord with your palm still facing up.

@summary
pull the remaining cord through the loop so that you form another loop.

@summary
move your right hand to the next base of the next loop, while still holding the loop you just brought through.

@summary
pull more of the cord through.

@summary
move your right hand to next loop base to hold that in place, while still holding the loop you just brought through.

@summary
continue to pull the cord through each loop.

@summary
finish with the last loop.

@summary
store your cord.

 This will get any of the tangles and kinks out of the cord.

The object of this step is to ensure that the extension cord is not full of twists, kinks and entanglements.;
, Do not connect them, though.
 Then use your other hand to run down the cord to the halfway point to get anymore kinks out of the cord before you begin to wrap the cord.,, Pull through the loop partially creating another loop., You should be holding the loop with your right hand.
 The base is the part of the loop where the halfway point meets the other part of the cord.,,, Youâ€™ll see the start of a chain beginning which is what makes this method so special.
, Remember to have your palm up every time you grab the cord. This will make another loop, thus creating another link in the chain.,, Try to keep your loops consistent sizes so that you create a better chain for storage.

Notice how each chain is a similar size. Try to keep that size as you make each link in the chain. Depending on how long of an extension cord will determine the size of the loop, since you don't want to be looping small links for relatively long cords.
 As you get closer to the two ends, your last loop will be different.

Grab the cord like you have for the previous steps.
Pull the cord through to make a small loop (depending what you are left with in length).
Separate the female end and male ends.
Put one end through the loop.






Connect the ends.
 Now the cord is secure, it is up to the user where to store it. You can hang it up, or bundle it.
