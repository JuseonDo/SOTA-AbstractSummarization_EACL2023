if your team is complaining about your mic, just turn it off, don't continue talking or make fun of them because you're angry.

 They will get really mad at you when you keep on yelling at them, possibly eventually leaving the game. This is bad, especially if they were a good player. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.;
, This will get them really annoyed, especially since you're not focusing on killing the other team or capturing the point. If friendly fire is on, there's a chance you'll get banned from the server as well.
, If you're new, I suggest searching up some tips and practicing with friends or in a private match by yourself to get the hang of it. You should find the class that you're most comfortable with as well.
 Don't stay in your base all day, or rush too far ahead of your teammates, as you will die.
