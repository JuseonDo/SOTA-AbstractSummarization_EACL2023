, As soon as they gather 800 foods, advance to the second age.
 Build 10 houses, an artillery foundry, and a barrack. Your settler count now would be around 20, as you get a free settler for every house built.
 Food is required faster than coin to build an army, wood is not that important, as both grenadier and musketeer do not require them.
, These guys are very good at bringing the buildings down to ground. And gather as many musketeers as possible because Napoleon is very good at building an army.
 If he reaches the third age, then he will be getting more upgrades for his army and you can expect cannons also.
 Press Ctrl+1, and in the same way select your entire musketeer and press Ctrl+2. From here on, you can press 1 to select grenadiers and 2 for musketeers.
 If you want to attack his enemy soldiers, you can press 2 (donâ€™t go for attacking soldiers with grenadiers because they are slow and vulnerable). Attack enemy buildings with grenadier by pressing 1.
