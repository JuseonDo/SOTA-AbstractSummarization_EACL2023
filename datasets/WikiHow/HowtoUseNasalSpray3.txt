 Remove as much mucus as possible. Do not blow too hard. For best and safest results, press down on one nostril with your finger as you blow the other, and then do the same to the other nostril., Prime the pump spray before using it.You do this by squirting it into the air until it becomes a mist. It is important to "prime" it first with this type of nasal spray to ensure that the actual medication is what gets into your nostril and then absorbed.
 You should grasp the bottle with your middle and index fingers on top and your thumb securing the bottle.
 Close your mouth, and squeeze the pump down just as you slowly breathe in through the one nostril receiving the medicine. Make sure that you take in the medicine. Do the same with the other nostril, making sure that you press down the nostril that just received the medicine. Do not take more than the specified amount of sprays.
