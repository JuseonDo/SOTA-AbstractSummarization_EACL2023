, Some signals include the paper and/or paints themselves (if they have been prepositioned beforehand).
, Make sure the top two tabs are in approximately the same place, as to take up the area covered by the paints and a portion of the paper.


Don't worry, if the area underneath the table doesn't have an area that is suitable to the product sticking to it (for the bottom two tabs). If the product hangs down, just be careful. It's sometimes useful if the product hangs (as to give you more surface area to work with for spills, as if the paint drips, it first has to run more onto the mat before it runs onto the clothing underneath).






Think about positioning the mat in landscape position, so that the tabbed areas are to the left and right of the drawing area, if the child has a small perspective of their working area (school-age children may enjoy this convenience).
