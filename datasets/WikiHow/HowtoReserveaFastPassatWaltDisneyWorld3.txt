,, To run the FastPasses on an app, only the original app holder can modify and add selections. If you ticket hasn't been included in the group, you'll need to have the head of the group merge your ticket into the group.
 The tiered rule still exists, but the return time will depend on the exact time of day you are running this reservation and the amount of FastPass reservations still left for the tier.


You can also cancel and modify your FastPasses as well as have maps and other useful features on your phone.
 Scan your ticket or wrist-band at the RFID terminal to be able to proceed into the attraction at the designated time (or within a set period of time shortly thereafter). Your FastPasses will automatically be on your ticket(s) or band(s). Just scan them at the FastPass line.
