 Cut in about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm). The flesh will peel open and reveal a black or white "vein" just beneath the surface. This is actually the digestive tract of the shrimp - stomach and colon in all.
 Start lifting it with your fingers.
 Try to pull it out in one piece, so you don't end up with a lot of vein pieces. Use the knife to pry away any flesh that might be getting in the way. Discard the vein once you've pulled it out.
 Some shrimp have a second vein on the belly side. If yours does, use the knife to make a second slit along the belly. Lift out the vein using the knife and your fingers.
 The vein can be sticky, so make sure no bits get left behind.
 Shrimp deteriorate quickly in warm air, and they need to be kept cold. Put yours in the refrigerator or a bowl of ice water.
