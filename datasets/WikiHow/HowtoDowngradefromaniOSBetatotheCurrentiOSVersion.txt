 For Mac users, go to the same link and run the .dmg file to install iTunes;
,Â Make sure iCloud backup is on and then make a backup to iCloud.
 Click the device icon in the top left corner to bring up the management settings for your device. Choose the option to create a local backup to your computer just in case something goes wrong and select "Backup now".
 Then boot your device into recovery mode by pressing and holding down the home button exactly at the same time as you connect it to your computer with the Lightning USB cable. The iTunes logo with a picture of a cable below it should appear.
 If your device booted into recovery mode successfully, you should now get a pop-up in iTunes saying that it has detected an iDevice in recovery mode and that it must be restored before it can be used with iTunes. Just press OK to close it.
 You now have two options, "Update" and "Restore". Both will bring your device back to the latest official iOS version, but Restore will wipe your device clean of all its data, a factory reset. Therefore, click "Update" to keep your data. Even though you are technically downgrading instead, this will still work.
 You can monitor the progress by clicking the Download icon in the upper right-hand corner. Once it is downloaded, the installation will start. Keep your device plugged into your computer the entire time to avoid permanently bricking it.
 Once the installation is finished, reactivate your iDevice in iTunes with your Apple ID and then unplug from your computer. That's it!
