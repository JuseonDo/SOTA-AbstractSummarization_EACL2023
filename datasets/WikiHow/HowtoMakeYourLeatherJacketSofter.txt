 Leather is skin from an animal, and has many of the same properties as human skin. When you have dry skin, you add lotion to it and it softens your skin; the same is true on a leather jacket.;
, The conditioners are easily available in the market. While making the leather jacket pliable and soft they also help to protect and moisturize it!

, The more moisturized the jacket, the better the outcome!

, Crush the leather all the way from the shoulders to the cuffs. This ensures that the conditioner is well settled into even the tiniest nooks and crevices of the jacket thus yielding the best results.
, Don’t choose blow dryers that do not let you adjust the heat as it may lead to negative results due to over or under heating. We only need to warm the jacket as this will help to both soak up and seal in the conditioner into the jacket. While blow drying the jacket, make sure that you keep the blow dryer at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the jacket and keep moving the dryer around without focusing on one spot for too long!

, This will help give it a nice shine.
