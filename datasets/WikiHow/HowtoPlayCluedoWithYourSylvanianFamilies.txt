, They can be anywhere you wish, but make sure it looks okay with the rest of the room, a bucket and spade in the bathroom might look a bit weird!, If there are a lot of you, you might want to form teams., Whichever number it was, that Sylvanian is your murderer. Place them wherever you like., That Sylvanian is the murdered person. Place them anywhere, but make sure they look dead!, Try to have it so that there is one in each room. Be careful where you place your Sylvanian figures. Making the murderer stand out won't work very well- you'll see quite soon.,, That player's Sylvanian must stand on the number stair that was rolled on the dice. (e.g. if you roll a 4, the Sylvanian must stand on the fourth stair) If you have no stairs, stand your figures outside the house., Each number is a room. So, if a 5 was rolled, they would go through five rooms and stop in the fifth room. If you land in the room the murder is in on your second go (per 2 goes and then the murderer's turn round), you are dead, unless somebody else is in the room with them., This means you can roll the dice and move a Sylvanian to another place, using the rules you could normally do., You move as normal, but if the murderer is alone with jut one person when they enter a new room, they can murder somebody. Roll the dice to justify whether or not they should be murdered. If the dice displays a number of three or under, the Sylvanian will be a murder victim. If the number is over three, nobody is murdered that time around., The only way you can get out of it is if there is already somebody that is not dead) in that room., When all your own characters are murdered, they can come back into the game., You roll your dice as usual, and when you enter the room in which the murderer is in, you roll the dice again. If the number is under three, the murderer has killed you, and if over three, you have won!
