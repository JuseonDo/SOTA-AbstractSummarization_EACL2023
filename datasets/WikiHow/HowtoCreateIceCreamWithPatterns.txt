, This will be the flavor that you start off with. It will also have a larger quantity than the other flavors.
 Leave it out on the table and watch over it, ensuring no bugs come to eat it and stirring the ice cream with a spoon/chopstick every now and then. This process of melting can take as little as 5 minutes to as long as 20, depending on your climate.
 This will shape up your ice cream nicely.
, The liquid should take up its original solid shape as edible ice cream.
).
 Delicately carve the desired pattern/shape into your base flavored ice cream. If the ice cream is too hard to be carved into, wait 1 or so minutes.
 After that, take your second flavor (different from the first) and melt it (similar to step 3).
 Pour the melted ice cream (second flavor) into the measuring cup.
 Set it beside the measuring cup. Pour the contents of the cup into the carved spaces of the base ice cream.
 Let the liquid freeze.
