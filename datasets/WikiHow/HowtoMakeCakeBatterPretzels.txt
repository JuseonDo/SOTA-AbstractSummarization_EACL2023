 This is the fun part. You can make as many shapes as you want, and you can make any shape. Be sure to keep them all separate.
 Be sure the cookie sheet is sprayed with cooking spray.
 If you got store bought frosting then just go watch TV or do something.
 Wait until the shapes cool.
 Dip each shape carefully in the frosting. Use a knife to make sure it is spread out neatly.
