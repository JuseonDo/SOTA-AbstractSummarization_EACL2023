Keep your cell phone fully charged. You may not have reception in the area where you break down, but if you choose to leave your vehicle and travel closer to civilization, you may be able to pick up reception.
Bring hard copies of your maps. Just because your cell phone is working now does not mean that your cell phone will work if you get stuck in the wilderness of a desert. MapQuest maps are great for to and from directions, but you might consider an atlas to have a better picture of the area 360 degrees around your breakdown site.
Pack plenty of food and water. Bottled water and nonperishable food items make great snack items, but they can also generally keep until the next trip.
Make sure that you have your spare tire with your vehicle in case of a flat. With that, ensure that all of your tire-changing tools are packed in the vehicle as well.
Keep blankets in the back of your vehicle. They don't take up much room, and you will be grateful to have them when the temperature drops.
Keep a small emergency kit with matches and/or a lighter, flares, a flashlight, first aid supplies and other miscellaneous items in your vehicle.
Additional items to consider keeping in your vehicle are tire repair goo and a small tire pump. You may not be strong enough to change your tire, but you can probably patch and refill the air every couple of miles to get you to a safe location.
You might also think about packing a signal mirror, a weapon and comfortable hiking shoes, just in case.;
,, This will help you in the event that a decision has to be made regarding leaving the vehicle to seek help or staying with it to flag someone down to assist.
 Get trained in how to change a tire, how to cool an engine, etc.
, Your best survival is to stick with the vehicle, try to repair it and/or flag down another driver.
,,, Let them know your departure time and estimated time of arrival so that they can seek emergency help if you are gone considerably longer than expected.
