 You may find that some other people speak the language perfectly, but nothing ever comes easy. Practice whenever you can! On your way to work, at school, when you're on wikiHow...;
, For example, if you want to say 'hello', the word is வணக்கம், or vanakkam. To get the pronunciation correctly, try saying the word like this: vann-ak-kum

,,, For example, the sound of 'ழ' is not found in any language.
 For example,letters ர்-ற் has the sound 'ir' but the ‘ர்’ is pronounced soft while the letter 'ற்’ is pronounced hard.
 But you can also learn from Tamil learning CDs and DVDs too.
 It would be difficult to master the language, but that doesn't mean you should give up! Progress slowly. Practice for a certain amount of time each day (i.e., 15 minutes), increasing the amount of time each day.
