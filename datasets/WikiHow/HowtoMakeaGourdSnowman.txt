@article
 It should be bottle shaped and have a smaller bulb at what will be the top part (the snowman's head). The base (or body) part of the gourd should be larger. If possible, check that the gourd is balanced and stands on its own before purchasing it (although if it doesn't, don't worry too much â€“ see the solution in the last step).;
, Remove the stem first, then scrub off any dirt residue. Use a sponge or pot scrubber to help remove any marks or dirt.
 Use wood putty to fill the hole and sand over using fine sandpaper.



As you paint the hat, turn it around and paint each side.
,, The face should consist of:


Black charcoal eyes
An orange carrot nose
Charcoal dots for a mouth.
 The neck area is the join between the upper and lower levels of the gourd.



Place small dots of black paint down the front of the body part of the gourd. These are the snowman's buttons.
Paint on mittens.



Insert small twigs to form arms.
, If it doesn't stand on its own, place it on top of a grapevine wreath.
