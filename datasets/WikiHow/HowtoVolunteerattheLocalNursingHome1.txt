 If you are a minor, you will need this permission to start volunteering.;
,, Locate a calendar so that you will know when you are free to volunteer, and have a pen and paper to write down important information.
 When someone answers, say "hello, my name is _____ and I would like to volunteer at (__name of nursing home__). Can you tell me who to talk to?".


They will either give you a name and phone number, which you should write on your paper, then you should thank them and hang up. Or they will offer to connect you to the volunteer supervisor.You should thank them and wait to be connected.
 Then just say "hello, my name is _____ and I would like to volunteer at (__name of nursing home__)." They will be happy for your help and will guide you through what to do next.
