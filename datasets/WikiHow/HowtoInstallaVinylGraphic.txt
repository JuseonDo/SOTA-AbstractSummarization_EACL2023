 The surface should be non porous for the most favorable results. A primed or flat finish will also be a problem if quality is intended. The surface should be clean and dust free. Using a low grade detergent. Be sure the detergent will not have ammonia in it, window cleaner has a poor application and drying time.;
, Take into consideration any contours, bends and moldings.
 Make sure you keep the markings away from the area of application and use the marks a guide only.
, This is done by finding the area to be applied and hold it firmly in place, take a piece of masking tape and tape across the top of the graphic so when you lift it up it will lay back down to the original position.
