 The liver flush itself can cause nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting. If you're not used to fasting, these effects may be amplified.


If you are an experienced faster, consider doing a three to seven day juice fast before the liver flush.
Apple juice is rich in malic acid and liminoid, which can help break down gallstones.;
, This mixture will be 50% grapefruit juice, 25% orange juice, and 25% lemon juice. Squeeze the grapefruits, oranges, and lemons separately and do not mix the juices at first. You will need 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice, 1/4 cup of orange juice, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Mix them together well, then split the mixture up into separate glasses, each filled with 1/4 cup of juice.


You will also need 1 cup of olive oil separated into four doses of Â¼ cup each.
 Take 1/4 cup of the citrus mixture, followed by 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Repeat this process every 15 minutes, until it's time to go to bed.
 Although there's no evidence for it, the traditional belief is that this allows the cleanse to progress more easily.
 To get to most out of your cleanse, make an appointment to have an enema the morning after you drink these fluids. Enemas should always be performed by trained professionals. Do not attempt to give yourself an enema.
