 Slinkies are made that way!

, Let it sit and enjoy nature or romp around in the leaves.
 Children's shows are great for a Slinky to enjoy, such as Blue's Clues, Little Einsteins, SpongeBob SquarePants, and the Wonder Pets. Movies are great fun, too!

, You can even consider buying it a friend (another Slinky) to keep it company.
 Bring it on plane trips too.
