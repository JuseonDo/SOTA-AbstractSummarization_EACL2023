 Put this color mix on with a brush and use pigment fixer to set the color.
 Apply this too with a brush and use the fixer to set it as well. It's important to re-wet the entire section so that no tide marks will be left from the fixer as it dries. Some examples of good colors to use are in the picture shown with this step.
, Re-wet the entire area with the fixer. The results are shown in the picture accompanying this step.
 Use the same approach with layering of the pigments and the same colors to make it match. Use the same layering approach on the front and rear of the vehicle as well.
 On top of the front fenders, sprinkle a dry mix of pigments in the same color blend, dip a large brush in pigment fixer, and touch the edge of the fenders, and the capillary effect will do the rest of the job. Make sure you don't touch the pigments with a wet brush. Let the fixer flow freely and allow it to surround the sprinkled on pigments. This is to avoid the flattened look and get some structure in the mud.


The same flicking/sprinkling method is used on the rear of the vehicle.
