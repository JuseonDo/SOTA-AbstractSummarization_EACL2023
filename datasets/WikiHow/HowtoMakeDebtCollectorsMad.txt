@summary
know your rights: every state and the federal government have laws designed to prevent debt collectors from harassing consumers.

@summary
validate the debt: every collector, especially those that are trying to scam you, wants you to just pay on a debt.

@summary
verify the debt: verification is a lot like validation.

@summary
consult a lawyer: like with validation/verification, debt collectors hate it when a lawyer or a law firm gets involved.

@summary
sue the collector: if the debt collector violates the fdcpa (fair debt collection practices act) you can sue them.

@summary
pay the debt: you’re probably asking “how is paying on the debt going to make a debt collector mad?
@article
 The more you know what the collection agencies can’t do, the better you protect yourself.;
, They hate having to do anything that doesn’t involve them getting your money. And a collector, who’s trying to scam you into paying a debt you don’t owe, hates it when you don’t just give them your money.
 Here, you make sure the creditor/collection agency has the legal right to collect the debt rather than asking the creditor/collection agency if you actually owe the debt.
 Since the debt collectors want to get as much money from you as they can, and since the average person isn’t trained in negotiation like a lawyer, they figure they can get more money from you if you aren’t represented.
 If the court finds them guilty of violating the FDCPA, the collector will be fined $1000 per violation and may have to pay your attorney fees and court costs.
 Wouldn’t that make them happy?” Sometimes yes. However if you’re sure you owe the debt, and you pay on the debt, nothing will make a collector madder. They want to be able to continue being able to add interest, late fees, and penalties to your account. If you pay off the account, they lose the chance to make more of a profit. So do everything you can to pay off the debt as soon as you can.
