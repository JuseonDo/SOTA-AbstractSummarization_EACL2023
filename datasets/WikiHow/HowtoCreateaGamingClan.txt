examples: clan recruiter(s), site editor, moderator, and admin.
 Make it original.
 You can also name how your ranks to keep them unique.
 Keep them simple and easy to follow.
 The best way for this is usually making a website for others to be able to see. This way they can check news updates,tournaments,see what members have joined,post calendars,and receive updates other than on the game. So, making a website would probably be your best bet if you're trying to figure out the best way of group contact.
 More people usually means more fun.



Take one of your best or moderately good players and let the recruit battle them. This way you can rate on how good the recruit is and how good he/she reacted to winning or losing.
 This way they'll have a sense of really being a part of the group.
 You don't want your members to start arguing or fighting.
 This way you'll have another group who can help your group when it's not doing so fine.
 This way others will respect you and will be willing to compete against you often)

, Make sure that everyone uses this rule, it's important.
