 If using fresh chili peppers in the salsa, knowing how to peel them is an important part of the preparation process. There are two basic methods, one for those who have access to a gas flame and one for those who only have an electrical heat source. In both cases, be aware that the fumes from heated chilies can irritate your lungs, so do not inhale.;
,
Turn on a gas burner flame and roast them over the flame.
When the skins to blister and darken, remove them. Don't allow them to burn.
 When the skins become scorched and blackened, remove the chilies.
 Tie the bag up to trap the steam. Put the bag aside for 20 minutes.



The capsaicin in chili peppers can irritate your skin and eyes badly. Do not absent-mindedly wipe your eyes or pick your nose with your chili pepper covered fingers!
Wash your hands with soap and water after finishing handling the chili peppers, or wear gloves.
