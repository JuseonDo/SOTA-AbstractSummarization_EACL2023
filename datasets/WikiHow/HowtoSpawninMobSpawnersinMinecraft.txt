 Instead of writing {name}, write your Minecraft username: /give {name} minecraft:mob_spawner.


This would be written as (for example): /give InfN555 minecraft:mob_spawner (where "InfN555" is just a username, so use yours instead!).;
, If you are making an exp/item grinder, it would be best to have it placed in a room where there are 4 blocks of air on each side before the wall, since this is the mob spawner spawning limit.
 To do this, no commands are needed; just go into your creative inventory (of course, if you are in survival mode, then you will need a command), and go to the search bar, and search "egg". A list of eggs will appear, just make sure not to take the normal egg (the one which a chicken drops every now and again).
 It should turn the mob inside into the spawn egg's mob.
