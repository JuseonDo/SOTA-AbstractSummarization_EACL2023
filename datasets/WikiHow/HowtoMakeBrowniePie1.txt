 When it's done cooking, let it cool and scoop out the middle, leaving about a 1/2-inch thick brownie shell behind. Don't scoop too thin, but if you do, patch it up with some of the brownies you already scooped up. Place the innards of the brownies in a bowl for later.
 You can choose either regular or instant for this., Put this new mix into the centre of the brownie shell. Spread it out evenly., Sprinkle the remaining scooped out brownies on top., Enjoy!
