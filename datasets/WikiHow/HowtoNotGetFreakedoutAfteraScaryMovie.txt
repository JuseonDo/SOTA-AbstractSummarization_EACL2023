sometimes, although it sounds strange, you will be drawn to watch the movie again because it was scary.

@summary
if you think you can cope, watch the movie over and over and over and over.

@summary
discuss the film with friends and family.

@summary
hopefully, and remember it will take time, you will overcome your fear.

@summary
watch a family movie after the scary movie, if you have time.

 Avoid storing it near your bedroom, as come night, you will not stop thinking about it, keep glancing at it, and will feel as if the fear from the movie is returning. If things get really bad, sell or destroy the DVD entirely.;
,, This may be good sign, as it probably means you were entertained/scared rather than just scared.
 You will get severely bored, but the scary parts will become dull from constantly seeing them. Do not stop watching until the movie becomes unbearably boring.
 The chances are your parents will have watched it too and will offer support and comfort.
 Unless the movie was absolutely terrifying, the chances are your memories will fade away, and in a few years you will have forgotten what it was about altogether.
 This will make the night (if watching at night) seem more fun. If watching by day, a funny comedy or romance just takes your mind off the scary movie.
