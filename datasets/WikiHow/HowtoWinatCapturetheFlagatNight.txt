 Dark blues, grays, browns and greens tend to be less visible at night than actual black because of the silhouettes. Camouflage should match the local environment. The outfit must be comfortable and versatile. Waterproof, washable, durable clothing is desirable. Also, clothing should not be loud-this means no loose clothing that rubs together, things that jingle, or stiff clothing/shoes that creak. Sweats are best.
, Once there, wait for 20-30 seconds, checking for defenders. Lunge across the border in a low stance. Dive or step into the nearest brush (depending on the amount of time you think you have).,

If you do not have a radio, simply wait for someone to do something stupid.
, The people around you can block tags from the other team, giving you some cover.

If no one else is available, sneak out the way you came in. This almost always works.
 Be sure to rub it in. Now you have bragging rights!
