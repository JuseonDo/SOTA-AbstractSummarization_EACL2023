, Microwave until melted, stirring after every 45 seconds to prevent overheating. Once the chocolate mixture is melted and completely smooth, pour half of it in the prepared pan and smooth it into an even layer. Set aside the remaining chocolate mixture for later use, and place the pan in the refrigerator to set the chocolate while you prepare the next layer.
 Stir until the butter is melted and the sugar dissolves. Stir occasionally until the mixture comes to a boil. Once it reaches this point, stir continuously while boiling for five minutes.
 Spread this over the chocolate layer in the pan, taking care to not disturb the chocolate and to spread it in an even layer. Return the pan to the refrigerator to set the peanut layer.
 Microwave until melted, stirring after every minute to prevent overheating. If the caramels are very stiff and resist melting, add another tablespoon of water, but only if completely necessary. (Adding too much liquid will make the caramel soft and cause it to ooze from the fudge once it is cut.)

, Smooth it into an even layer, and return the pan to the refrigerator to briefly set the caramel, for about 10 minutes.
 Pour the chocolate over the caramel and spread it into a smooth, even layer. Allow the fudge to set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
 Cut the fudge into small 1-inch squares.
