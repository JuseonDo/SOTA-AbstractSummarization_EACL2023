it may seem crazy, but brushing your lips can result in smooth, plump, chap free lips.

@summary
put lotion, moisturizer, or even oil(baby oil works best) on the toothbrush.

@summary
now, just start scrubbing.

then, rinse the brush off, and apply chapstick on your lips to seal that moisture.

 First, get an old toothbrush, or new one, but not one that you use on your teeth. Rinse it thoroughly, just in case.
 Make sure that the brush is clean before you do so.
 Be gentle, because your lips are delicate. Caution; if your lips are cracked/bleeding, then do not do this method, it will bleed even more. What you are doing is exfoliating your lips with the little bristles in the toothbrush, essentially making them smooth and soft. This is revealing a new layer of smooth lips underneath the old cracked layer.
 Try to incorporate this into your beauty routine, but remember, this is basically exfoliating, so do not do it every day. Only when your lips are hopelessly chapped.
