Older Jeeps are the best.
New Wranglers are good but they cost a lot!
The best off road vehicles are small with lots of ground clearance.;
, They are just too big to fit on trails.
 Extra oil, spare tire, jack, water, and things for you in case of that small chance you get stuck and have to hike back.
 Old Mountain Back roads that aren't used often are usually good for beginners.
,, Some may be too big to straddle. If you try to drive straight over a rock that is too big you can damage the bottom of your vehicle or crack the engine's oil pan and then you and your vehicle are stuck.
, This will help you get through difficult spots without the help of a spotter to tell you where to drive.


Practice using a setup of aluminum soda cans in a parking lot. Try to crush each can with the passenger side tires. Successfully doing this in reverse a few times is very helpful when you find yourself at the dead end of the wrong trail.
