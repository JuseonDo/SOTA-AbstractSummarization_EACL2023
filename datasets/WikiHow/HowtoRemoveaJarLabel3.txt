 If the label is too difficult to peel off, soak the jar in warm, soapy water for 10 minutes, then peel the label off. You will have some residue, but that is fine.Avoid using nail polish remover or acetone if your jar is made from plastic. They may distort or discolor the jar. Rubbing alcohol may be safely substituted but it may not be very effective.
 If there is a lot of residue, stick with a scrubby sponge. Acetone will also work for this method. Rubbing alcohol may work, but it will not be as effective as nail polish remover or acetone; it is best reserved for light residue.
 The chemicals in the nail polish remover or acetone will dissolve any glue and make it easier to scrub off. You may have to reapply the nail polish remover or acetone.
 This is especially necessary if you plan on using your jar for food storage. Once the jar is clean, pat it dry with a clean towel and use it for your project.
