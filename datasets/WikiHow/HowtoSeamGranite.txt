 If the seams don’t line up properly or are rough, remedy the problem. Don’t grout your granite until you’re happy with the edges and fit.

, Some epoxies claim that they don’t stick to polished granite, meaning you shouldn’t need tape. Check the directions on the epoxy you’re using, but if you’re not sure, go with the tape when you seam granite.
 Mix the tint into the epoxy resin before adding the hardener. To ensure the best results, check the color by letting a small amount of epoxy dry. You can adjust the color accordingly based on the test.









You can get color kits at any home improvement store. When in doubt, go with more subdued colors; you don’t want the seam to be brighter or more colorful than the granite. Try mixing a few different shades and seeing which one look the least obtrusive next to your granite.
 You will use this to pull the two pieces of granite together as the seam dries. Leave room so you can work underneath the turnbuckle attachments.
,, Don’t over tighten or you’ll pull the suction cups off the granite. Depending on your situation, you may also be able to use wedges to push the pieces of granite together.
