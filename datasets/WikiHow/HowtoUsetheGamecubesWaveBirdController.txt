 Now that Nintendo is focusing its efforts on newer consoles, the WaveBird controller is no longer in production. Your best bet to buy one is to find an online retailer, such as Amazon or eBay.
 To do this, take the battery cover off of the back of the controller and insert the batteries in the slots. Once you've done so, put the battery cover back on the controller., On the bottom of the controller, you'll find a switch that you can move left and right to set the controller to one of the channels., The switch is located on the bottom of the receiver.,, If the previous steps were done correctly, you'll see a light flash on both the controller and receiver.
