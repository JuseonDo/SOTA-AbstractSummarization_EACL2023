  Divide the page into equal quarters. Along the top edge, make a mark at 4 1/2 inches and draw a light pencil line from top to bottom.  Measure down 5 1/2" and draw a light pencil line from side to side. These lines are to keep your strips straight and on track.;
,  Be sure to cut an equal number of strips of any of the colors you have chosen.  Begin work by placing a colored strip along the left edge of the paper.  Add a second and third contrasting colored strip next to it.  Use a glue stick to secure these strips to the base.  You will be working vertically.
  Continue gluing colored strips, first on the left side and repeating on the right side until they meet in the middle.  Your entire base will be covered with colored strips in a precise mirror image pattern., Place short strips horizontally.  Keep the center line in mind as you work the left side of your design first.   Layer thinner strips over the existing strips.  Add triangles and circles.  Cut some metallic tag board strips and geometric shapes and add them.  Remember to stop at the center line.  Replicate what you have done, working in from the left side to the center., Cut out this rectangle by poking into the center with scissors and carefully cutting it out, or use a utility knife and ruler.,
