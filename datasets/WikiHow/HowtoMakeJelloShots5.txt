 Lime and orange flavors are ideal, as they will taste similar to vodka-based mixed drinks. Cherry may leave your Jello with a flavor reminiscent of cough syrup. Berry blue and grape are not recommended either.
 Don't skimp on this stepâ€”the water needs to be actually boiling to effectively dissolve the powder, and the mixture won't set if you use less than 4 oz.
, You can actually add up to 2-1/4 cups of 80-proof vodka and the Jello will still set. However, anything more than 1-3/4 cups will cause the gelatin to get soft and slimy, and the liquor will overwhelm all of the other flavors.
 If you used 1-3/4 cups of vodka, you will be able to make eighteen 1-oz. (30 ml) shots, or nine 2-oz. (60 ml) shots.
