 Your child will be popular in this costume, because there will be muffins to carry and give away.
 You will cover up the majority of it with the costume.
 A white apron will create a more noticeable contrast than 1 with a saying or design on it.
 These are available online or in kitchen stores. It is also sometimes known as a "Toque."
