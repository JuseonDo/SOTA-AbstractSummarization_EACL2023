 This will set the pace and the incline for your interval-based workout. If your fitness level only allows you to walk on a flat surface, then you should opt for a walking workout of at least 30 minutes.;
, Wear flexible clothing, such as yoga pants or baggy shirts. Put a towel and 16 to 24 oz. (473 to 710 ml) of water on your treadmill for a healthy and safe workout.
 This is 220 minus your age. You should aim to be at 70 percent of your maximum heart rate for most of your workout, according to your treadmill's heart rate monitor.


If your treadmill does not have a heart rate monitor, you may choose to invest in a monitor that goes around your wrist, arm or stomach in order to ensure you are exercising at aerobic levels, as recommended by most doctors.
 If you plan to run or climb, you will want to warm up between 3 and 4 mph (4.8 and 6.4 km/h).
 Increase the MPH to between 5 and 6, and speed walk or jog. If you are climbing, increase the incline to between 3 and 4.
 Stay at this pace for 2 minutes.
 Experiment with raising the incline as you speed walk or jog to between 1 and 3 for a little extra resistance during your 1 minute sprints. If you are climbing, adjust your interval to between 5 and 6 for your sprints, and lower it to between 1 and 3 during your resting periods.
 Follow your treadmill workout with resistance training, small weight training or mat exercises.


For longer exercise routines, do a 10-4 interval time. Rest for 10 minutes and speed up for 4 minutes.
