,,, How you do this step depends on what part of the song you want.


If you just want the first part of the song, keep Start Time at 0, and enter "2:51" for the end time.
If you want another part of the song, play it through and note where the section you like begins. Enter that as the start time, then add 2 minutes and 51 seconds to that for the end time.
