 How big is it? Is it safely fenced? Does it have a deck that children could fall off? Make a list of any potential hazards!;
, This is important because depending on how old they are and other factors lists the dangers they might put themselves in.
 Is it fenced in? If it is, could the fence be climbed over or harm your child (Spikes, etc.) If you don't have a fence, go to a store (such as Rona or Home Depot) and buy a safe fence that is preferably flat and of tall/medium height. There are lots of different types of fencing, so if you like that sort of thing, find one that complements your home and garden!

, If you don't have a deck, then you can skip this step. If there is a hole between the deck floor and bench that children could crawl through, fall into the lower garden, and hurt themselves, either put short fencing over the gap so the hole is too small for anyone to climb through, or put boards cardboard, or plastic in front of it so there is no gap showing.
 Children can fall down the stairs and injure themselves, so this is important. Put something relatively soft at the bottom of the stairs, so that if they fall, they won't seriously harm themselves. Make sure they're wearing appropriate footwear. If it's raining, give them rain boots for just a bit of added protection! Remember though, if your child is quite young, you should always make sure you accompany them walking down the stairs.
 Do what feels right, and think in your child's mind.
 Give them the rules and boundaries, and how to be safe. Just telling them lets them know about being safe, and it helps!
