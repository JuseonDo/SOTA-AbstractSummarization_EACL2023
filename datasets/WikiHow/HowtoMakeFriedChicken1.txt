 Remove the skin and tendons from the chicken. Put the chicken fillets between two sheets of plastic food wrap or parchment paper and pound with a rolling pin. The aim is to flatten them evenly to about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) (1/2") in depth. The flattened pieces are now known as escalopes.;
, Add the diced pieces to the food processor and process into breadcrumbs. Pour them into a shallow, wide bowl or dish.
 Brush each escalope with mustard and sprinkle over the chopped fresh herbs.
 Be sure to coat both sides evenly.
 Seek to coat as thoroughly as possible.
 Add about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) (1/2") of oil to the pan.
 Fry in the shallow oil for about 4–5 minutes. They are done when they are brown.
 Drain on paper.
 If you are cooking one at a time, keep the fried ones warm in the oven until serving time.
