Quality tools, such as drill bits, will make a difference in this process because of the degree of difficulty and the expense of the steel itself.;

Mark the spot to drill with a permanent marker.
Frame the drill target with duct tape to keep your focus and protect the adjacent area.



Hold the center punch perpendicular to the spot and wrap it firmly, but sharply, with a hammer to dent the steel in order to spot the drill and to prevent the drill bit from easily wandering from the mark.
