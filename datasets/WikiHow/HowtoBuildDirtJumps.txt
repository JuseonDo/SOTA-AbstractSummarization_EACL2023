@summary
mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts).

@summary
compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them.

@summary
add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down.

@summary
make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section.

@summary
focus on a set up that flows.

 The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.

Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt.
Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.

, Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.
 In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable.
 Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.
 If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.
