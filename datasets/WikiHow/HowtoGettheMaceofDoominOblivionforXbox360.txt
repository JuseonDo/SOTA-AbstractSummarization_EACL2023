,, Once you read it, press the blue X button.
, If you look to your sides, you'll see circles in the floor.
 The wall will move to the side, revealing a new room with portals and more in it.
 Stand either on the portal you're on, or go near the highest plant hill.
 Go to wherever your save is and find Oblivion.
 Find the file labeled "Wizard's Tower". Delete it. Now, start Oblivion.
 A message will appear. Hit yes, and the game will load. Once loaded, you should be in a house. You might recognize the house from a certain quest. Now, go outside. You are in the place (no one really knows for sure) the developers of the game dumped the weapons and tested the cities, physics, etc. Now, there should be a fire. Near the fire, the Mace of Doom lays, just waiting for you to get it. Pick it up.
 Fast Travel to anywhere. Save and go back to the dashboard.
, You're done!
