;
, Run 2 lb (.9 kg) of Brussels sprouts under cold running water, and peel off any yellow leaves.
 Cook them until they're tender -- when they're ready, you should be able to stick a fork in them.
 Once they're tender, all you have to do is season them, and they're ready to eat. Season the Brussels sprouts with the salt, pepper, and butter. Then, enjoy them while they're hot.
