, Stir the butter as it melts and don't let it burn or turn brown. Once the butter is melted, add the flour, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together until the mixture is smooth and no clumps of flour remain. Cook it over medium heat until it starts to thicken and bubble.
 Keep stirring the milk until it is completely mixed in. Removing the saucepan from heat first will prevent the milk from cooking too quickly and scorching.
 Stir the mixture constantly with a whisk to prevent scorching or a skin forming on top.
 Combine the ham, onion, green pepper (if using) and cheese in a large bowl first, then stir them into the sauce using a spatula. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined.
 If you have not already done so, wash, peel, and slice the potatoes as thinly as possible, about ⅛-inch (0.32 centimeters) thick, then stir them into the sauce. Be gentle so that you don't "break" the potato slices. Keep stirring until the potatoes are evenly coated with the sauce.
 Spread it around with a spatula so that it covers the bottom of the dish in a thick, even layer. Make sure that there are no potato slices sticking upwards.
 You can cover the potatoes with the lid that came with your casserole dish, or you can use a sheet of tinfoil. The potatoes should be soft and tender once the baking time is up. If they are not fully cooked, bake them for another 10 minutes.
 This allows the sauce to thicken and give the scalloped potatoes and creamier texture. After this, you can serve them.
