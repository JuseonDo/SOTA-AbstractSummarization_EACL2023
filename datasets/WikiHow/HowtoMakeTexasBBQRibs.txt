 The amount of charcoal to use will depend on the number of slabs and the quality of the charcoal. One slab of ribs will require about 2 pounds of charcoal.;
, If your grill has more than one vent, close all but the one you have placed the coal to. This will help to keep the coals burning while retaining most of the smoke in the grill.
 Spread the coal out evenly across the bottom of the grill.
 They should be placed on the side of the grill that is away from the coals. Close the lid for one hour and keep it closed. At the one hour mark open the lid and flip over and rotate the ribs placing them away from the coal.
 Baste the ribs with vinegar and salt, which you mixed earlier. Close the lid again.
 If the ribs are ready when you gently tug or pull on the ribs and the bone comes away from the meat, the ribs are almost done. If done, turn the ribs up and baste with barbecue sauce. Be sure to slather the ribs with BBQ sauce and be sure bone side is up.
 Cook the ribs for 15 minutes more. Then open the ribs and slather BBQ sauce on the other side, and leave on the grill for 15 minutes more with the lid closed.
 The ribs will brown up quickly after you put the sauce on. Do not close the lid.
 Boy them there ribs smell mighty good. What do you think?

, It's time to remove them from the grill. Once again load on the BBQ sauce, place the ribs in tin foil and tightly wrap. Place the foil and ribs back on the grill. Let the ribs cook for 30 minutes or so.
