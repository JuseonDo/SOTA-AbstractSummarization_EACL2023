 4. This guy can be found at the Land of Dragons (Mulan's world), at the palace gate (where you fought Shan-yu). This is the area before the throne room and antechamber.;
, You don't want these items because they have MP Haste abilities, and you don't want your MP for this at all since you'll be relying on Berserk Charge.
 This ability let's Sora unleash an uninterrupted set of attacks, which completely bypasses finishing moves, but only when he's out of MP.


You can also equip the Fatal Crest keyblade, which also has Berserk Charge as its unique ability.
 You'll want your MP gone in order to activate Berserk Charge. You’ll want to do this quickly because the finishing move in Wisdom form will cause Sora to stop moving for a second (to recover from the stance), and the mushrooms will hit you, resulting in a game over.
, Remember, the challenge is to kill 85 without getting hit, not even once.
 They will charge at you, but don't worry as long as you're moving, the chances of them hitting you is little to none.


As the number you've killed goes up, the more mushrooms will spawn to attack you, so don't ever stop going in circles around them!

, But time it correctly, or the small time frame between casting Curaga and Sora recovering from the magic stance can be fatal if a mushroom gets too close to you.
 Maximum count is 100, which is easily attainable.
