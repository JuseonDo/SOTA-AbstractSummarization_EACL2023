 Prepare the baking tray/sheet either by greasing or lining with baking/parchment paper.;
,, Mix until a smooth dough is formed.


If you find that the dough is a little too dry, add a little water.
, Roll both pieces of dough into two thin rounds. Try to make both even in height and keep the edges tidy.
 Use a fork to prick all over the dough rounds. Then, use a butter knife to gently mark six triangles.
 Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they turn a pale golden colour.
 While still warm, sprinkle with the caster/superfine sugar. Then, cut into the triangles. Transfer to the wire cooling rack to cool.
