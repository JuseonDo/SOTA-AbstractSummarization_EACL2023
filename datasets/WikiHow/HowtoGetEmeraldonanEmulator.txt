 Visual Boy Advance is a popular emulator. Visual Boy Advance can be found at http://emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html.;
, This ROM can be found at http://coolrom.com/roms/gba/14604/Pokemon_Emerald.php.
 This is a .exe type file. If it asks to always pop up the Window, uncheck "Don't ask me Again".
 Then chose the ROM (Emerald). It will start playing! You may want to go to Options>JoyPad>Configure>1 to understand the Different controls.
 Now close and repeat steps 3 & 4.
 Meaning put the code in the 'Code Here' Section and put the name of the Code in the 'Description'. To get codes, go to https://youtube.com and look up "Cheat codes for Emerald game shark".
 As in common sense, just unclick the box to disable the Code. This is a great way to capture all Pokémon, JUST CHEAT.
