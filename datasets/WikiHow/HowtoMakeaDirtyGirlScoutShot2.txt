 Make sure you leave enough room for your cocktail., If you'd like your drink extra cold, add a handful of ice into the shaker as well.
 Keep your hand over the lid so that it doesn't accidentally pop off.
 If you added ice into the shaker, you will need to pour the mixture through a strainer.
 The Dirty Girl Scout is typically left un-garnished, but you can top it with a few mint leave to make it look more interesting.
