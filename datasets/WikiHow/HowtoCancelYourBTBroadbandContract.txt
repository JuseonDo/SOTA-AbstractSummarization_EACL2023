 Their customer retention department will attempt to persuade you to stay and will usually offer you a better deal than you have now. If you aren't certain you want to leave then this could be a good time to negotiate a contract with them you would be happy with. Otherwise, just keep repeating that you want a MAC code and don't let yourself get distracted!;
, It is highly recommended you do this before leaving BT because MAC codes will expire so if you are moving provider use a comparison website to find a new broadband provider.
 Learn the following:


What your broadband deal is. This will be shown on your bill.
How far you are into your current contract. If this has expired than you may in some circumstances have no cancellation fee.
The name of the provider you are switching to where applicable.
 To get your cancellation fee you'll need to multiply the number of months remaining in your minimum term by £7.75 for Option 1 broadband, £11.50 for Option 2 and £11.75 for Option 3.
