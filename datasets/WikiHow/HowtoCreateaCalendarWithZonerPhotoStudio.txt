 Copy the images that you want to use. You can drag them there, but since it is on the same hard drive, it will move it if you do it that way. You don't necessarily have to only use 12. Have a lot there so that you have a lot of options for your calendar.;
,, Click on Create > Calendar.
 Verify that you have selected the ones you want.
 Those include A4, Letter, Legal, and many other options, including custom.
, This allows you a little more fine grained control than previously.
 The options are pretty basic here.
 Drag the picture you want in your first month, (August here), if the one that is showing isn't the one you want.
 Do this until you have all the images where you want. When you get to a month, the picture will already be there. You can leave it there or replace it with another. If the picture is in the wrong position (sideways or something), it is very easy to fix that.
 If you are sending it as a gift, export it to a PDF. If you don't have the option, you will need to download a PDF reader. There are many free ones on the Internet.
