 Choose a durable fabric, such as cotton, linen, canvas, or jersey. The fabric can be solid colored, or it can have a print on it.
 Choose a color that goes well with your bag. This will make the draw string that will open and close your bag.
 This will make the top of your bag. Be sure that you are folding the edge towards the wrong side of the fabric.
 The first line needs to be 2½ inches (6.35 centimeters) down from the fold. The second line needs to be 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) from the fold. The 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) space between the two lines will make the channel for the ribbon to go through.
 Secure the side and bottom edge with sewing pins. The fold will make the other side edge, and does not need to be pinned down.
 When sewing the side, skip the 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) space between the two lines you made earlier, or you won't be able to insert the ribbon. When you are done, remove the sewing pins.
 If you'd like, you can serge the side and bottom hems of your bag first so that they don't fray. If you don't have a serger, you can use the zigzag stitch on your sewing machine instead.
 Push the safety pin into one of the openings. Use the safety pin to guide the ribbon all the way around the bag until you reach the other opening. Be careful not to loose the end of the ribbon on the bag.
 Scrunch the fabric on the ribbon until the bag closes. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a bow. If you'd like, you can place a pretty bead onto each end of the ribbon; tie each end into a knot to hold the bead on.
