 Or go alone. At night.;
, Nighttime is recommended, or this article won't be much use to you. The timid might experiment with the back yard, or an abandoned street, or somewhere uncrowded--at night. The bold may aim for busy malls in the middle of the day but will want to consult our article about How to Go Streaking, which is more targeted to daytime escapades.
 If there is any chance you won't get your clothes back safely, put your underwear around your head so you will have some cover if needed. Those underwear can also come in handy if the police arrive unexpectedly.
 At night. Laugh. If you want attention, scream and yell.
 Watch the time and try to do this before the sun comes up. If you don't finish during the dark, you have not achieved your mission of streaking at night.
