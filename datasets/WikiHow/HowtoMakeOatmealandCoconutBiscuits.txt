, Beat thoroughly until well combined. Make sure that everything is evenly distributed.


Remember to omit the egg if you are using vanilla sugar.
 Make sure you allow air to get into the flour. When sifting, hold the sieve approximately 20cm (8 inches) from the bowl. If you hold it too high, you will end up losing some flour.
 Make sure it is well combined. Avoid stirring the ingredients together too much as the flour may clump up again and the biscuit will not be as light.
 Use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to fold the mixture together. Continue mixing until everything has completely combined.


At this stage, your mixture may be a bit dry. Add a small amount of milk to help it come together.
 Make sure you're not using greaseproof paper as it's not suitable for baking biscuits—greaseproof paper cannot withstand high heat.
 Ensure that you leave plenty of space between each biscuit as the biscuits will expand. You will not want to have one giant biscuit.
 If possible, place the biscuits on the middle rack of your oven. Remember to watch the biscuits very carefully to ensure that they don't burn.
 Be careful when doing this as the oven will be fairly hot. Use a tea towel or oven mitt to hold the tray while taking it out.
 Enjoy!
