, Hold on to the wall while you place the other foot on the pedal. Push down and balance yourself. You have to push forward not just down on the high pedal. If you push down and not forward, nothing will happen or you will go backward.
, Start in your original position and push hard on your right foot. Don't do it too fast or you'll lose your footing.
 Then just start to pedal.
 Have them stand on either side of you. Put a hand on each of their shoulders. Look straight ahead, find something to focus on and keep looking at it. Do not put your weight on the spotters shoulders. Just keep them there for support. Keep your weight on the seat, or your feet will wobble up and down and you will fall off. Most people can learn to ride forward on a unicycle using the method described in this writing, with a couple hours of practice a day for one week. So, unicycles up dudes! And remember never never ever ever ever give up!, You need a lot more practice before free-mounting, and you should ride beside the wall using it for balance before trying to ride away from the wall.
