 This can work with your on or off camera flash. Some useful items are:


White post it notes
Note cards with no lines
Printer paper
Card paper

For an on camera flash, fold the paper so that it comes between the flash and the subject. If you have a 3 * 5 notecard, those work great, but use the side without the lines.
For your off camera flash, you can use a band or scrunchy, or something like that, to fasten the paper to the flash.
