 You are using food coloring because it's safe if ingested. The more coloring you add, the redder the lip balm will be.


You can also put a few drops of yellow food coloring for an orange tinted lip balm, and of course, you can also use any loose eyeshadow and pigments instead or with the food coloring.
 Stir continuously.



Transfer to the microwave if you want the lip balm to look flat and new.
 Put it in the refrigerator to let it cool and harden.
