 Hit them over the head all the time with your bug net.;
, Push them around town until they yell at you to stop. Then do it again and they will get fed up with you.
 Some people have tried sending letters to them saying, "leave my town", but it isn't likely that works because they can't read what you've written. They just send one back saying something nice.
 If they ask you to deliver a letter or package, open it. If they arrange a play date, don't show up.
