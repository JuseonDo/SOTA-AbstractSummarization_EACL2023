,, When you shoot for reflections, you have to watch out for blowing out the high lights.
 This will help to ensure you have decent focus.
 Because you have reduced aperture, you will probably need longer exposure time.
 High noon is not a time for any reflections worth speaking of.
 You may need to use manual focus to do that.
 You may need to bump it up a step or two.
