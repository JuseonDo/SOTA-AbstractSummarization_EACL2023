Preheat the oven to 450 degree F (230 degree C). Place the raw breaded shrimp on their side on a parchment paper lined baking sheet, in a single layer. Spray them lightly with an aerosol oil-based spray to help them brown. Bake them for about 10 to 15 minutes depending on their size, or until when cut open they are opaque in color.
