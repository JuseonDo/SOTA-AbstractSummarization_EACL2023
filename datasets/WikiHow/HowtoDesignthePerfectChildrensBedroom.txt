 If funds are limited, stay away from designer furniture. It is not difficult to find furniture which is made from quality materials and available at inexpensive prices;
, If the room is small, or the children are sharing rooms, space may be at a premium. If that is the case, things like mid-sleeper beds offer the ideal solution. In addition to the bed, most mid-sleepers also consist of a variety of shelves, desks, drawers etc.
 Children often like to be creative so take the ideas of the child on board. The child will have to spend a lot of time in the room so the interior design should reflect his/her preferences.
 Due to their boisterous nature, children have a knack of unintentionally damaging things! Make sure you only purchase furniture manufactured from robust and durable materials.
 How sturdy is the bed? Will it collapse if the child jumps on it? Do the drawers and dressers have sharp corners? If so, many companies offer to round them out to ensure they do not cause harm to children.
