@summary
beware if you select a base-rolling drum because some are harder to operate than others.
@article
 Select a base-rolling tumbler with rollers or wheels on the base and steps built in so you can easily roll the drum with your feet to aerate and mix the compost inside.


Base-rolling drum tumblers are close to the ground, which makes the tumblers harder to empty. You must shovel out the composted material through small openings instead of just tipping the compost into a wheelbarrow.
