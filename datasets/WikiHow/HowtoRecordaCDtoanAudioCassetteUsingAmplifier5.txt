Put disk away and write down a title on the tape you copied to.
Insert new disk and continue recording on the tape if you have free space.
To record again, simply press record on the deck and the play button on the DVD/CD player as described in the previous step.
Don't forget to turn everything off and unplug your equipment when you're finished!
