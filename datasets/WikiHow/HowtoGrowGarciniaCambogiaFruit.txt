peel the coat off the 2-inch seed to reveal its white cotyledon.

@summary
immerse the cotyledons in a mixture of 550 ppm (parts per million) gibberellin (plant growth hormones) and water.

@summary
choose a planting container that is large enough to hold the seeds.

@summary
keep the seed-raising mix damp and warm.

@summary
keep the seedlings watered, mulched and fertilised once they take hold.

@summary
purchase a grafted tree rather than beginning one from seed if you have the opportunity, as grafted trees can flower in three to four years.

 Repeat for each seed you're preparing to plant.;
, Keep submerged for twelve hours.
 Plant each seed in the container. Plant the seeds deep in seed-starting mixture.
 Expect the seeds to take anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to germinate. Place the cotyledons in a water-based container for faster germination (this can speed up the germination process to between ten to twelve days).
 When they are strong enough, separate and plant them in separate containers or in the garden. Expect fruit in about seven to twelve years; this is a slow process. Refer to the following section for growing the tree itself.
 On the other hand, seedlings will take seven to twelve years before they can bear fruit.
 Opt for a protected location that has full sun with sandy soil. (See "Tips" below for soil hints.)

, Blend ten pounds of composted manure into the soil.
 When planting, ensure that its graft union is not over one or two inches higher than the bottom.
, Increase the amount of manure it receives little by little, until the fully grown tree is being given around one hundred pounds per year.
 It will produce its four-petal red or often yellow flowers in late winter or early spring. This will be followed by its apple-sized yellow or red fruit four or five months later, in mid-summer. Expect those fruits to fall after they are have ripened, at which point you can harvest them and enjoy their nutritional benefits.
