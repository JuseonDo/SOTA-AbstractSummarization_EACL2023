 Draw a circle and an oval for the dog-like muzzle. Add in guidelines for the face, connecting the shapes and a few where the eyes will be.
 Sketch in the nose, mouth, and ears. Start adding fur if you'd like, around the back of the head and the snout.
 Put a large circle below that, and a small oval for the posterior. Add in a relatively short, thick tail.
 Shape the hands; give them long fingers gripping the ground as shown in the image.
 The baboon's back right leg should be in front of the body and the left leg should be behind it, as though he's taking a step forward.
 Finish filling in the fur. The back right leg should be the furriest, and there should be tufts on the stomach.
 Use mostly brown or black (typical baboon colors) or in the pattern of Rafiki from The Lion King. Make sure no excess guidelines remain.
