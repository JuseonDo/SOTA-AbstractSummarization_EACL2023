 Remember, social media is a good way to communicate happy news, but only if you want all of your followers to know the good news. While thinking about what you want to say, you may want to avoid sharing too many personal details. (For example, saying "The Jones house is now expecting a new baby girl!" would be much better than saying "After many unsuccessful attempts at a pregnancy, 1234 Cherry Tree Lane is now expecting a new baby girl!").


Do not share your address online.
Avoid giving too many personal details.
Never give out credit card or social security information.
Don't tag any people who may be upset by your success.
Add a picture when appropriate and if you feel like it.
 Is it just Facebook news, or does it deserve a Tweet as well? Is there some way to Instagram it? These are the things you must consider.
