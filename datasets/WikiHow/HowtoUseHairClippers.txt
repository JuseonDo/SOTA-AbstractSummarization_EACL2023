 Every hair clipper comes with a number of attachments that allow you to cut your hair to different lengths. Many people choose to cut the sides of their hair shorter than the top.









The longest is a size 7 or 8, depending on the clipper, which leaves about an inch of hair on your head.
Using a guard shorter than a size 4 will show your scalp, which leaves you vulnerable to sunburn.;
, Never cut wet hair with clippers because this will cause the blades to rust.
, By going slowly, you not only ensure that you're giving a comfortable cut, but a smooth, even one as well. Your goal is to cut all the hair in one pass.
 Carefully cut a clean line at the back of the neck and around the ears. Go slowly so you don't make a mistake.
 This leaves the neck feeling smooth and comfortable.
 If you or the person whose hair you're cutting has facial hair, use a guard to provide a smooth transition from the sideburns to the beard.
 Use the oil that came with the clippers.
