 You will be working in small amounts, so any small-volume container will work.
 You will need 2 tablespoons of rosewater, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of gram flour. If you have dry, sensitive skin, you can also add 2 tablespoons of milk.
 You can use a spoon or fork to do this. If the paste is too thin, add some more flour. If the paste is too thick, add some more rosewater.
 Dip your fingers into the small bowl or cup and scoop some of the mask. Start spreading it across your face. Take care to avoid the sensitive areas around your mouth, nose, and eyes.
 The mask may start to drip down your face during this time, so it might be a good idea to lay down or sit in a chair with your head tilted back.
 Lean over the sink and splash your face with cool water. Gently massage your skin to ease off the mask. If there is any residue, you may have to wash your face with some face wash.
 You can use this mask up to three times a week.


Lemon juice makes your skin extra sensitive to the sun. To avoid getting sunburned, stay out of the sun after using this mask.
