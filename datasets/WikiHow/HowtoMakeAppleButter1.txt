 Wash the apples first, then peel them. After this, you can core them using an apple corer, and then cut them into quarters. If you don't own an apple corer, you can cut them into quarters first, then cut the core away with a knife.;
, Turn the heat up to high, and let the cider come to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat to low, and let the apples and cider simmer for 20 minutes., Stir in the sugar and spices, then turn the heat back up to high. Let the mixture come to a boil. As soon as the cider starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, and let the apples simmer for 30 minutes.For a twist, try 1½ cups (300 grams) of brown sugar and ½ cup (115 grams) of white sugar.If you'd like the apple cider to be sweeter, you can add up to 4 cups (900 grams) of sugar., Once the apples are soft, take the pot off the stove, and let the mixture cool down a little. You can then mash the apples using a potato masher, or purée them in a blender or food processor., The longer you cook it, the thicker it will become.You don't want the apple butter to be too thick, however; the mixture should be reduced by about 40 to 50%.The apple butter may splatter. Consider keeping a splatter screen of sorts over the pot to keep your kitchen clean., Wipe the mouths of the jars with a clean towel, then put the lids on.Store the jars in the fridge.
