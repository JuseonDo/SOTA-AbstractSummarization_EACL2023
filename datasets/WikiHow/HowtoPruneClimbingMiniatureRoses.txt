 Cut back dead or dying shoots to the healthy wood. All other shoots must be treated as follows.;
, On rose bushes, these are shoots that you would target for removal. For climbing miniature roses, however, these shoots remain important for continued climbing growth. Remove only the tips of these growing shoots.
 Fanning out long shoots is best done when the shoots are young and green (and therefore more pliable).
