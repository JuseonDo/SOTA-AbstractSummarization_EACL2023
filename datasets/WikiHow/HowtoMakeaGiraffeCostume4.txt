@summary
glue the open flaps of the bottoms together (make sure that the ends go over the headband) so that they stay on.

 The direct center of the headband should be between the horns.
 If you want, you can secure them with rubber bands.
 Wrap the bottom of the ear up and over the headband and glue it. Do the same with the left ear, except put it to the left of the left horn. Again, you can use rubber bands to secure these.
