, Grease the inside of the baking pan, then dust it with flour. Shake out any excess flour.

Try using an electric mixer for this; it will be faster., Keep mixing until you get a smooth texture and an even color., Pour the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves into a large bowl. Mix them together until everything is evenly dispersed., Pour the spiced flour mixture into the molasses-butter mixture. While you are pouring, stir everything together with a whisk or spatula. If you are using an electric mixer for this step, you might want to reduce the speed to the lowest setting possible so that the flour does not fly out everywhere., Keep mixing until everything is smooth.
 Start at one end of the pan and slowly move your way down to the other. If necessary, use a spatula to help guide the batter to the edges. Be careful not to scrape the bottom or sides of the pan., Avoid peeking into the oven. Each time you open the oven, you release heat. This will affect the baking time.
 You can decorate your cake however you want, but you might want to wait until it cools off completely before you do so. If you decorate your cake too soon, the frosting will melt and slide right off.
