,, To create a "T", use a stencil of a stretched rectangle. Tape the corners to prevent the stencil from moving. Use white fabric paint for the outline, yellow inside the outline. Wait until the paint dries, then move the stencil horizontally (or vertically if horizontally is done first) to repeat the process.
 Make sure the choker is measured half of your neck.
 Make sure the legs are 4 inches (10.2 cm) shorter than your legs.
