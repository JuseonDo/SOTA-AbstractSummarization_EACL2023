, The following are compound exercises for groups of muscles and the top 3 most effective for beginners and comprehensive for the whole body.

Press-ups instead of bench presses are good for upper body strength. Put your feet on your bed and your hands on the floor for incline press-ups and a wall for handstand press-ups.






Sit-ups or super sit-ups are great for core abdominal strength.






Squats or burpees are good for leg strength. So is using stairs rather than the elevator in buildings.
 Swimming in your local public pool is usually cheap and a good way to build strength. Jump rope or skipping rope is a cheap piece of equipment for cardio which takes up little space but easily as good as most other expensive equipment which takes up lots of space.
 You don't need an expensive iPod or Mp3 player. Most exercise videos only get watched once so borrow them from a public library if you must.



Skimmed Milk is cheaper than protein powder. Longlife or UHT is even cheaper.
Tuna and chicken are cheap meat and sources of protein.
Pasta, beans and nuts are cheap carbohydrates.
 Tap water if it is safe in your country.

Non-equipment cheap fitness gurus include Charles Atlas and Jack LaLanne.
