@summary
put the butterfly in through the small hole at the top.
@article
 Do not make loud noises or move the flower as it might fly off. Put your pointer finger and thumb slightly together at a sideways angle. Make sure that the butterfly doesn't notice you.;
, Press them together tightly so it can't fly off.
 The four fingers of the left hand must completely wrap around the at least the two last fingers of the right hand. The thumbs must be crossed over the top. This is a comfortable hand cage that you can put the butterfly into. Make sure there is a small hole at the top for the butterfly to breath. It should not let the butterfly escape.
 Do not squish the butterfly or close the hole. Press your other fingers together tightly to not allow the butterfly to get through. Let it free by simply separating your hands
