make sure that if you are going to put heat on your hair, you use some kind of protection so as not to get split ends.

 You don't want to wash your hair every single day though because that will make it lose its natural oils.


If your hair is short, you can look at inspirations such as Rihanna and Victoria Beckham for hairstyles whereas if your hair is on the longer side (shoulder-length and longer), you could look at Kim Kardashian and Beyonce for your inspiration.
 In order to work your hair, you could keep it straight, wavy, curly or afro centric but it should always have some kind of shine. You definitely don't want dull, frizzy hair. In order to do that, find some products that produce shine such as Garnier Fructis and TRESemm√©.
 It is best to air dry your hair instead of blow drying it to relieve it from all of the heat.
 It creates split ends and causes a lot of heat damage and the consequences are not worth it. Some appliances that may come in handy are: flat irons (for days where you want pin straight hair), curling wands (where you want lose waves and no creases in your hair from the clamps of curling irons), curling irons (for days where you want big, glamorous curls) and blow dryers (when time is running out and you don't have time to air dry).
