 This recipe is convenient because these ingredients can be found in every kitchen. You will only need some honey, salt, flour and water., You can use equal parts honey, flour, water and salt. Since you are only waxing your eyebrows, you shouldn't need more than 2 or 3 tablespoons of each.
 The yellowish fluid will likely seem too watery. Once the mixture is heated it will thicken quite a bit.
 Monitor the mixture as it will begin to boil up when it is ready.Remove the wax from the microwave.


Be careful, the wax will be hot.
 This will allow the mixture to cool so you do not burn your skin. The mixture will also thicken as it cools giving you a thick, sticky wax.
