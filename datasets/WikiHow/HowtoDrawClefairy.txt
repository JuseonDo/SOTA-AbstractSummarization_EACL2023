 Make sure you're using a pencil and not a permanent tool because this is only a guide circle.
 Draw a line just above the middle of the triangles for the tips., Also draw the arms, which are basically two thick ovals. Again, don't use anything permanent to draw this because you will erase part of it for the three fingers., These are the tips of the feet., Draw two small ovals below the right and left sides of the tuft of hair and a mouth with a single tooth below those. Also draw ovals that represent blushing cheeks.,
