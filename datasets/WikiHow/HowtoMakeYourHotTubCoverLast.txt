 If you're lucky enough to live in a sunny location, a quality UVA/UVB vinyl protectant is mandatory. Apply as directed 3-4 times a year. DO NOT use 'Armor-All' brand protectant as it contains petroleum distillates and damages vinyl long-term. A quality saddle soap or marine application protectant is good, or try '303' spray.;

 This plastic bag envelopes the foam core, keeping it dry. As soon as a small hole is made, the foam cores are so dry, they will wick in moisture slowly and get heavier and heavier, causing extended wear and tear to your cover. Repair the plastic liner with good quality clear postal mailing tape.
 Most cuts can be glued from the back side by adding a small scrap over cut and putting tape on front side, pulling it back into shape. A good vinyl glue (VPL) can be found at most auto parts stores.
 This should be done once a year, or twice a year if your tub is 7' or bigger.
