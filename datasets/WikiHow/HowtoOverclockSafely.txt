 This way you will know what is considered dangerous for the lifespan of your hardware. Voltages, thermal limits and sensitive buses(e.g. PCI express) should be your primary concerns.
 These should give you an idea of what to do and what to avoid. Read every warning carefully.
 High temperatures lead to component failures. Since overclocking increases heat output you must compensate for that by installing cooling devices such as heat pipe coolers or water cooling loops.
 You will know when to stop if you proceed like this as instability will be easier to notice and eliminate by going back to the previous safe setting.
 This is the only way to reset the BIOS if your computer doesn't boot.
 Instability may be a hint of a hardware malfunction which will cause damage in the future. After setting the clock speed you want test for at least 24 hours.
