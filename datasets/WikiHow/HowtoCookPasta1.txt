 Try to pick one that suits the sauce well. It's best to use pasta that is a brand from Italy and is made of 100% durum wheat semolina.
 This will ensure that the water doesn't spill when it's boiling. Don’t under-fill the pot; this will make the pasta sticky. There should be a generous water-to-pasta ratio. To reduce your wait time, add hot water.
, For a large pot of water, 1 or 2 tablespoons of salt should be sufficient.
, Take care that the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom, especially when you first add it.









Since it can be hard to estimate just how much pasta you need, read the package for serving suggestions. If there aren’t any, read the Nutrition Facts for the number of servings per container and divvy up the dry noodles accordingly. If you’re cooking for two, a full package of pasta can usually make a full meal with leftovers.
 Do not cover the pot; traditional Italian pasta is cooked without a lid.










Alternatively, under-cook the pasta by 2-3 minutes (the outsides should be cooked while the centers should be hard), then turn off the stove, set the pot on another (cool) burner, and cover for 10-15 minutes. This will slow-cook the centers of the pasta, making them al dente instead of soggy.
 If it's too hard to bite or if you see white in the center, it needs to cook a little longer. When it's cooked all the way through but still firm, it's ready. This is referred to as al dente (“to the tooth”) in Italian.
 Tilt the pot away from yourself so you don’t get a face full of steam, which is even hotter than the boiling water.
 Be sure not to put the pot back onto the hot part of the stove, which can burn the bare pasta.
 While this will keep the noodles from sticking, it can also create a barrier between the noodle and the sauce you add, making the results less flavorful.
 See several recipes below for ideas.
