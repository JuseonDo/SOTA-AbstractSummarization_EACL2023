parkour is also about knowing your limits, if you don't think you can do something, practice small, and work your way up to it!

 For example, a roll from right shoulder to left hip or left shoulder to right hip (not a somersault). This is the most important move in Parkour, as it is essential for landing jumps while preserving your forward momentum, allowing you to continue running. There are a few variations to the roll, such as the dive roll, but remember, Parkour is not as easy as it looks. A roll in Parkour is meant to 'flow', allowing you to preserve your forward momentum and continue running. While you may think you have 'mastered' the roll, remember to keep practicing the basics, even once you have gone far beyond them.;
, If you are just beginning with Parkour, this is one of the best ways to go, because learning straight from others is much better than watching videos on YouTube.
 There's no such thing as practicing too much.
 Parkour, while a great work out in itself, is not enough to keep going, if you want to get better, you need to condition your body. Go for runs, go to the gym, etc. Also, your body, namely your knees, take a lot of impact. You want to condition them to be able to take the abuse.
