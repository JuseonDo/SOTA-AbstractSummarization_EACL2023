@summary
build a pen to contain your animals.

@summary
make sure you’re holding the breeding food in your hands.

@summary
look for an animal you want to domesticate, and get it to follow you.

@summary
enclose them in the pen.
@article
 It is preferable that the pen is close to your house or farm.



Domesticating cows and sheep require wheat, chickens require seeds, and pigs require carrots.
 You can do this by holding the breeding food and standing near the animal until they look at you and start to walk towards you. You can then walk away slowly, and they will follow you. If you walk away too fast they will lose track of you and stop following you.
 When you feed them the breeding food, they shouldn’t respawn and should remain in the pen.
