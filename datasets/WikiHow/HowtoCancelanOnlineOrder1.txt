 Take screenshots of important customer service numbers and links. If you need to cancel the order, you will have easy access to the company’s cancellation procedure.;
, Some e-commerce websites are better than others for canceling orders. Most big name retailers and Amazon has a cancellation procedure in place, while some consumer-to-consumer sites, like eBay may not allow order cancellations on some purchases.


If the retailer doesn’t list a cancellation policy, but you follow up, courts and credit card companies often still file in favor of the customer. If the company says that cancellations are not accepted, it is unlikely that you will receive support through your credit card company., Your best bet for a full cancellation and refund is to catch it before it ships.
 Then, click “Cancel” or fill out the cancellation form with your name, email, phone number, confirmation number, order number and a reason for the cancellation.
 Make sure to include your name, email, phone number, confirmation number, order items, order number and a reason for the cancellation.
 This is faster than email if the website has a 24-7 customer service line. It is a good idea to try both the email/order cancellation form method and call to ensure your cancellation is received., The customer service rep may give you a confirmation number by phone. Keep this for future reference.
 Note that some refunds take 30 days to show up on your billing statement.


Follow up if the money is not credited within 15 to 30 days.
