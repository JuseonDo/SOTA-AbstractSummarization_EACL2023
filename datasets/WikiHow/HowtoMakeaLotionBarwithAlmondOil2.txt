 If you don’t own a double boiler, make one using a pan filled halfway with water, topped with a non-combustible bowl. For best results use a tin bowl instead of glass (to avoid the possibility it could shatter during the cooking process).


Turn the heat to low or medium low to allow the water to simmer.
 Mix 1/5 of the lb. bar of beeswax and allow that to melt first.
 As you add the oils, stir slowly to integrate the oils into the beeswax.
 Be sure you don’t allow any water to drip into the mold from the bottom of the bowl or double boiler as water could compromise the quality of the lotion bar.
 No need to refrigerate although you could if you prefer (to speed the setting process).
 If necessary you could warm up the bottom of the pan (slightly) to make the removal process easy, however bars should slide out since they are made from wax and oil.
