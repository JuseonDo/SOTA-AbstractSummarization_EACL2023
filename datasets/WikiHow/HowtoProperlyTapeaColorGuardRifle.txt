 Be sure the screws go in straight. Forcing them in when they are not aligned will result in damage. Such damage will loosen the screws, make them a hazard while you are working with the rifle.
 Take care to not rip off the cushioning or loose pieces of wood underneath. Take care to watch out for splinters.
