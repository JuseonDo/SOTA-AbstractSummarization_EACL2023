 If you want to get that Rainbow Feather, you need to order it from the catalog. You will have to work for him in order to order it.
 Go in the hats section of the catalogs and you will find the rainbow feather for only 440 bells. Order it then you get it in the mail! It's that easy. Much easier than donating 700,000,000 bells.
