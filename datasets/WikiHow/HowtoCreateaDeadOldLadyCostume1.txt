 You can also find a floral, long-sleeved dress that goes just below the knees from a thrift store for a few dollars. Look for something that is a little baggy and frumpy to exaggerate the look of a woman from a different age group and era.;
, You can also choose some large clip on earrings.
 The contrast with your dress will add to a more exaggerated look.
 They should look intended for comfort, with thick soles.
 These gray, curly wigs are available in most costume shops and online.


Alternatively, you can also curl your hair and pin it up. Once it is set with hair spray, you can cover your hair with baby powder or flour to make it look gray.
 Follow any lines near the edge of your eyes, mouth and nose that wrinkle when you smile to get an idea of where your wrinkles would naturally be. Cover your face with liquid foundation and gently blend the wrinkles in until they look more natural.
 Cat eyeglasses or glasses with very large frames are preferable. If possible, attach a chain to the glasses.
 You can carry a clutch, add a cane or walker or a small hat to make your costume seem more authentic.
