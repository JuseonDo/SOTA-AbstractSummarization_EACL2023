 Have around 4 pillows on each side of your bed. If it's a double bed, then have a brightly coloured throw at the end for a glam look. You do not have to use those pillows to sleep on as it will probably hurt your neck. If you do want to use a couple of pillows, use thinner ones that won't hurt your neck.;
, Mirrors are great for that a-list feel. Big venetian glass mirrors on the wall are perfect. And you'll feel as though the room is bigger.
 Unlighted, scented candles are brilliant. Never light candles in your bedroom unless you have short one which you will need to throw away straight away. Try to use your candles more for decoration than well, candles!

, If you don't want a light shade then have a fancy light, like a chandelier or something like that.
 Have say, cream duvets and peach pillows rather than yellows and pinks and reds, as you will not open your eyes in the morning and feel like seeing bright colours. Instead go for bright ornaments as this will make them stand out and they still keep your room calm and quiet.
, It doesn't have to be a real plant-just some fake flowers are great for an a-lister.
 Include a calendar and other important stuff like that, Your friends won't envy you if you have a messy room
