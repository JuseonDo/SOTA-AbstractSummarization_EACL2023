,, To make it really tough, perhaps wrap in several layers and use some tough tape.
 The purpose is to make unwrapping difficult.
 One person per team must roll a pair of dice.
 The first player to get roll doubles tries to unwrap the gift. In the meantime, the other teams keep rolling to try to get a double before the gift is unwrapped. If they get a double, the gift immediately passes to the winner of the roll and so on.
 The one who finishes unwrapping the gift can keep the gift if you like; this can add a sense of urgency to the game.
