 This is harder than it sounds, and creating a forum that is similar in theme to existing and well established forums is a bad idea. Very few people will leave their current forum to move to your new, small forum. Many people have invested lots of their time into a forum, and they will not give that all up just to join your forum.;
, Having some people working with you will make things a lot better, and you will be able to support each other when the going gets tough.
 where to host the website that the forum will be on. There are many free forum hosting providers, however, they will give you a subdomain, such as (your forum name).freeforums.org, which may look unprofessional. Alternatively, you can purchase a domain name and hosting from a web host.
 This is often the most important decision during the creation of the forum, as it can be hard to switch to a different forum software without losing all your existing forum posts. SMF (simple machines forum) is free, and has very few public exploits, meaning it is very secure and is unlikely to be hacked. Other popular forum software includes vBulletin, MyBB and PhpBB.
 The MySQL database is where forum posts and member information will be stored.
 Initially, keep to a maximum of maybe 10 boards. Do not have too many off-topic discussion areas, just one 'general discussion' area will do initially.
 Many new forum users are too shy to post new threads on their own.
