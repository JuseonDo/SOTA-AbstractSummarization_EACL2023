,, Double-click on the file to select it. You should notice that the "Video source", "Audio source" and "Output file name" fields now contain file path information. This is good.
 A "Lossless" file (eg. a WAVE file) will have the best possible quality sound, but will also have a much larger file size. In addition, a "Lossless" file will be created more quickly due to the fact that no compression needs to be performed, which means that the computer needs to do much less work. For most uses, however, a "Lossy" file (eg. an MP3 file) will be sufficient. While they do take more time to output, they are a great deal smaller and more portable, and can still have excellent sound quality.
 Browse for the folder where you would like to save your WAVE file, choose a suitable file name (making sure that it ends in .wav) and hit "Save". Alternatively, you can adjust the default WAVE settings by clicking on the "Setting" button next to the "Audio" field near the bottom and choosing from the options available in the "Attributes" dropdown box (leave "Format" on PCM). Generally speaking, a higher sampling rate equals better quality. When you are happy with the settings, hit "OK" and then save the file.
 Browse for the folder where you would like to save your MP3 file and then click on the "Setting" button next to the "Audio" field near the bottom. Change the "Format" to "MPEG Layer-3". You may wish to adjust the quality of your MP3 file by choosing the sampling rate from the "Attributes" dropdown box, or you can leave it on the default setting, which should be just fine for most uses. When you are happy with the settings, hit "OK" and then save the file. IMPORTANT: Make sure that your file ends in .mp3.
