, Turn off the heat under the dutch oven and place the chuck roast back inside, resting it over the vegetables.


If you don't have a dutch oven, place the vegetables and chuck roast into a 3 inch (7.6Â cm) deep roasting pan. For best results, use stainless steel, though a nonstick roasting pan works well.
You can add other ingredients, such as potatoes and herbs, along with the vegetables and roast. herbs and arrange around the roast. You can use whole small potatoes or quartered large potatoes.
 If you don't want to use wine, use stock, broth, juice, vinegar or a combination of liquids.
 The cover allows the meat to remain moist while cooking.
 Use a meat thermometer to determine the roast is done cooking. The internal temperature should reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).
 This lets the juices redistribute throughout the roast so the end result is a juicy piece of meat. Serve alongside the potatoes and vegetables.
