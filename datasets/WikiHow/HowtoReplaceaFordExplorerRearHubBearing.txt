Have an assistant press the brake pedal to keep the axle from turning.





;
, A new nut is recommended and usually comes with the bearing.
 Hold the caliper out of the way but do not allow it to hang by the brake hose. Hanging the caliper from the brake hose can cause internal damage to the brake hose. The brake caliper will slide off of the hub once the caliper is removed.


Do not damage the boot while separating the toe link from the knuckle.



Do not damage the boot while separating the ball joint from the knuckle.



Do not use a hammer to separate the outboard CV joint from the hub. Damage to the threads and internal CV joint components may result.
 The axle basically floats inside the hub and you can usually push slightly on the end of the axle to make sure it is disengaged from the hub.
, Doing this yourself is not recommended unless you have access to a heavy duty press with all of the proper adapters. Improper equipment or experience can cause damage to the new bearing, knuckle assembly, and could also cause bodily harm.,
