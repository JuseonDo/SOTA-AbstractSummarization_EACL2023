 Its easier to learn these as the 10 are the same as the 8 precepts, but with precept No. 7 broken into two:


Abstain from singing and dancing (etc)
Abstain from using cosmetics, scents (etc).
, Some of these seem over the top or impossible in day to day life, but their whole point is a way to go without doing things you and others won't feel bad about. It's a starter kit to avoid stress and to build a lifestyle that avoids regrets.
