 It is the strongest Pre Hardmode sword.;
, Mine as much Crimtane ore as you can. An alternative to this is to Beat the Eye of Cthulhu in a Crimson world. You need 15 Crimtane Bars, which means you need 45 Crimtane ore to make the Blood Butcher, the first ingredient of Night's Edge. If you have a corrupt world, you can substitute with a Light's Bane.
 First, you will need to Beat Skeletron. Then, open Golden Chests until you find the Muramasa.
 Mine Hellstone ore (you need 60, plus 20 Obsidian.) To make Hellstone Bars, you need a Hellforge, which you can [[Find a Ruined House in Terraria|find in a Ruined House. Craft 20 Hellstone Bars and make a Fiery Greatsword.
 You need to mine 45 Demonite ore to make your 15 Demonite Bars. Once you get 15 Bars, craft Light's Bane.
 Once you do, kill Hornets until you have 15 Stingers, and find 12 Jungle Spores. Combine these to make the Blade of Grass.
 You will get Night's Edge, the first ingredient of the Terra Blade.
 A few guides on how to beat the Wall of Flesh are found here and here.
 Place it inside your base.


There are three Mechanical Bosses: Destroyer, The Twins, and Skeleton Prime. A guide to beating Skeletron Prime is described here.
 They have a 1/20 chance of occuring every day.
, They have a chance to drop Broken Hero Swords. You need three (two before patch 1.3.0.1) Broken Hero Swords to craft the Terra Blade.
 Then combine Excalibur and a Broken Hero Sword to make True Excalibur.
 Continue to slaughter Swamp Things and Frankensteins.
 Congrats, you now have one of the strongest swords in the game!
