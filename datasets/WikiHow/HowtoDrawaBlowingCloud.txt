 They should somewhat resemble a worm, and will form the body of your cloud. Make it so that the circles form a curve bending down.
 This time, only use six circles. Also, this curve should be bending up., Erase any excess guidelines within the actual cloud, but keep the outline formed by your circles., Bend the tips so they point down. For the eyes, draw two nearly-straight lines (since the cloud has its eyes shut)., Do the same for the cheeks, but with the curves bending inwards., Remember, this last one will be partially covered by the body of the wind., Use a bright blue or grey for the cloud and a darker tone to outline everything. Shadowing can really emphasize certain points of your drawing, and the same is true for almost everything else you do with clouds.
