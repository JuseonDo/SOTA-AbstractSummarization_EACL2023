 Look for a sparsely populated area on the wall for your framed vase.;
, You could mount a picture frame directly on the wall and then float the vase in the middle or you could purchase a framed picture, remove the glass and mount the vase in the middle.
 What kind of expression are you hoping to make with your artwork and what kind of flowers and color will compliment your style.
 Not only should you take size into account, you should also consider actual shape. For the most part, a rectangular vase or a vase with a flat back works well in terms of mounting.
 Pick up frame, vase, flowers and paint. You will also need a picture hanging kit for the frame.
 Make sure the spray mount is compatible for mounting glass objects.
