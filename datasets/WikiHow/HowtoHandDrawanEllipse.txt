The major axis is the longest diameter of an ellipse.;
,,


This is done by taking the length of the major axis and dividing it by two.



This is started by taking the compass and setting the spike on the midpoint, then extending the pencil to either end of the major axis.


The minor axis is the shortest diameter of an ellipse.




Here, you take the protractor and set its origin on the mid-point of the major axis. Mark the point at 90 degrees. Then swing the protractor 180 degrees and mark that point. Now you can draw the minor axis at its midpoint between or within the two marks.



Do it the same way the previous circle was made.



This is done by setting your protractor on the major axis on the origin and marking the 30 degree intervals with dots. Then you can connect the dots through the center with lines.



These will be parallel to the major axis, and go outward from all the points where the inner circle and 30 degree lines intersect. Try to draw the lines near the minor axis a little shorter, but draw them a little longer as you move toward the major axis.



These will be parallel to the minor axis, and go inward from all the points where the outer circle and 30 degree lines intersect. Try to draw the lines near the minor axis a little longer, but draw them a little shorter as you move toward the major axis. If you detect a horizontal line will be too short you can take a ruler and extend it a little before drawing the vertical line.

With free hand drawing, you do your best to draw the curves by hand between the points.
