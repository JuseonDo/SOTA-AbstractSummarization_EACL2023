 Before you commit to trapping groundhogs in a live trap and releasing them elsewhere, be sure to check with your stateâ€™s wildlife agency about relocating trapped wildlife, as laws vary from state to state., Place it trap directly in front of the burrow entrance. It can be helpful to spray it with a hose and roll it in dirt to help camouflage it., Place a brick on top of the cage to help prevent the animal from rolling it over once trapped., Place sticks, dirt, and leaves inside and around it,and then set the trigger. This will vary slightly depending on the trap you purchased. Follow the instructions on the packaging carefully.
 A trapped groundhog is an unhappy groundhog, and the longer you leave it in the trap the more likely it is to injure itself in distress.Once you have trapped a groundhog, handle the cage only while wearing thick gloves, and hold it away from your body.
 Transport it at least 5 miles away from your property, to an area that will be attractive to it as a new home. While groundhogs are not usually aggressive, you should stand back as it exits the trap.
