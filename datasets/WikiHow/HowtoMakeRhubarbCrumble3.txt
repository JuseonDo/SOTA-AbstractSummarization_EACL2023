 Make sure that the baking rack is in the center of the oven., Cut the leaves off, and throw them away immediately into the trash. Trim the bottoms of the stalks, then rinse them well. Pat the stalks dry, then cut them into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) long pieces.

You must cut the leaves off all the way. The leaves are toxic.
 Add the rhubarb first, then the sugar, and finally the gelatin mix. Do not stir., You can use plain white or yellow cake mix.For a richer crumble, use the type of cake mix that also has pudding in it.Cut the butter into small cubes first, then melt it in the microwave or in a small saucepan over the stove.
 It is ready when the filling starts to bubble, and the top turns a golden-brown color., Serve it cold with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
