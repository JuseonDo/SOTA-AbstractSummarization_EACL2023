Designs could also be a word, name or even a symbol of your home, business or property.
, When gluing the string in place, wrap the sides of each length of string down onto the sides or base of the wooden block for secure attachment.

Make stationery notes or paper
Mark envelopes with a special stamp

Posters, etc.
