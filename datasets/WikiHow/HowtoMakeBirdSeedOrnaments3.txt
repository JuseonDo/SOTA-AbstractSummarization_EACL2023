 To make the bread easier to work with, allow it to get slightly stale but do not let any mold grow on it. The slices of bread should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) thick.


If the bread is not stale, bake it in an oven set at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (148.9 degrees Celsius) for 10 minutes, or until it becomes completely hard and crusty.
 Cut out a small hole in the center to tie thread or yarn through later.
 Mix the nuts and seed together so that they are evenly distributed.
 You can use either smooth or crunchy peanut butter.
 Drop the bread in peanut butter side down. Press the ring into the seed until the peanut butter is well-coated in seed and nuts.
 Let the ring sit seed side facing up.
 Use as many hard rings of bread as you have available.
 Allow them to chill overnight.
 Tie the yarn to form a loop, and slip the loop over a tree branch outside.
