 Naturally occurring antihistamines will help relieve the discomfort caused by hives. Antihistamines will also diminish the amount of fluid under your skin (which is what causes the visual bumps associated with hives).


There are plenty of herbal antihistamine capsules available at health-food stores or drug stores.
Look for pills that contain stinging nettle or coltsfoot., Foods high in vitamin C include:


Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc.)
Green, leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and kale.Berries and tomatoes.
 Many herbs contain helpful antihistamines, and herbal tea is an easy way to intake plenty of healthy herbs.


Focus on drinking herbal tea, green tea, and chamomile teas.
