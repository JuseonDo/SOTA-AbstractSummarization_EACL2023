 You are looking for a place that you can slide something between the wiper arm and its base. This will allow you to remove the arm.
 Using a windshield wiper arm remover is best, however a flat head screwdriver can also be used to do the initial prying needed.Slide your tool under the base of the wiper arm and use it to pry the arm loose from the base or drive post.
 This will protect the paint and/or plastic around the base of the wiper arm as you pry.
 This will increase the space between the flange or lip of the wiper arm and the base of the arm. As the arm loosens, you will be able to pull it off of the base.
 Gently rock the wiper blade back and forth while lifting with both hands and remove it from the drive post.
