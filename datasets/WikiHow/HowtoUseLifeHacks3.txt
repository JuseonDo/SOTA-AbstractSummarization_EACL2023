 This is the perfect size, and will stay on. As an alternative, use Command Strips, or other sticky hooks that hold well.
 These take up much less space, and actually hold large towels much better. It also helps them to dry faster.
 Use sticky magnetic so as to not damage your walls. Make sure all your clips are magnetic before attempting this.
 Before you try this in the bathtub, put a piece of paper inside the bag, then completely submerge it. If the paper is wet, then the bag is not completely waterproof, and should not be used. Ziplock bags work the best.
 This will scrub everything very well, and as the Scrubbing Bubbles say, "We work hard so you don't have to!"

, This will save the space of having a bedside table, and will give off much more light. To make a DIY one:


Buy some craft wire
Twist it using pliers
Attach Christmas lights to it

, Instead of buying an ugly beige one, use colorful fabric and sew one using an embroidery hoop. Find a sack/sew a sack, then wrap the top around the embroidery hoop and sew.
 Stir it around and start painting. For every half a liter of paint, add one teaspoon of vanilla essence or extract and mix with a paint mixer. In the end, the room won't smell like that terrible paint odor, but instead smell like pure vanilla.
