 You can use Skype to transfer files of any size to any of your contacts. If the connection gets interrupted, you'll be able to resume when you're both connected again.


Adding your songs to a ZIP file will make it easier to send them all at once.
 If you don't have your friends added, you'll want to add them before sending the file.


Enter the email address or Skype user name into the Search field, and then send them a contact request.
 You can share a file with a single person by starting a conversation with that person. If you have a group conversation, you can send the file to everyone in the group.
 You can then browse your computer for the ZIP file containing the music you want to share.


You can also drag and drop the ZIP file into the conversation to share it.
 As soon as you add the file to the conversation, your friends will be able to begin downloading it by clicking or tapping the file in the conversation window.
