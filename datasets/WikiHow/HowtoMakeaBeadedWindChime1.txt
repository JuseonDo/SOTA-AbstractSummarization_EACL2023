 You can drill as many or as few holes as you'd like, but try to space them evenly. Make sure that you are drilling all the way through the wood.


Can't find any driftwood? Use a branch or a dowel instead.;
, You will need one length of string for each hole that you made.


The strings don't all have to be the same length.
 Use a tight, double knot, and don't trim off the tail end.For a stronger hold, slip a crimp bead over the knot, and pinch it shut with a pair of pliers.Don't have bells? Use anything else that will make noise when clinked together. Metal charms, shells, and keys would all work great!

, Make sure to push the first couple of beads through both strands of string so that the tail end from the knot doesn't stick out. You can string the beads randomly or use a pattern. Leave a few inches/centimeters at the other end of the string empty.


Consider adding some metal and wood beads for an interesting effect., At this point, take a look at the chime, and decide whether or not you are happy with the length. If something is too long, pull a few beads off. You can make your wind chime look more interesting by varying the lengths.
 Make sure that the bead is large enough so that it doesn't slip through the hole in the wood.The bead will help keep the string in place.
 Thread it back through the last couple of beads on your chime, then cut off the excess., Tie the ends of the twine to itself with a knot to secure it.If you'd like something fancier, drill a hole into each end of the driftwood, then insert a small hook. Attach the hooks to a delicate chain.
