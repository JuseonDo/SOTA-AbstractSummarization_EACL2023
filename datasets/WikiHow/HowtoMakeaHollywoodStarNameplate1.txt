 Wooden star cut-outs are likely to be found in craft stores and home d√©cor stores. Choose one that is a good size for fitting your name inside of it.;
, You could paint it other colors, but these are more fitting colors for a Hollywood theme. Allow to dry, then paint another layer or two. Allow to dry before proceeding.


If you paint the star light red, consider painting a gold border all the way around the edges of the star.
 If it helps you to keep neat, use stencil letters or cut out cardboard templates from printed letters and attach these, then trace around them.
 Take care not to go over any lines; use a fine paintbrush for the edges. Allow to dry before proceeding.


If preferred, use a Sharpie marker to color in the letters.
 This step is optional but can add some pizazz to the design. Either use glitter glue or spread glue on the star where you'd like the glitter to go, then sprinkle on the glitter. Allow to dry before hanging.
 Simply brush over the whole design and allow to dry.


Be sure to follow any other instructions indicated by the packaging of the sealant chosen.
 Thread a cord, wire or filament piece through this and tie in a strong knot, to form a hanging loop.
 Depending on its size, either add a hook to the door for hanging from, or just hang it from the doorknob.
