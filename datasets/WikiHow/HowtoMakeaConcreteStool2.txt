 The concrete will most likely be smoothed already but use the tool if needed.
 Strategically place the legs inside the concrete, making sure you add the legs while the concrete is still wet and can absorb the legs. If necessary, hold the legs in place while the concrete sets.


Check that the leg ends are all aligned evenly, to avoid a wobbly stool!

, This can take up to 20 hours (see the packaging instructions). The concrete must be completely set before you remove the stool structure from the bucket.
