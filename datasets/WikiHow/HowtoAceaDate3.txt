@summary
if she seems receptive by the end of the date, draw yourself close to her, take a hand or put your arm around her shoulders or waist, look her in the eyes for a few seconds and kiss her.

@summary

 Use elevated language, engage willingly in academic debates if she starts one. If not, better not ask her what opinion is of Celine or Kundera's work, or about the French New Wave. Ask her plenty of questions and listen carefully. When asked, answer amply, not monosyllabic-ally.
 Get near her smoothly and gradually, and occasionally softly touch her hand or shoulder.
 Come across as the perfect gentleman.
, First kiss her lightly on her cheek, ear or eye, before proceeding to kiss her on the mouth. The kiss should last up to 40 seconds.
 As you part, kiss her again, and say how special she is to you. This is a proper love declaration, so be honest but also romantic, full of ardor.
 If you see your date only as a possible sex partner, drop it. Always respect the woman in front of you, and empathize with her all the time. Would you like somebody to be nice, polite and adorable with you just to take you to bed (or get your money, or a position, or anything similar). This is not an article for macho hunters: there are too many of them already.
