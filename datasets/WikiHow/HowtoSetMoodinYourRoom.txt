, The following is a general guide to the influence of colors on mood:


Black: darkness and simplicity
Blue: peace and tranquility
Green: natural yet funky
Orange: warm and with energy
Purple: spirituality, transformation, funkiness
Red: love, danger, or desire
White: purity, simplicity, cleanliness, peace
Yellow: joy, happiness, optimism, hope, sunshine, space

, Choose a color, then paint your room and use as much of that color as possible to create the mood you are looking for. You can also use more than one color or a theme.
 Dark, boxy shaped pieces can give off a foreboding effect. Light, modern pieces, especially glossy, bright colors with less bulky shapes and appearance can have a brightening effect.
 Mini blinds, curtains, or other window treatments can block all, some, or none of the light entering your room. Gauzy or filmy fabrics can filter the light, giving it a colored effect.
, Framed artwork, posters, or photographs can contribute to the effect you seek if you choose them carefully.
 Hard surface floors have a distinctly different effect than carpets, and wood can offer a warm, natural ambiance, especially light colored natural woods.
