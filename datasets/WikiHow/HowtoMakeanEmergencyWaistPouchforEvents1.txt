 You'll need two-thirds for the pouch and about another third for the flap. You'll also need a needle, thread that matches the fabric and a button or snap.
 Start sewing, whether with a machine or by hand, along the edge, making sure you're stitching both sides together. It's okay if it's a little messy, because this will be flipped inside-out later., Now sew the tiny flaps onto the big flap. Before you do this, you might want to cut the flap to any size and shape you want, and then hem it. Make sure you sew the tiny flaps onto the wrong side so they won't show later.,, Then add the strap see Method 3 below for instructions on making the strap, then Method 4 for packing it.
