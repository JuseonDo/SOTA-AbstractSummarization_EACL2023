 If you tell him and he likes you, but then realize you don't It could ruin your all's friendship!;
, If you do something big and flashy he will know something is up. But instead of going with all your friends, just go with him. It'll be fun and you can have some alone time with him.
 If he is not, well, you can change that. I mean you're his friend, right?

,, Short and simple. Just like "(insert his name here), what do you think about me?" And if he says "What do you mean?", tell him, "I think I like you more of a friend. And I was wondering how you feel." .
 If he changes the conversation, do not worry: he knows. Did you think he would just get up and kiss you? He probably is nervous too. And when and if he does, stick with it.
 It may be a bit awkward at first, but if things go back to normal quick then it wasn't meant to be.
 Don't text, he can use this against you.
 If you say no/not for a long time he might feel like you would be uncomfortable so he won't ask you out. If you say yes/just recently he might feel more comfortable asking you out.
