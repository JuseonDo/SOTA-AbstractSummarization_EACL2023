 If you have lost 4 pounds or fewer, then you may want to consider staying in Induction longer.
 If you are still having significant struggles with carbohydrate cravings, then you may want to continue Induction until those cravings are eliminated.
 If you have high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea or a BMI of over 30, then you should consider staying on Induction for more rapid weight loss. Always follow the guidance of your doctor.
 This will provide better nutrition and more variety. However, you should continue to eat less than 20 grams of carbohydrates each day.
 You’ll add 5 daily carbohydrate grams each week until you notice your weight loss slowing. This will let you know how many carbohydrates you can eat while still losing weight.
 Perform cardiovascular exercise and strength training as soon as you leave Induction so that you can lose weight more quickly.
