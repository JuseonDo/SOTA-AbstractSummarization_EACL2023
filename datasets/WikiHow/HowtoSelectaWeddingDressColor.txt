 White, champagne, and ivory-colored dresses are among the most popular. However, there are many other colors to choose from: black, blue, aqua, teal, green, sea green, kelly, bisque, light bisque, pink, dark pink, light pink, orange, yellow, wine red, cherry red, and many more.;
, What is your favorite color? What will the groom like? (Most likely he won't care; he isn't marrying you based on how you look going down the isle.)

, What colors are the flowers? The decorations?

, If you are having a spring wedding, you could make a selection from pastel colors: mint green, lavender, baby pink, or a soft sky blue.
 For example, you may choose jewel colors: dark sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green, and other jewel colors; namely, purple, deep pink, yellow, orange, etc.
, The possibilities are endless!

, If you find a gorgeous wedding dress that is expensive, you might want to try looking for the exact same dress, but cheaper. If you fail at that, than get the dress you found in the first place! No one sees how expensive it is. The same goes for inexpensive dresses. If you find a pretty one, but worry people will think it's cheap, don't! No one should care on how much money that dress cost.
 If you don't find a better dress and someone buys the dress you like, then you are kind of screwed.
