 Place a bucket underneath the pipes to catch any water that may drain out.
 The trap is the curved pipe that dips below the horizontal and vertical pipes.









Try to unscrew PVC pipes by hand.
If you can't unscrew the pipes by hand, then use a pipe wrench to loosen the connections.
 Check the trap for clogs and clean the trap if needed.









If you find the clog in the trap, reattach the trap. Turn on the hot water and see if the sink drains.
If the sink is still clogged, then follow the next steps to use the cable auger.
 Push the end of the cable auger into the stub pipe until the auger meets resistance.
 Tighten the lock screw.
 Push forward at the same time to guide the auger deeper into the pipe.









If the cable catches on something, then turn the handle counterclockwise and pull the auger back.
If the auger meets resistance again, continue pulling the cable out and cranking the handle clockwise until the cable catches on the clog.
 Reattach the horizontal pipe and the trap.
 If the water runs slowly, then use a plunger to dislodge the remains of the clog.
