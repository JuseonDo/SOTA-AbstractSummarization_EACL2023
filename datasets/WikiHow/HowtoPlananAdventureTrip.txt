, Adventure trips are available for families, solo travellers, female travellers and normal groups.
 The adventure holiday agencies have information about how to reach the destination, the logistics etc. Make sure you have all the required information.
 If you are off for a trekking camp in the snow or rafting in chilly waters, or skiing then make sure you have enough warm clothing and protection.
 If your adventure sports require a lot of strenuous walking and climbing then train yourself accordingly.
 So make sure you get maximum information from them.
 Contact them and know about their experiences on first hand.
, Be prepared for uncomfortable situations. You are going for an adventure and donâ€™t expect anything lesser than that. Be receptive to change in weather and locality. See and absorb the changes in culture, people and place. Learn the local dialect if you can. Interact with the friendly locals and know the place better. Let yourself loose and enjoy to the fullest.
 Get the pictures framed and call friends over to share your experiences.
