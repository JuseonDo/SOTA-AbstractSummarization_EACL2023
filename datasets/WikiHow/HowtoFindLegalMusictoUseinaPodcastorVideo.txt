 Every project is different, requiring different kinds of music. Ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with your soundtrack.;
, Include creative commons in your web search. Check out http://creativecommons.org/ and learn more about your rights and responsibilities for using CC content.
 But maybe you just have to use a piece by your favorite band. That brings us to the next step.
 In most cases you do not have the right to pull a song from your favorite CD and use it in your creative work (even if it's just for "personal" use). With the recent increase in strict enforcement of copyright law it's important to make sure your up to date on what you can and can't do. Look at Jamendo.
 There are lots of musicians and composers out there making original music which they can give you the rights to use. Some companies exist just for this purpose; see below.
