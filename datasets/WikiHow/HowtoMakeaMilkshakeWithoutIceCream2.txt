 It needs to be resealable above all else.
 Lightly stir to combine.
 Stir the vanilla in thoroughly.
 It needs to be able to contain a smaller bag and be sealed. A gallon-sized resealable bag is ideal.
 The ice is simply to get the chemical reactions going -- you won't be consuming it. It will remain separate from the milk mixture.
 This has to do with exothermic reactions and is an imperative step to your mixture thickening!

, It requires vigorous shaking for the mixture to thicken. If 7 minutes have passed and it's not thick enough, shake it for a few more.
 Enjoy your shake!
