 Use a journal and write down a few reasons. The art of witchcraft can be used as a tool to manipulate others, although most cases are frowned upon by many modern Witches.;
, They are NOT the same thing. Witchcraft is the magic, while paganism and wicca are religions. Wicca uses magic and Paganism sometimes uses magic, but isn't mainly magic.
 These are excellent introductory books. I also suggest that you look at some books by Basil E. Crouch . Look for "The Darkside Of The Moon A Complete Course In Magic And Witchcraft ." It's a great start to learning more about the art of wiccans, pagans, and witches. Read the bibliographies of these first books to find ideas for further reading.
 Always have counter spells ready when it goes bad and make sure to have banishing spells and purification spells. The best way is to learn how to meditate and learn through your own experience.
 Spells won't usually just happen instantly. The effects may not be exactly what you wanted.
 Talk to other witches, and start up a book of shadows, a kind of book that contains any witchcraft related things, such as correspondence charts and spells. Make up sigils if you have little energy for spells or rituals.
 Tumblr has a large community and is friendly to new witchlings.
