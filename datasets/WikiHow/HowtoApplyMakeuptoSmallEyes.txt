 A strong, well-groomed brow really affects and defines the shape of your eyes.;
, Using concealer and powder is just as effective.
 Choose a color that will bring out your eye color. (Chocolate brown for blue eyes, plum for green eyes, black or blue for brown eyes, and pinkish-purple shades for hazel eyes)

, You want to get as close to the lash line as possible. When you reach the outer corner of your lid, fan the line out slightly passed where it ends.
 white power on the inner corners of your lids, on the brow bone, and right below the outer corners of your eyes. This attracts light to your eyes and makes them stand out more.
 Then with the mascara wand, start at the base of your eyelashes and wiggle it side to side as you move up to the tips. The trick to avoiding clumpy eyelashes is to apply the second coat before the first coat dries. That way there are no clumps and no flakes.
 Turn the mascara wand to a vertical position and run along bottom lashes that way. A second coat is not recommended, because it will make clumps way more likely to happen.
