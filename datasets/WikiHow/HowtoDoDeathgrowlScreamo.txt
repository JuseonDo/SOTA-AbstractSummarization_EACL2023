 It is a must for you to learn how to breathe through your diaphragm so it'll make you sound right and at the same time minimize the damage done to your vocal chords! Just take a deep breath and naturally direct those air you inhaled into your upper part of your stomach (not your lungs) your diaphragm is located right below your lungs. Just keep practising on that till you get it;
, Well that's only part of the deathgrowl but don't worry! You're close on achieving success! (Attention! Never ever make the sound of growling out with your own voice! That is totally wrong and will damage your vocal chords so just let the air in your diaphragm out slowly till there's a growl)

, Like 'hai' or 'argh' like you're frustrated or depressed over something and you'll notice a growling voice but of course let it out naturally! Don't make out the sigh just try to think of something that frustrates you!

, You'll notice your growl have grown louder and that's a great achievement!

, Sounds cool huh? Well that's your deathgrowl! you'll just have to enhance your skill in making it louder and even higher pitch if you could!
