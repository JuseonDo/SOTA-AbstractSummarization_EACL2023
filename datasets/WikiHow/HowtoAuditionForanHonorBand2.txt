@summary
do not wear your band uniform.

@summary
get your stuff together, and have extras of everything on hand - extra reeds (in a reed holder that you can put in your pocket) if you play a woodwind instrument, whatever else you might need, and a couple spare copies of the prepared piece, if it makes you feel better to have them on hand.

@summary
,

@summary
check your instrument to make sure it's in good working order (though you should have had it professionally looked at already).

@summary
show up at the audition site at least half an hour early, so that you'll have plenty of time to warm up, and you'll be there if the auditions are running ahead of schedule.

@summary
once you've warmed up, get to your room at least 15 minutes early.

@summary
stay calm.
@article
 You don't want anyone to know what school you go to because judges or people might be biased and favor you or disfavor you. Try to make yourself anonymous as possible, so the judge only remembers your number. If the judge is someone you know, pretend you don't know them because if you do actually make the band, then you don't want anyone to think that the judge favored you.
, With all the practicing you've been doing, you probably would've noticed any problems weeks ago, but a last check is a good idea. Grease your corks, oil your valves, or anything else, if needed.
 Get your information, find your room ahead of time, and find the warm up room to run through your audition a few more times.
 This way, you'll know where you're supposed to be, and you'll be there if things are running ahead of schedule. Just sit back and relax until it's your turn.
 You're going to be fine... it's just an audition. Deep breathe, count backwards from 100, or whatever works for you.
