, Do this three times.
 Obviously, this time, its weakness is rev rolling, since Blinky mentioned it. So, when the frog sticks out its steel tongue, avoid the spiky ball at the end of it and rev roll into its mouth. Do this three times to obtain the golden cherry.
 You have collected the first golden fruit and beaten the first boss on Pac-Man World 2!
