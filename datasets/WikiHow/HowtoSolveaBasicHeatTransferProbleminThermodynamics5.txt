rework equation 1 to solve for pf, by dividing by volume.

@article
 Pf is the final equilibrium pressure, V is the total volume of the system after the valve is release, m is the total mass of the system, R is the universal gas constant with a known value, and Tf is the final equilibrium temperature that is given.
