Place chairs on top of tables and move them to the edges of the room. If possible, move everything out of the room into a hallway or another room. Buffers can clean spills and remove some dirt, but large pieces of debris should be picked up before buffing.;

Replace a buffer pad that appears used or soiled. Using a dirty buffer pad can scratch the floor, especially at such high speeds.
Check for defects in the pad such as missing portions of pad fabric or unevenness.



Locate the farthest corner from the entrance of the room you are buffing in order to prevent stepping on the freshly buffed floor as you work. Walking over a floor that has just been buffed might scuff or dent the surface.
Make sure there is a close electric outlet and that your high-speed floor buffer cord is long enough to span the entire room. If it's not, plan your buffing route around the location of the other outlets to prevent having to walk over a buffed portion of floor.

Locate the "on" switch. This button is usually positioned with other control buttons on the arm of the appliance. Consult the owner's manual if you cannot find the controls.
Choose an appropriate setting for the type of floor and type of dirt. Some high-speed floor buffers have multiple settings that allow you to select different rpms.



Move laterally throughout the room starting from the right. Work very slowly and carefully. Change up your direction and begin working from left to right to guarantee even buffing.
Overlap about 1/3 of each row as you continue to buffer. This ensures you don't miss a spot.



Check for rips, large pieces of debris or an excessively grimy pad. Replace the pad as needed.
