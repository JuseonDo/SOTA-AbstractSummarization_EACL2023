 You can do this by hand using a whisk, but an electric mixer (such as a stand mixer or a handheld mixer) would be much faster. You can even use a food processor fitted with whisks.


Shea butter is great for sensitive skin, because it doesn't clog pores. It also contains lots of anti-aging vitamins.
 Apricot seed oil is especially good for sensitive skin because it is non-irritating and soothing. It also feels light and doesn't clog up pores. If you can't find any apricot seed oil, consider any of the following oils:


Avocado
Jojoba
Sweet almond

, Vitamin E oil helps reduce signs of aging, such as wrinkles and lines. It also helps promote skin growth and regeneration. Aloe vera gel is cool and soothing, making it idea for reducing acne and inflammation.
 You will need 3 drops of Clary sage, 5 drops of myrrh, and 5 drops of helichrysum. All three oils have anti-aging benefits and help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lines. If you can't find these oils anywhere, or if you simply don't like them, consider any of the following anti-aging oils:Carrot seed
Frankincense
Geranium
Patchouli
Sandalwood

, Once you have all of the ingredients in your bowl, beat them together with a whisk until all of the oils, butters, and gels are evenly mixed together. Transfer the mixture into a glass jar using a rubber spatula.
 Use it within 6 to 12 months.
