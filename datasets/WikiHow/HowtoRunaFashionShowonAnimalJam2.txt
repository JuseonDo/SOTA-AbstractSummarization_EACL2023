 However, going on Adventures give you more gems, as Return of the Phantoms gives you about 1,250 gems if played on hard mode, so you can get an idea of how much gems you get in adventures.
 You will need many of a certain thing for the animals to stand on, as this will be the walkway for the animals to go down, so make it cheap if you didn't get as many gems! You will also need lots of blue striped couches. The couches will serve as a place for everyone to sit down. Space out the couches around the walkway.
 If wanted, add "Realistic" before "Fashion show", so people know the difference.
 These themes don't have to be realistic, and can be like common fashion show ones, as the themes in Best Dressed are not realistic.
 This means tell the people "Vote on who you think is best!". Keep track of the votes on paper, or something like Microsoft Paint.
 Give them a prize and end the fashion show. You can also give them a selection, as you can also do that in a common fashion show.
