 Place your hands palm facing up in your lap.;
, Take a deep breath in, hold it for a second, then blow it out, completely emptying your lungs. Continue to breathe deeply, paying attention to each breath.
 You are surrounded by a pure clear light. Any noises you may hear will help you to relax as you continue to breathe deeply, slowly and deliberately.
 One by one, starting with your head, begin to relax all your muscles.


Feel your face relax: Relax your brow, your ears, let your chin relax.
With each breath, you become more relaxed.
Relax your neck muscles and your shoulders.
Relax your upper arms, your elbows, your wrists and your hands.
Let your fingers relax, let the warmth of the white light help you to relax.
Relax your upper back and your chest, breathing even more deeply now.
Relax your abdomen. Feel your spine relax, relax your buttocks and your hips; your thighs, your knees.
Relax all the muscles in your legs and your ankles. Relax your feet and finally your toes.
, Fill your lungs with the light and feel it flow through your veins.
, With each breath, as the light spreads throughout your body, you feel lighter. You are relaxed, you are refreshed and you feel revitalized.
