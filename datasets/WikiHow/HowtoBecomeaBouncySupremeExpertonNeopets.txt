, They make it so easy and fast to jump! But only the first 3 jumps will have these trackers. Just go as fast as you can for these jumps.
 Use your imagination to pretend the trackers are there. Also, listen to your gut! Just jump how you think you should. Don't change your mind, unless you fall. Then try another power level and/or angle.
 Follow your tips too, and also follow these ones. Keep playing, and with some practice and time, you'll recognize different jumps that you've lost to before, and you'll get farther and farther!

, But, if the jump is hard, its best to just get across.
