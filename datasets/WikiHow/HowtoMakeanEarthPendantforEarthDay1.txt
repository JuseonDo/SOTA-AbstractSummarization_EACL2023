, Flexible acetate sheets are available at scrapbooking and craft stores. You can also use wax paper.
 Tape the acetate over the top of the printout with masking tape, in order to ensure it will stay as you make your pendant.

Mix the glue and food coloring well with a spoon or toothpick.
 Follow the blue areas on the earth image underneath.
 Make sure your brush strokes are fairly thick, so that it will not be flimsy when you finish the pendant.
 Unbend it so that it is in a triangle form with the apex at the top. Place it inside the glue, allowing it to sink to the bottom.


Allow the glue to dry for 1 to 2 days.
, Place it around your neck to wear the pendant.
