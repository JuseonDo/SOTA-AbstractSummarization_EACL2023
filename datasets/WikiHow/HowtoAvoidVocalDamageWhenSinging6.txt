 Enjoy them, like good saltwater taffy., Trace the shape of a rainbow in the air as you think these phrases, and it may help you sing them expressively. Other phrases look more like a waterslide or a straight line. Learn to think about the shape of your phrase and connect through it, expressing that shape in your impetus and dynamics.
 Then, let your body and face express this naturally by thinking that "story line" underneath your singing. In order to do this, you must often research the poetry for full understanding, and you must be well-prepared with your general song-learning to add this extra layer. Don't be too hasty in breaking the mood at the end of the song, but let it linger while you keep your eyes fixed on the same spot for a moment, as if the frame froze at the end of the movie. This will help the mood you have set to be quite powerful.
