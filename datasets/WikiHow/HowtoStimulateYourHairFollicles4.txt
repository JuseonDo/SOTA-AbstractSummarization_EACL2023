 While it is best to make the juice in small batches so that it does not go bad, it will be helpful to have extra onions on hand for when you need to make the next batch.
 Peel it off using your fingers, or you can cut the onions into chunks, which often helps the skin come off easily.
 You have three options for doing this, based on what kind of kitchen appliances and tools you already own:A juicer: Cut the onion in small chunks and feed them through the juicer.
A blender or food processor: Cut the onion into about four chunks and process the chunks in the blender or food processor. Strain the mixture through a metal strainer or cheesecloth over a bowl so that only the juice remains.
A grater: Cut the onion in half and run each half over the grater. Strain the grated onion through a cheesecloth over a bowl to extract the juice.
 Fresh, pure onion juice is potent and can cause a reaction if you are allergic.Do not proceed with the rest of the steps if you are allergic.
 Adding the massage gives the process extra power to stimulate your hair follicles.
 In order to achieve the best results, the onion juice needs to sit on your scalp for at least a half an hour., Once the time is up, shampoo and condition your hair as usual to remove the onion smell.
 It is recommended to repeat this method three times per week for best results within a couple of months.
