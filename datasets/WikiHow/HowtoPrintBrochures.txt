 If you’re printing the brochures on your own computer, be sure you have enough ink and paper stock. Brochures should be printed on a slightly thick paper stock than regular copy paper.;
,, Set the Quality/Speed option to the “Best” option so that your brochure prints with full ink coverage. The faster the speed, the less ink coverage you’ll have.
 Also check your print layout to make sure you’re printing in Landscape mode.
 Duplexing means printing on both sides of the paper. If you have the option, click on a “Side Flip” duplex.
 Click OK to print one brochure. If you’ve got a desktop inkjet printer, you’ll need to manually turn the paper over to print the back of the brochure. If you’ve got a commercial printer, the Duplexing option you chose should take care of this for you.
 Fold it as needed to make sure the text in the panels are correct (e.g., the back panel text is on the back panel).
 You shouldn’t have to redo steps 3 through 5 unless you close out of the document before you’re done printing.
 Also check with online printers to compare prices with the local printers. Online printers can be cheaper than local printers because they have less overhead, but if you need your brochure in less than 24 hours, you’ll need to have a local printer print them.
 Be sure to ask what kind of file is preferred and/or accepted – QuarkXPress, PDF, JPEG, Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe InDesign,Word etc. Some printers only accept certain file formats.


Instead of emailing, you may have to upload your brochure file. Most printers’ Web sites can accept document uploads in much larger sizes than your email account can email attachments. Ask your printer which option is preferred, and use that option.
