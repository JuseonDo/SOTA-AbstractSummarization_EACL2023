finished.

@article
 Use an oblong seeded watermelon, cut a ¼ inch slice off the bottom to provide a stable base.;
, Carve the top edge into a round scallop or pyramid pattern, keeping the cuts small.
 Use the cookie or biscuit cutter to create the two cake layers. Slice the “icing” from the white part of the rind from the top piece you removed. Place the “cake” to the side.
 Combine with other fruits and place in the refrigerator.
 Make sure to leave some space between the letters. Using the channel knife, trace your carving around the letters very shallowly, just deep enough to scrape off the dark green part of the rind.
 Finish off the cake with candles and fruit, and surround your plate with decorative confetti.
