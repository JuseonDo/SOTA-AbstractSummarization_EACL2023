It is not possible to attach other types of files from your phone, but you can animated GIFs, viral YouTube videos, and memes from Kik’s built-in galleries.;
,, Your phone’s photo and video gallery will appear at the bottom of an icon bar. Use your finger to scroll through the available photos and videos. Only the most recent photos and videos are shown by default.
 If you don’t see your photo in the gallery, tapping “Expand” will display a drop-down menu with a downward-facing arrow to its right. You can tap that arrow to view other folders that contain supported media.
 The photo (or a still image from the video) will appear at the bottom of the chat, waiting to be sent.
 This part is optional, but you can add some text to explain the photo or video if you’d like. Tap “Type a message” and begin typing.
 The photo or video (and the accompanying text, if you typed some) will now send to the person with whom you’re chatting.
