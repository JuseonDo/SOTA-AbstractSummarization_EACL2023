 There are numerous sizes, shapes and types of fishing weights to choose from. Visit your local bait and tackle or hardware store to find your weight.;
, The outside of the package on the weight should let you know what type of fishing it is designed for.
 Make sure your fishing line is strong enough to support a weight, it should be written on the package if it is designed for heavy duty wishing equipment.
 Slide the weight to the desired level of your line. For example, if you're bottom fishing, you will want to leave the weight near the end of the line.
 Hold it securely until you are ready to fasten it to the line.
 Begin this process near the bottom of the rubber band and work your way upward.
 Pull the line tight, securing the weight and the line together. Give the line an extra tug to make sure the weight is secure.
 If you decide to do this leave at least 1/8-inch of line extending from the knot.
