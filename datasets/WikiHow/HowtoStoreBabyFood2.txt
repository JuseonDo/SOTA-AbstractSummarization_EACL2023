 Use warm, soapy water or run them through a dishwasher cycle. You can also submerge the trays in boiling water. Before doing so, however, check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that the trays are dishwasher safe and able to withstand boiling water.
 Fill each cube to the top, but do not allow the food to overflow.
 Make sure the wrap forms a sturdy seal along the edge of the tray to prevent dust or other contaminants from getting into the food.
 The food must be solid enough to maintain its shape outside of the tray.
 Place them inside a large freezer bag or an airtight, freezable container.
 Most glass jars will chip under extreme cold, but some manufacturers produce freezer-safe glass and plastic containers. Leave an inch of air in between the food and the rim to give the baby food room to expand as it freezes.
, Put the most recently frozen food behind the oldest food in the freezer. Store baby food in the freezer for up to three months, but no longer.
 Use the refrigerator to slowly thaw frozen food, but use any baby food you place in the refrigerator within 48 hours. Anything that sits in the refrigerator past that amount of time may start to develop bacteria.
