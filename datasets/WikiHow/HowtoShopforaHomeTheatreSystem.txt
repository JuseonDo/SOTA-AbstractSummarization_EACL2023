 There is no absolute scale as far as speaker quality is concerned, and narrowing down your choices can greatly help.;
, Always try before you buy, and never blindly trust what's on the box.
 Research the brand's support network and its quality of aftersales.
 If you don't listen to loud bass often, it often worth saving the money and adding it to your speaker budget., There exist down-firing, front-firing, bass-reflex, and acoustic-suspension woofers. Choose the right one for your needs.
 The AV receiver is the backbone of the whole system. All other components are connected to the AV receiver.
 The amplifier is not a must have component , but it does increase the quality and loudness of your audio by pushing more power to the speakers. Get an Amplifier if blaring loud music is your thing.
 An HD Projector provides an authentic movie viewing experience at home. You can always swap this out for a TV if you would rather like an all-purpose device and are not in specialism.
 The Blu-Ray player is the final component of your system which allows you to view the latest movies in all their glory. Be warned that the proliferation of Blu-Ray greatly varies from developed to developing countries.
