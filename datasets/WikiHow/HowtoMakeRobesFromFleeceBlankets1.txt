 You can use smaller blankets for children. If you do not have an extra fleece blanket at home, buy a blanket from a craft store and wash it at home.

If your fleece blanket has a decorative edge, you may want to cut around the edges of the blanket in a straight line to make the robe appearance more uniform.;
, Working on a flat surface will also help to make your cuts more even., Make sure the wrong side (inside of the robe) is out. Lay it on the table with the ends, rather than the folded side, facing you.
