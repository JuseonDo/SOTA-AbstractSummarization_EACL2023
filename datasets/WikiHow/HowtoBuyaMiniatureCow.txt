 Be sure you don't have any other things you have to do, and make sure you have the time. Do not buy a miniature cow if you don't have the time to care for it, or you can't for any reason.;
, They need plenty of space to graze and run in, and plenty of space for their fencing and shelter.
 Make sure it a safe place in that area where predators don't go in and your cow can't stray out of.
 Buy them before getting the miniature cow because if you bought the cow first, it may need care before you buy the supplies, but you won't be able to check on it because you need to buy the supplies.
 Fencing will keep out predators and keep your miniature cow from escaping. The fencing you get must be strong so predators or the miniature cow won't break through.
 Shelter is the most important part of all. Shelter will protect the miniature cow from bad weather and predators. It should have stalls and fresh bedding in them so that the cow finds a place to sleep at night. Remember to change it every time it's dirty.
 Miniature cows cost a lot of money, so it is a good idea to save money in order to afford a miniature cow.
