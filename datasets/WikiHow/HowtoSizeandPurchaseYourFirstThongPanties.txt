 If you wear a size medium regular bikini panties or size 6 you still would wear a thong panties of that same size. One small exception some of the fabrics are very stretchy so you could get a size smaller if you like your panties to fit snug.;
,, Go to the better department stores and the Victoria Secret store in the mall. Go to the lingerie/intimate apparel department in that store. Don't be shy ask for some help. Tell the salesperson what you want, thong panties in nylon or cotton in your size. They will be glad to help you.
 Get the prettiest pairs and hopefully you will not have to worry about price. When wearing the thong for the first time you may find it uncomfortable (the thin strap in back). Hang in there, you will soon forget you have them on.
 Get a fresh clean towel and lay the panties down on the towel and roll it up, gently squeezing the towel. Now just hang the thongs somewhere in your closet to finish drying.
