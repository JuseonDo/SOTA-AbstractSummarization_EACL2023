 Brazilian Wandering spiders are large, aggressive nocturnal spiders found in South America. They build no webs, roam at night, and can be found in banana clusters or hiding in a dark environment. Their bites produce localized swelling and pain that radiates toward the torso, and may be accompanied by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypertension, breathing difficulties and, in males, an erection. Anti-venoms exist to help relieve symptoms; deaths are rare.
