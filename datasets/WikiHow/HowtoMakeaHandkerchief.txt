 Check the fabric content to see what kind of maintenance it will require in order to stay looking good. For everyday use, you will probably want something that is washable and requires little ironing.









Rather than purchase fabric, look around in your scraps. This is a great project for using up leftovers or recycling old fabrics. Especially if you are making hankies for everyday use, try old bandannas or pillowcases for the fabric. The advantage is, you will already know how the fabric behaves and holds up.;

Typically, a man's handkerchief is 12x12 inches (about 30cm) square. A woman's is 8x8 (22cm) square, but since you are making your own, you may make it any size you prefer.
Using a sharp pair of scissors, cut the square(s).
