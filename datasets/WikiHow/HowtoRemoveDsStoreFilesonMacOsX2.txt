To translate what you do in Finder to a written path, start by clicking 'Macintosh HD' on your desktop. This will become '/'. Click the next folder. The name will follow the '/' so type another '/' before any more folder names. For example, if the folder you are having issues with is 'Macintosh HD' -> 'Applications', the path to this folder is '/Applications'. If the problem folder was the 'Utilities' folder inside 'Applications', the path would be '/Applications/Utilities'.



 


Type cd /path (example: cd /Applications) then press Return.;
,

Type cd in terminal followed by a space






Find the folder with the issue but DON'T OPEN IT, drag its icon into terminal. Watch it complete the path for you. Press Return.
