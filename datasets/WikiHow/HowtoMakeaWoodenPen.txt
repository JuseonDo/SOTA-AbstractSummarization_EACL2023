@summary
gather together pieces of wood approximately 8 inches / 20.3 cm in length.

@summary
find a piece that you would like to use as your "starter" piece.

@summary
cut your "starter" piece using a band saw.

@summary
cut or find another piece of wood.

@summary
using wood glue, glue the three pieces of wood back together again by sandwiching your new piece between the two cut pieces.

@summary
continue to make random cuts in your block.

@summary
cut the block down to a more "finished" size.

@summary
determine which end will be your "pen" end.

@summary
do not remove the drill bit as now it will be your "poor man's lathe"!,

@summary
remove the bit from the block and use a dremel tool to round the end to accept the pen insert you have chosen.

@summary
admire your handiwork - you will have a most original pen that can never be duplicated!

 Any kind of wood will do.;
, Cut it roughly 1" x 1" x 8" / 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 20.3 cm with a table saw. You are free to choose other dimensions - this is just used as an example.
 Cut the full length in a wiggly line - in other words, not straight!








, Find a piece in another color/type. Cut it approximately 1/16 - 1/8" / 1.5 mm - 3.1 mm thick by the length of your "starter" piece. A popsicle (ice cream) stick is a good example of the maximum thickness you would probably want to use.
 Place in a vise and let sit until the glue dries. Cut block back to square again.
 Do this 6 or 7 times, it's up to you how much. Each time, make sure to cut your block back to square. After you have completed your random cutting you are going to see wooden pieces going every which way!

, The suggested dimensions are 1/2"x 1/2" x 8" / 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm x 20.3 cm.
 Either using a drill press, or by hand drilling in a vise, drill your hole the same distance 1/8" / 3.1 mm for the ink tube. Do not drill from one end to the other!








, (Use a real lathe if you have one.) From here, using varying degrees of sandpaper, sand your block round to the diameter you choose. When you achieve the diameter you are seeking, begin using a more finished grit of paper. A faster RPM drill works best.
 be careful not to break through the edges. Tack glue in place and finish to your liking.
