 Figure out where the poles need to go.;
, To set up the two gadget poles, you could either mallet them down and/or secure them to pegs pulling in opposite directions. You could set the string across higher up or lower down depending on how waterproof you want you tent to be and how easy easy it will be to move in and out of it.


It is better to set up the basha between two trees, as they tend to be more secure than gadget poles.
 Tie the four corners to the string and peg in the four corners. Pull the guy-lines tight. Pull the opposite corners first. Having the guy lines go away from the basha at around 45 degrees is best.
