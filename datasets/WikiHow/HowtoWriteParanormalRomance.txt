,, Everybody has at least one of these things. Now it's a great time to use it. People who are obsessed with reading paranormal romance have a reason why they do it. Some are obsessed with vampires and others even want to be a one (desire). When you are reading this, you probably thought of something. You might be ashamed by this or thinking it isn't interesting for your story. If that's the case, please think again.
 Remember to bend at the knees!

, Get inspired. Reading Paranormal Romance is also something you can learn from; it may help you build ideas.
 Characteristics of a man or women you desire can also be used. The Protagonist can be based on you: Connect what you desire in your real life with the protagonist's (learning) process.
 Especially in paranormal romance, it’s smart and also fun to give a character some quirky characteristics. For example: Putting the light out twice before sleeping or being clumsy when they like someone.
 The number one is probably: A (forbidden, secret or impossible) love between a human and a supernatural being

, What makes your story unique?
