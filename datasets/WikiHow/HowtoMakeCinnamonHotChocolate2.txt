 Add the cinnamon stick. Slowly bring to the boil.
 Be liberal with the quantity.
 Whisk until the chocolate is totally combined through the milk.
 This is optional, only if you like it.
 Again, this is only if you like the flavor. It does add a delicious touch.
 Pour the hot chocolate into a mug.
 Top with whipped cream and/or marshmallows if you like. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon for a finishing touch.


Serve with cookies or scones.
