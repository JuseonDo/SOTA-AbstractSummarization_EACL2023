 Victorians were somewhat obsessed with cleanliness, and a pure white or ivory bathroom creates as clean and crisp an appearance as possible.
 Color would not be completely out of place in a Victorian-themed bathroom, but if you introduce color, you should select pastel shades and use them to accent the roomâ€™s white features.
 The Craftsman style drew inspiration from nature, and as a result, warm shades of green and brown were especially common.
 The Art Deco age brought about an interest in vibrant hues. Select tiling and wall paint in bright, eye-popping shades.
