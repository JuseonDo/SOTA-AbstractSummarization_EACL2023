 Lay them on a single sheet of kitchen paper towel on the microwave dish. If you need more space, you will need to do this in lots.;
,, Although they feel soft when you first remove them, on cooling they will crisp up and be as fresh as new.
 Eat them as usual, with dips, spreads, cheese, or by themselves etc.
