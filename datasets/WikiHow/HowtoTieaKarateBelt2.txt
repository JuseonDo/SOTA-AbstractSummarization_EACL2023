 This method uses the same kind of knot, but has a different way of wrapping it around your body.
 The two sides should be equal.
 You will need to switch hands behind your back. Make sure that the belt overlaps itself. Hold the belt where the two ends cross again in front of you.
 Keep the belt at the center and make sure this part of the knot is snug.
 Pull the knot tight and make sure everything is even and centered.
