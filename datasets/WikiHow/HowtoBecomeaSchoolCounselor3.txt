 It's often not how good you are that gets jobs in many cases--it's whom you know and being in the right place at the right time. Contact your professors and people with whom you worked at your practicum and internship to ask about employment opportunities.
, Some international schools provide students with diplomas based on USA curriculum and the ASCA National Model/standards, and these schools employ school counselors to counsel students.
 School counselor positions are usually listed with other education-related positions on sites advertising jobs at schools. Competition for school counselor jobs can be stiff in major metropolitan areas, so do a thorough search and make sure you put your best foot forward at every interview or consider moving to a rural area where job competition is not as strong.
