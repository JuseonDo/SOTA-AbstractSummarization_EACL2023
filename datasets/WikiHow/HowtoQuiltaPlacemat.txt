 To make a 12" square placemat you will need:

In the red fabric: One 4.1/2" square, four 2.3/4" squares and ten 2.1/2" squares.
In the white fabric you will need: Four 3.3/4" squares and fourteen 2.1/2" squares.
For backing fabric and wadding you will need: A 13" square of each and for binding you will need a strip 55" long by 2.1/2".;
, Sew a seam 1/4" either side of the marked line and cut along the marked line. The two resulting triangles will open up to make 2 squares, each made up of a red triangle and a white triangle.,

Trim the triangle points.
Sew one pair of squares to one side of the 4.1/2" square and another to the opposite side of the square. Be careful to sew the squares so that the white triangle is away from the red square.


That's the star part of the patchwork placemat complete. It is actually known as the evening star quilt block.
 Add a strip of four squares to the top and bottom of the star block, then sew a strip of squares to each side of the star block., Pin and then sew the three layers together. Consider quilting along the edges of the star; while you don't have to, doing this gives a pretty pattern on the back of the placemat.,
