 Either use a pre-made cake board or place plastic wrap over cardboard as a base for your cake.;
, Alternate each cookie layer with a whipped cream layer.


Note: You can opt to remove the creamy filling in the Oreo cookies before making this cake. If this is done, mix the removed Oreo filling with whipped cream, then add this between the layers instead.
 Spread the sides with whipped cream, to cover and hide the inner cookies and cream.
 Place it in the freezer to freeze it for four to six hours.
, Finally it's done; take it out and enjoy! Slice it as for any cake.
