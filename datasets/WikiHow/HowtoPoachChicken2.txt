 Look for plastic wrap that can withstand some heat. If a box of plastic wrap says it can be used in a microwave, you’re good to go. It just needs to be able to heat since it will be placed in boiling water., If you buy lean chicken, this will most likely not be necessary. Cut the chicken lengthwise.
 Stir it thoroughly so that the salt and herbs are evenly spread around the bowl. Add the chicken breast pieces to the bowl. Make sure that they are coated evenly in the lemon juice mixture. Let the pieces sit in the mixture for several minutes.,, It should be at least twice as long as the chicken breast pieces. Remove the chicken from the lemon juice mixture and place it in the middle of the plastic wrap sheet.
 As you roll it, compress as much air out of the plastic wrap and chicken as possible. You want the plastic to be as tightly wrapped around the chicken as possible so that the chicken poaches properly., Roll the wrapped chicken along a flat surface (like a cutting board) just like you would roll a rolling pin. This will wrap the plastic evenly more tightly around the chicken., Repeat this wrapping process with the other chicken breast.
 Do not take the pot off of the hot burner. Drop the plastic-wrapped chicken pieces into the water. Be careful not to splash yourself with the very hot water., Let the chicken steep in the water for 15 minutes. If you are using very large chicken breast pieces, or are using defrosted chicken that had not defrosted all the way, you may want to let it steep for several minutes more., To remove the chicken from the plastic, hold the chicken over a bowl using oven mitts.
 There are tasty juices inside the plastic wrap so make sure to hold the chicken well over the bowl in order to catch those juices., You can pour the saved juices on top of the chicken to add extra flavor.
