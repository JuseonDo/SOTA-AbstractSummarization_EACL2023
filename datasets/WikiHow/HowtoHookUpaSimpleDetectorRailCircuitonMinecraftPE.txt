 This is your Redstone signal item.;
, A rail road that is three blocks long is a good starting choice.
 Three wires is enough, but make it longer if needed.
 Maybe a piston to push a block somewhere, or perhaps a lamp to turn on.
 It should be before the detector rail on the track.


Make sure the detector rail is not the first on on the track.
 When it rolls over the detector rail, the Redstone receiver will perform it's duty for a limited amount of time.
