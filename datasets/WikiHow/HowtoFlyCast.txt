 While in the other forms of casting, you're casting a bait or lure, in fly casting, you cast the line in a manner similar to cracking a whip with a weighted tip.;
, You should hold the rod straight in front of you as you do this, reel down, with your thumb resting along the top of the rod handle.
 This is about 30 degrees above horizontal, or the "10 o'clock" position.
 You should do this quickly enough so the line's weight and movement bend the rod. Stop the backstroke when your thumb points straight up.


To make the line move faster, pull downward on it above the reel with your other hand as you lift the rod tip.
 At first, you may want to look behind you to watch the line straighten out, but you can eventually feel a slight tug as the line straightens.
 This will make the rod move faster, giving your forward stroke more power.


You can again make the line move faster by pulling downward on it with your other hand.
 Your thumbnail should be even with your eye at this point; the snap should be sharp enough that you can feel the rod tip whip forward.
