move; as soon as the horn/whistle blows get to cover.

@summary
spread your team out, don’t concentrate your entire team in one section of the course, it makes it far too easy for an opponent to move around your flank and take down half of your team.

@summary
move in pairs if possible.

@summary
it is vital that you keep moving, being covered and covering your teammates (shooting down range (at the enemy’s position) when they move).

@summary

@summary
move down the sides of the course if possible, this gives you a better angle of fire on the enemy to thin their numbers before the eventual run for the flag.

@summary
pin down the opposition (fire at them so intensely that they won’t wish to break cover) when moving for the flag.

@summary
moving back to your base with the flag can be done multiple ways.

@summary
detail a course of action to be taken in the event that the opposing team reaches the flag before you do.

finding yourself cornered, launch yourself quickly and unexpectedly from cover to cover, firing as you go.

 Don’t waste your time trying to spray down range on your way, just get to cover as soon as possible.;
,, That is, travel in a group of two so one person can cover the other while they move from location to location. This is one of the most effective strategies for a game of this nature. It affords a certain adaptability from a pre-game plan that is vital in effecting a decisive victory.
,, Have as many of your teammates as possible do so. It’s a huge advantage if the opposing team is unaware of who has the flag and where that person is once it has been removed.
 If there are only a few opponents left then a flat out run towards the base is advisable (zigzagging the entire way). If there is a strong opposing force left then this would be impossible and one’s movements must be covered by teammates. The flag could even be handed to a teammate to throw off the opposition.
 Needless to say this will require you and your teammates to be more brazen in your movements. If it’s a small course a center third of your team should fire on the enemy positions while the other two thirds charge down the flanks. If it’s a large course then it’s likely that a team member located on the flanks of the field can snipe the runner if they make a break for it.
 Better the loss of half of your team than the loss of the game.
 Chances are the opposition will be too shocked to react immediately. There’s still a chance you can win the game by eliminating the other team.
 When playing 2v2 or 3v3, make sure one person is always covering the extreme sides of the course. If you get flanked, you are done for.
