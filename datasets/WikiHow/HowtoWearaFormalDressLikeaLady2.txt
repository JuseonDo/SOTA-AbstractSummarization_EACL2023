 Sitting on the whole seat is not ladylike and makes accidental exposure easier.
,, You must cross your legs at the knee because simply keeping them together may not be enough, depending on your dress' length.


As you cross, keep your legs close to each other so that you do not show anything under your dress. Keep your legs crossed while you are seated.
 Do this in addition to crossing your legs, if you are wearing a short dress.
 Keep them close to each other, and stand up slowly.
