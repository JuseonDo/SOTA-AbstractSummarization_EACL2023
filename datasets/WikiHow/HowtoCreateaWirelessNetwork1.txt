 To create wireless network you need a wireless router or wireless access point.


If you have broadband connection with DSL modem simply connect the WAN port of new wireless router to the LAN port of wireless router.
To configure new wireless router connect the network cable with your PC and new wireless router.;
, Usually it is 192.168.0.1. However, each router's companies IP addresses differ, so look at your owners manual for complete specifications. Enter the user name and password (default user name is “admin” and default password is also “admin”).
 Go to WAN Settings and chose the DHCP mode.
 Do this if you have same IP address with DSL modem. For example, if your DSL modem IP address is 192.168.0.1, change the wireless router IP address to 192.168.1.1 and give the default subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
 Give IP addresses a start range and an end range.
 Change the default primary SSID and broadcast SSID to secure the wireless router. Choose the security mode and WPA algorithm, and enter the key to the router.
 Change the WPA Algorithms settings to TKIP&AES. You can also configure the wireless key.


Secure your wireless network by following the security recommendations from the instructions while setting up your router.  You may choose to leave your wireless network unsecure, but then people may be able to see the information you're transmitting or even access your network without your knowledge.
  If you left the network unsecure, you won't need a password.
