 The pumpkin needs to be firm, unblemished and able to sit well without rocking.


If needed, slice the base very thinly to make it sit straight. If this can be avoided though, it's best left alone.;
,, Use a strong spoon or a proper pumpkin scoop to do this. The flesh can be kept to make soup, etc.


Leave a layer of flesh around the edge of the pumpkin. This creates a waterproof layer.
 You can add a doily to the plate first if wished.
 Add the flowers. Try to choose flowers with orange and yellow colors, to keep the pumpkin or squash theme going.
 Rearrange the flowers to make them perfect, if needed.
 There is no need for washing any awkwardly shaped vase. All done!
