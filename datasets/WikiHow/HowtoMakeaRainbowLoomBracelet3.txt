, Do the same on all of the bottom pegs.

Take the bottom colored band and pull it up to the peg directly above it.
 Do the same thing on all of the rows above the first one until you reach the end if the loom.
, Reach your hook down through all of the bands on the last middle peg.Grab a new band that you hold in your fingers, pull it up through the bands, and then slide your hook through the loop of the new band, so that it's completely wrapped around the hook.


Then, holding the hook in your hand with the loop still around it, pull the whole bracelet off of the loom.
 Add new bands onto the loom, around 8-10 of them all down one side.


Loop the the band from the first peg onto the second peg, then the second peg onto the third, third onto the fourth, and so on. Then, take the first loop on the end of your bracelet (on the side without the hook) and treat it like another rubber band, adding it to the chain you've started on the loom. Next, chain the bands from the end with the bracelet all the way down to the first band.
 Add a C or S clip to the last band on the loom, take the whole thing off of the loom, and then clip onto the loops on your hook.
