, The hotter the water, the more effective it will be in stripping detergent build up and dirt.


Be sure to turn it back to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) or lower to avoid burns when you are finished.
 Do not add detergent.


If you have very hard water, try adding a commercial water softener to the load for extra efficacy.
 If possible, select the option for an extra rinse. Make sure it is set to agitate the load or wash it for heavy soil.


Check your wash during the rinse setting to see if you have any bubbles. If so, then detergent build up is probably your main problem that needs to be stripped from the diapers.
 Dry your diapers after the last cycle and assess their smell and texture.


Consider buying a special cloth diaper detergent, instead of using your commercial detergent, since it is more likely to wash out.
If you continue to use regular commercial detergent, use less than the amount indicated to avoid detergent build up in the future.
