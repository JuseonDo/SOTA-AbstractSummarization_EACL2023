 If this is the case, and you have checked for garbage disposal clogs, the cause may be the flywheel.


Leaking from the bottom of the disposal may also be a problem with the flywheel. In this case the flywheel seal needs to be replaced. Follow the instructions in the method above to replace it.
Do not test your garbage disposal for longer than 10 seconds, if the wheels aren't turning. A caught flywheel can burn out the motor in the disposal.
 Make sure power is completely off.
 Use your hex wrench to loosen the flywheel at the bottom of the disposal.
,,,, This can help to avoid future clogs, if food debris was the cause of your problem.
 If it says that blades cannot be sharpened, or if you cannot find the cause of the problem, you may need to send for a new flywheel assembly.
