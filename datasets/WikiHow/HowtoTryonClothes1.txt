 This will make it easier to take the clothes. Now you can just grab the clothes and try them instead of pulling them out of the closet.;
, If something is too big or too loose, see if it is adjustable. If it isn't, you got three choices. Give your younger brother or sister new hand-me-downs, donate to charity, or just throw them out.
 Do the same things you did with the pants except you don't need to check for if it's adjustable. Most shirts don't have that feature.
 Maybe headbands. If they hurt your head, get rid of them. If they keep falling off, get rid of them too. You also should check if they make you look crazy, just in case.
 You all know what we mean. Bras, underwear, that kind of stuff. Again, if they don't fit, just get rid of them. Don't worry about the way they look. No one's going to see them.
 This is so whenever you need to get something, you will always see something good in your closet.
 This is so it won't get in your way later. Swimsuits would be classified as out of season if school is in season. You won't be going to the beach if school's tomorrow, wold you?
