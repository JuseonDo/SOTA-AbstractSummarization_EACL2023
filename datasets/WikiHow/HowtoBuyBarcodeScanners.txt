 If it's ONLY UPC codes or product codes a single line laser scanner, linear imager, or contact scanner would work. If you will be scanning mobile coupons off cell phones you will need an imager that has "screen read" capabilities. If you will be scanning QR codes or PDF417 driver's license barcodes you will need a 2D imager barcode scanner.;
,, Laser scanners are accurate but do not work outside. 2D imager scanners allow you to scan barcodes from any angle making them great for fast pace checkout. Imagers with no moving parts tend to be more durable then laser scanners. Industrial scanners are made to be in harsh environments where they may be dropped or operate in very cold or very hot temperatures

,  Most USB cables are around 6 feet (1.8 m) and the scan range of a standard scanner is two to 24 inches (61.0 cm).  If you need more range then that consider a bluetooth wireless version of the scanner.
  If you want to be hands free then a scanner with an auto-sensing stand or auto sensing mode is recommended.
  Scanners may need to be configured to work with your software, it is best to purchase a barcode scanner from a web store that has a tech support department.
