This procedure should be done by two people who are familiar with the procedure and comfortable working with an iguana.;
, The leg that you will inject should remain uncovered. (The towel helps shield you from the lizards claws, gives you an easier grip to gently hold the lizard still, and by covering the iguana’s head and eyes helps the lizard stay calm.
 For this example, the medication is injected into the muscle on the front leg. All medications must be injected in the front third of the lizard’s body and most antibiotics are shot into muscle. However, you must always check with the vet for each medication.
, Trying to insert into a scale will bend most needles. Make sure the needle has gone into the muscle then inject the medication.
