 Regardless of what your coach or parent may say, you'll feel much safer if you're up a bit earlier than you should be.;
, Bring a bottle of water or fruit juice. Energy drinks work too.
 Breathe in and out evenly, and think "I'm breathing in the sunlight and energy, and I'm breathing out the bad energy and the pressure" and you'll be okay.
 Too much tension in your muscles will slow you down in your race.
 Visualize your race, perfectly done like it's over.
 Concentrate on your own race.
 They mean you're ready, but they can be a bit scary.
 Take your mark when you are told. Do not move after that, or you will be disqualified. Then go!

, Do what you've been doing before. Remember, what you do in practice transfers in a meet, so strive for excellence while swimming.
 Maybe it's not a bad time, but hey, you did it! You'll improve if you didn't do a good time, but congratulate yourself for the good effort. You'll be glad if you did.
