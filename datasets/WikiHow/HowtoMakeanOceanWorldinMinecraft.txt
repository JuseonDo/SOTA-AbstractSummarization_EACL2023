 Single Player is a place in Minecraft where you can be all alone and play in three different game-modes: Survival, Hardcore, and Creative.;
, This will bring up a screen allowing you to change the options of your new world before creating it.
 Then click it; After clicking this button, an advanced options screen will pop-up. From there: Click World Type: Default and until it says World Type: Superflat.



After clicking Customize, a screen named Superflat Customization will appear. From this screen, you can see what your world will turn out looking like. Of course, it starts off as the basic Minecraft layout for a Flat world: 1 layer of Grass, 2 layers of Dirt, and 1 layer of Bedrock.






If you don't want to use the basic layout, you can create your own.
, You will see a list of layouts you can use for your Minecraft world (or, you can create your own if you don't want to use them). Instead, we shall create our own! There is already a layout named Water World, but that tends to be very glitchy and there are craters in the water! (If you decide that you would like to use it anyway, then there is no need to read and further).
 This is where you can type in the code for the Layout. Clear this box, and enter your own code for better results. Now Copy & Paste this code into the box: 2;7,100x9;1;biome_1,village


It should now say what is shown in the picture (if it doesn't, don't worry; you can just edit it again or copy and paste the code again).
 Then press Done

, This may take about 30 - 60 seconds to generate, so be patient.
