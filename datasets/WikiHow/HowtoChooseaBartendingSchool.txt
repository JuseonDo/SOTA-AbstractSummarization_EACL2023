 You'll need to learn to interact well with customers, including learning standard conflict resolution skills. A bartending school should include this in its training.;
, The standards of bartending have been turned up a notch. On top of the classic drinks, today’s bartenders need to be up on the modern drinks that are served in the trendy bars and clubs. There are more liquor brands, more flavors, and more high-end spirits on the market today than ever before.


A bartender needs to know more about wine knowledge and service nowadays – customers are more wine savvy.
 Cash registers are out, and the modern POS (point of sales) registers are in. The course you choose must include proper training on how to use this technology efficiently and well.
 Speed, efficiency, and the ability to multitask is more of a requirement of the bartender than it ever has been before.
 Sit in on a class and see what is being discussed. Check out the instruction manual (for example, no one is drinking ‘Pink Squirrels’ and ‘Grasshoppers’ anymore, so if these sorts of drinks are in there, it's dated). Talk to the instructors and students and see what sort of vibe you get.
 That way, you can talk to graduates that have completed the entire course – at the end of the course.
 Take your time, do your research and always compare the facilities and training of several schools before you make a final decision.
 What things do former students say about the school? What sorts of work have former students being able to find after doing the course?

, Is the course something you're willing to outlay money for and do you have confidence that you'll recoup that money quickly afterward? Find out about refunds should you start the course but decide it just isn't for you; it happens.
