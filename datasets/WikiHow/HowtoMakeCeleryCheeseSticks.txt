 Thoroughly wash the stalks to eliminate any dirt. Cut each stalk into 4" lengths. Depending on the length of the stalk, you might get 2-4 pieces out of it.;
, The amount of bowls will determine on how many different colors you want. Decide on whether you want to do rainbow colors, holiday themed colors, or just one color for everything.
 If you want a darker color, add an additional drop. Mix the colors and cream cheese together thoroughly.
 Snip a small corner from the bottom of the bag.
