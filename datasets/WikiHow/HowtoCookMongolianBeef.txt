, Make sure to add ingredients in the order they are listed.
 Then, let the meat marinate, undisturbed for thirty or forty minutes.
 While the beef is marinating, add the ingredients, in the order listed, to a small mixing bowl. Stir each as it is add so that each ingredient is incorporated well. Set the sauce mixture aside.
 As the meat continues to marinate, wash the green onions and pat dry with paper towels, then cut them on diagonal into 1 inch (2.5Â cm) pieces. Strip the skin off your garlic and mince it.
 Once sufficiently cleansed, drain, then pat dry with paper towels.
 Once the oil comes to a temperature just below the smoke point, add the marinated beef and fry until it is cooked thoroughly. Drain the beef on paper towels and pour out the excess oil.
 Wait for the oil to come to temperature, then place the minced garlic into the pan. Stir-fry the garlic for a short time, then add the corn and onions into the pan and continue stir-frying.
 Lightly push the vegetables outwards. Pour in the sauce and bring to a slow boil, continually stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens.
 Then, bring the beef, vegetables, and sauce together.
