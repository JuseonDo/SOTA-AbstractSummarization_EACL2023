 Generic or name brand it doesn't matter. Witch Hazel is not that expensive and can be found in almost any store. It is an astringent.;
,, There will be a slight stinging for a few seconds, but after you remove the cotton ball the sore will no longer be painful. Repeat about 3 times a day (ex: morning noon and night)

, The more often you use this method when an outbreak occurs the less frequent outbreaks happen.
