 You need to be able to use surf in order to find Waterfall. Surf is a move that allows you to ride the back of a Pokémon over water tiles in the game, letting your explore the oceans. To get Surf in Pokémon Black by:


Getting your Jet Badge, won by defeating the gym leader in Mistralton City.
Defeating your rival, Cheren, at the entrance to Twist Mountain.
Talking to Alder at Twist Mountain, who will then give you HM Surf.;
, Waterfall is on a series of cliffs across the ocean from Route 1. Head over with a Pokémon who knows Surf., It is on the southern end of the Route, near your starting town and a patch of wild grass.
 You'll reach land again, where there are two trainers and some wild grass. Follow the road to the south-west (down and left) until you hit a tunnel., You'll reach another ocean. Use surf to hop in again.
 You'll run into some trainers and some Pokémon on the way, but nothing insanely difficult. Eventually, you'll reach a large landmass with giant staircases. Head up them to continue your journey.
 On the farthest left portion of the area is a high bluff, only 1-square across, covered in high grass. HM Waterfall is at the southernmost tip of it.
