 Fold a sheet of paper in half. Sketch out half of a butterfly and then cut it out. This will make your template which you will be basing the rest of your butterflies on. It will make your garland more consistent.Make the butterfly no more than 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) tall.
You should only draw and cut the wings; don't worry about the body. You will be making it out of pipe cleaner later.
 Make sure that the folded part of the tissue paper is nestled against the folded part of the butterfly. You will be cutting the tissue paper one color at a time, then arranging and assembling the colors later on.
 Take the cut tissue paper butterflies out of the template and unfold them. Set them down in a neat pile, and move on to the next color. You will need three different colors.
 Cut the pipe cleaners in half using a pair of pliers or wire cutters. Bend each cut pipe cleaner in half. You will get two butterflies out of one pipe cleaner. Cut and fold as many as you need.
 To save time, make all of your stacks now, so that they will be all ready for you. You can stack the colors in the same order, or alternate them. You can also make some butterflies all one color.
 Scrunch the middle of the butterfly slightly, then slide it into the bent pipe cleaner. Measure up about half way up the pipe cleaner, and twist it twice. This closes the body.If you don't wish to use these butterflies on a garden, you are finished. Gently spread the antenna apart, and curl each end for that final touch.
 This will give your butterflies are more fluttery appearance. Be careful so that you don't pull the wings out of the pipe cleaner body.
 Measure out your twine, and slide it between the butterfly's antenna. Twist the antenna one to two more times, then spread them apart in a V-shape. If you'd like, you can curl the ends of the antenna at this point., When you are done, hang the garland wherever you like, such as across a doorway or window.
