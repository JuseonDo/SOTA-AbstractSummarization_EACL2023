 Pancakes, waffles, french toast, and crepes would all be an excellent start to your celebration. (See related links) If you don't feel like cooking, take some real maple syrup with you to your locally owned pancake house.;
, Make a peanut butter sandwich, only add maple syrup instead of jelly.
 Try it for the sweetener in your favorite recipe for muffins, baked beans or barbecue sauce, too. If you're replacing crystalline sugar, reduce the other liquid a bit.
 Try topping ice cream with it, making a layer of syrup in cakes, and dipping Twinkies or other light cakes in it.
, Very delicious.
