 It may help you to come to faith. He lives in our hearts by faith. When you come to the point of trusting Him enough to ask Him for your salvation, He will live in your heart, also.;
, That is how one becomes Born Again in Christ the Lord.
 You also have the option to read the Bible at home yourself, however, it is far better to be taught by someone who is knowledgeable in Sacred scripture. Jesus said, "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you." John 14:16-17) And,"However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.John 16:13

, In most Bibles in their 'help' section you will find a list of fulfilled prophesies.
 Type into your search program names such as Fenelon, Molinos, and Guyon to name a few.
 This will help you articulate your own faith in God and begin to form your own statement of faith as you form your beliefs.
 You will find it becomes a two way conversation as you also wait upon Him to speak back to you... with a thought or perhaps a verse that comes to your mind. He wants to commune with you just as much as you want to know Him. He also wants you to call upon Him when you have need! Psalm 50:15 "And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." And you have the promise that He will answer you! Psalm 91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
 But know also that,in sincerity, you may at anytime and anywhere, enter His Presence and worship Him.
