 If you need the phone number, you'll potentially need the phone number for the company that can be found online or from other airline documentation.

Most airline flight miles portions of these airlines aren't set up to handle these transactions, but can give you the phone number to the company when asked.
 You can pretty much judge an approximate time of arrival., Most will be more than happy to explain approximately where the incoming plane is at that current time - but be careful as some won't give you too much of an update and if you are incessant they won't give you any update at all so be careful. While some airlines just tell their agents to relay their departure and arrival cities, some can look on their computer and see approximately where it is, and will tell you.

Be careful if they ask for additional payment to find out additional information about the flight.
 Some uncontrolled airports (those that don't have official control towers) have details that tell you which planes are nearby that can give you a clue to where these planes are and their estimated time of a arrival (ETA).
