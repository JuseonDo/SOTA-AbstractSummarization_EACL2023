 When you click this button, it will provide you with a first name and surname.
  These have been in for the past few years, and therefore strong choices.  Aidan, Dylan, Caden, Camden, Galen, Logan, Owen, Ethan, Quinton, and Evan are all appealing choices on that front.
  These tend to be associated, by some, with grown men. However, you could put a modern spin on these names. Examples are Ed/Eddie, Charlie, or Jamie.
  This works especially well if the name was an occupational name.  For instance, Tanner, Draper, Fletcher, Archer, Hunter, Porter, Parker, Fletcher, Thatcher or Tucker are strong choices.
  Examples are Cody, Colton, Lane, Wyatt, Butch and Casey.
  Caleb, Noah, Joshua, Jacob, Isaiah, Elijah, Daniel, Methuselah and Josiah are good examples.
 Kristian, Kurt and Kaleb are some good.
 Alternatively you can look up names online.
 Call the male toddler Egbert, Zafroid, Thyygd, HummingBird, MoonUnit, Apple, Zippy or Bungle. Be inspired by TV or movies, try Herman, Ulysses, Hannibal, Templeton, Indiana or Romeo.
