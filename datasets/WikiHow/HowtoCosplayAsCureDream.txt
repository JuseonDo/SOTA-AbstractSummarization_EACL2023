 Decide on the alter ego of Nozomi Yumehara and how you wanted to cosplay as her in her Cure form. This might work if you turned 14 years old since eighth grade, but you might think your appearance is refreshing and beautiful. Other Pretty Cure cosplay may work.;
, Bid $300 if you want to be like the Nozomi Yumehara. Also a higher amount of money can help you cosplaying as Cure Dream. You can bid the money via an auction, or pay just $70 to have your offers.
 This may be similar to that of Cure Black or Cure Rouge, but lighter. Definitely it may be better than Cure Bloom, or Cure White, respectively.
 Buying could cause you earning for above $300 for the anime fee. No matter that you wear this to anime conventions or weddings.
 You can search via EBay, Amazon, H&M, or other cosplay retailer. Just keep on having to wear that costume via receiving $600 cosplay deal. You can do it all that you want. If your money is way low to $85, you can't buy it, with a cost of $70 per week.
 That means if you have $85 in your wallets, your autograph can be improved since the costume you previously bought, but especially Cure Dream cosplay, seriously.
, This may be used until needed or to transform into Pretty Cure.
 Go to a hair salon and day spa around the town or one nearest you. Then buy a pink and swirl the open ends with the loops to make it more like Cure Dream. A salon expert pays you a dividend for another $600 and the cosplay tracker will be accepted.
, You might as well keep introducing yourself as Sailor Moon, or so.
 It never matters knowing that you cosplayed as Cure Dream before the turn of 2011.
