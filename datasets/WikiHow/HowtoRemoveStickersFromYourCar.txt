 Dip a wash rag into the soapy water, and wash over the sticker several times. Make sure to wash the area surrounding the sticker as well. This action will soften the sticker.;
, Be liberal with the application. This will help to break down the glue on the back of the sticker. Wait 5 minutes or more before proceeding to the next step. This allows the tar removal substance to soak through the sticker.
 This step to lift the sticker is the first true attempt in how to remove stickers from your car.
 Slowly slip the plastic spatula further under the sticker until you have removed the largest portion of the sticker that you can. Use your other hand to guide the spatula carefully underneath the sticker. Remove as much of the sticker as possible.
 Do this thoroughly. Try again to wipe off what is left behind using the plastic spatula.
 Continue to scrub the area with your soapy rag until every last bit of the sticker is removed, leaving nothing on your motor vehicle.
