 Make sure it's one that nobody will be suspicious about. If you're outside of school, go with something small. But during school a backpack will work great.;
, Important tools include pen, binoculars, a notebook, and a digital camera. Include clothing for disguises, a hat, a scarf, some sunglasses that cover much of your face. Possibly you could put a snack and some water in there.
 You can do larger missions if you have more people, about two to six kids. Make sure your spy team is composed of your closest friends, only kids who you can trust. You don't want a tell-tale! Appoint a leader (the Head Agent), and listen to her and to your team members.
 Make up a secret identity for each of you, so if you do get caught, you aren't totally busted. Memorize your code names and practice using them., Learn how to talk in Pig Latin or some other language. Practice your language, and keep using those code names., Know where all the secret walkways and hiding places are. Establish a secret hideout on your playground. This should be large enough to fit you and your team and provide a good secret area in which to stash supplies.
 Learn skills like sneaking around after school

,,,,,, That way, you can record what you saw or heard.
