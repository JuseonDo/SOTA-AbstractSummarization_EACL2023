 Identify a place in your yard that will accommodate the screen and your guests. If you plan to project the film onto a screen or white sheet that you hang on the side of the house, take that placement into consideration.;

 It can get buggy at night so you should have bug spray handy as well as lit citronella candles placed around the perimeter of your “theater.”
