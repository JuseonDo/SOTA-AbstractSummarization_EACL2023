 When the milk starts to boil, you immediately take it off the cooking plate.
 Let it rest for a couple of minutes. When the chocolate looks like it has melted, whip it lightly until it gets thick.
 Use a frosting spatula to make it as smooth as possible. Put it into the freezer for at least one hour.
