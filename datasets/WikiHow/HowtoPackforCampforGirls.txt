 They will be happy to supply you one, and even if they cannot provide you a list they can answer any questions you have. Most of the time a detailed list will be provided by the camp during registration. Many camps do not allow you to bring outside food because it can attract animals, so if you want to take some snacks, confirm that it is allowed first.;
, Clothes are the number one thing you will need because you will be participating in a lot of rigorous and often dirty activities. Everyone at camp usually needs to change outfits at least once per day. There is no substitute for a duffel bag full of clothes.


Be sure to pack your hygienic supplies, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, a hairbrush, deodorant (very important!), a bottle of shampoo, a shaving razor, and any other things you might need. If you believe you will have your period during the trip, be sure to pack some large boxes of tampons, pads, and even a few extra pairs of heavy-duty underwear.






Bring anything else you might need: a water bottle, bug spray, a flashlight, sunglasses, sunscreen, . Chances are, you will be hiking, swimming (if there is a lake), and doing other outdoor activities, so be prepared for anything and everything.
 You don't want to buy another bottle of sunscreen when you have three bottles lying around at home!

, If you find that you do not have all of the items, go and get what you need as soon as possible. It's better to be prepared early but there will always be things that you have to stuff in your bags at the last minute.
 You may very likely need several bags or boxes to hold everything, but try to keep it all organized.
