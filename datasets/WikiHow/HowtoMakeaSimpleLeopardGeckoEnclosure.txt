 The tank must be at least 10 gallons, but a 20 gallon would be better. One with sliding doors would make taming easier. Use caution if putting on the floor as the under tank heater may burn it.;
, DON'T PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE. Leopard geckos need an UTH to control their temperature and digest their food easily.
 Don't use any kind of sand, if your gecko swallows it, it will become impacted, which will kill your gecko. Instead use reptile carpet, paper towels. Slate or natural stone tile holds heat better for belly warmth.
 Then you will have one hide for the hot side, and one for the cold side.
 And fill the inside with damp paper towels.
 These help them rub their skin off when they shed.
 Fill one with pure calcium only, and the other with water.
, Horn worms, silk worms, butter worms and phoenix worms are high in calcium, so they don't need to be dusted, but only give these to your reptile once a week. Only give wax worms once in a while as a treat since they are high in fat content.
