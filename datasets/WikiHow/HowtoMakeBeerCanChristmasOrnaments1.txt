 Use as many cans as you wish to make ornaments. Depending on the size of the ornaments, you should get around 2-3 ornaments per can.;
, Use graph paper and sketch out the holiday shapes to be used for ornaments. If you're stuck for ideas, plenty of templates can be downloaded from online sites for you to trace around. The main thing is to keep it really simple. Cut out the designs on paper or card. Typical ornament designs include: Angel; snowman; star; Santa; reindeer; stocking.


Example: You've chosen an angel. The template can be as simple as a circle for her head and a triangle for her body, with two triangles for wings. Your children can draw it for you.
 Watch your fingers, as cut aluminum is sharp. If you want to remove splintered edges or sharp bits, it is possible to sand the edges but be careful while doing this. Wearing heavy duty, pliable gloves is advisable when cutting and sanding. Then flatten the can to allow for the designs to be cut out.
 Then cut around the design using the tin snips and a sharp pair of scissors for the more tricky parts.


If you have additional parts, these can be glued on, especially where it's too tricky to cut out the whole design but a lot easier to cut out basic shapes and glue them into formation. Heavy duty super glue will work best to bond the pieces.
 Thread some string or ribbon through and tie a knot to create a hanger.
 If it looks great, make some more.
