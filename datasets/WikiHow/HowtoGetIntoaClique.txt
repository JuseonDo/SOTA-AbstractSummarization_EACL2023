 If you want to be accepted you need to fit in because people like other people who are like them.You must carefully study their ways, manners of behavior and mentalities. After acquiring this knowledge, imitate them. Slowly assimilate into their "clique culture".
, Work on your humor. In addition, funny comebacks are very popular with people. Although it is making fun of innocent people, it makes well-known people laugh with you and want to like you.
 Some groups might be very sarcastic, while others are very serious. Study their language, too. If they use many slang words, start talking like that. If they speak very properly or use many txt words, work on talking like that!

, This will show you how their mind works.
 If you are their friend, then they can get you in the clique. Nevertheless, try to be friends with one of the smaller people first off. Do not get ahead of yourself.
 Try to find something you both have in common. Study everything about her, but avoid becoming obsessed

, It is a great conversation topic, and you may even know one of them personally.
 That way you will know more than one person inside that clique, and the rest of that clique will judge you less or in a positive way.
 Sometimes they will think you are weird and/or stalking them. Be careful that you do not hang out with them too much in the first few weeks.
 If you are in some classes with them offer to help them with stuff. Just do not imply they are stupid! They could get very insulted by that.
 Remember to have fun, and do not turn into somebody you are not.
