 Look at many different resources: the internet, books, friends, teachers, co-workers, etc. Become somewhat knowledgeable with where you will be travelling to. Find information about typical behaviors, dress, lingo, etc. of the culture you plan to visit.;
,
Where can I find (shop, restaurant, etc.)?
Hello, Goodbye, and Thank You.
 This will help with how you should pack. When the time gets closer to your date of travel, check current weather forecasts (which can be found online) so you pack accordingly.
 A 3-ring binder is very helpful. Include copies of your flight information and boarding passes (if applicable), what hotels you will stay at, places to eat in the area, where you will be visiting, different tours of the area, etc. The more organized your information, the easier and calmer your trip will be, instead of scrambling for information.
 Drive around and locate shopping malls, restaurants, and interesting tourist spots. If you are staying in a hotel, walk around and locate elevators and stairs, concierge, the pool, and other interesting areas.
 Go to both tourist-y areas, and areas where the locals go. Take a sight-seeing tour with a tour group, visit museums, go to shopping centers where the locals go, eat where the locals enjoy their food. Of course, it is okay to visit tourist-y destinations as well.
 Eat a new meal you have never tried. Do an activity you have never done, but always wanted to do. Be daring, but also be safe. If you are not sure what something is, ask. Don't be afraid to try something, because you just may like it. And if you don't? Well, at least you tried it!

, If you don't like something, do not be insulting, such as saying "that's not how we do it in (your own culture or country), so you guys are doing it wrong." Think of how you would like to be treated if a foreigner came to your own country for the first time.
 Take multiple pictures of your journeys to keep as memories.
