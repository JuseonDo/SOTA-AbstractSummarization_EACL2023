 You don't want to pull a muscle, or injure yourself.


Touch your toes
Do a straddle
Stretch out your back (try a bridge).;
, When doing a handstand, be sure that you are on a mat, or the grass. Ensure that there is nothing close by that you could fall into if you collapse or that your legs will hit when you come back down.


Having a spotter (someone to help keep an eye on you and maybe even hold your legs upright) can be helpful.
, Choose which foot you are going to kick up from.
 Your body should feel as if you're reaching up to the sky, to achieve a lovely straight pose.
 Don't try to keep your hands too close to your feet, as this will make the handstand much more difficult to perform.
 As you put your hands down, lift up the foot that you are not planning to kick off from. Lifting up the foot in front will give you the momentum to stay up.
 Raise your legs into the air.
 Once you are vertical, squeeze your feet and legs together and tighten your abs. To stay up in a handstand, you need to keep your head in, toes pointed, back and stomach pulled in, and make a hollow body.
 When you are ready, step back down, keeping your arms by your ears, and finish.
 Look at you now!


Before you do a one-handed handstand, make sure you have mastered a regular handstand.
