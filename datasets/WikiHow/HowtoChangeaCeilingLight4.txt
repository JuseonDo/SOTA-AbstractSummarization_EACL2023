 Check for any damage. Note how the ceiling wires attach, and how much bare wire you need to make a good connection.
 You may need to expose more bare wire, or perhaps create new bare wire ends if the existing ones are brittle or partly broken. Follow the same process in reverse, following the instructions. Work carefully, and take your time.
 Your light should come on since the light switch is already turned to the 'on' position. If it doesn't, see the tips below.
