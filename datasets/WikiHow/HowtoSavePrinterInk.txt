 Ecofont shoots holes into your font. It can help you save up to 20% ink compared to standard fonts.;
, If you find one once you've hit print then you'll have wasted all that ink and have to print again.
 Unless you're printing something where quality is required.
 It will track your savings in ink and paper.
 Black ink cartridges are usually much cheaper than the colours.
 At this point you may decide to manually change the settings, for example print several pages on one piece of paper, reduce the size of an image etc.
 The likelihood is that your printer will park the ink cartridges and cap them so that they do not dry out.
 This wastes ink.
 Chances are you have 10-30% lifetime left. So keep printing until the printer stops. Remember to buy a new cartridge for when the cartridges do run out.
