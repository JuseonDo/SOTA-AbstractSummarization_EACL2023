The top of the step that you place your foot on when walking is called the rise.
Place a measuring tape at the deepest portion of the step. This will be the area where the rise adjoins the fall of the step above it.
Pull the measuring tape to the very tip of the rise and check the measurement.;
,


The fall is the portion of the stair that connects the rise of 2 adjoining steps.
Position the tape measure at the edge of the rise and pull it down to the bottom of the fall of the stair where it adjoins the step below it.lol

,


Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) to the total to account for waste, padding and carpet cutting.
,,, This will be the total length of carpeting that the stairs require.



Put the tape measure at one end of the rise and stretch it across to the other end.
There is no need to measure additional steps as long as you know the measurement of the widest step.
