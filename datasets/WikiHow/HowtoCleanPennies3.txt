@summary
get a can or bottle of coca cola.

@summary
set the pennies in a dish so they are not sitting on top of each other.

@summary
put just enough coca-cola in the dish to cover the pennies.

@summary
let sit for about 4-5 hours.

@summary
take the pennies out and wash them off with warm or hot water.

@article

 The acid in the Coca-Cola needs to work into each penny directly.
 More is not necessary, so grab a straw!
