 Dot it on over any blemishes or under-eye circles and blend with your fingertips or a makeup sponge. If your concealer tends to cake, apply eye cream first.;
, Apply it in dots over the central part of your face, then blend it out with a makeup sponge or your fingertips until it covers your entire face.
 Use pressed powder to touch up when you're away from home.
 Use powdered eyebrow shadow on brows instead of pencil, which can often look unnatural. Apply it with a hard, slanted brush.
 Use the dark only to line your upper eyelid, in a fairly thin line along the upper lashes. Use the medium shade for the crease and the lightest shade for the area under the eyebrow. There are many variations on eye shadow application techniques.
 Use a cake eyeliner with a damp, thin liner brush, or an eyeliner pencil, and line the lower lid below the lashes. Line only the outer two-thirds of the lower lid, or all the way across if you're trying to achieve a darker look. Line all the way across the upper lid (just above the lash line and as close to the lashes as possible), or start the line where your lashes begin.
 Choose brown mascara if your coloring is fair; black or brown-black works well for darker coloring or try colored mascara such as navy or plum for fun, but don't go too bright if you want to be taken seriously.
 If you have to blend in blush, it's too bright.
 You can mix colors and textures to suit your moods and your outfits

, That way you won't end up with a dark circle of lip liner after your lipstick has worn off. Avoid combining very dark lip liner and pale lipstick.
 You should be. Go out and have fun!
