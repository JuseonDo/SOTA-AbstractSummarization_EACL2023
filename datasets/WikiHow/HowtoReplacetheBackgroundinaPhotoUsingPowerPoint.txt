 You now have a PNG file of your image with no background.
 If you want to make a collage you may repeat the above steps as many times as desired with each image to include in your collage.


Hint: Use a separate PowerPoint file for each image. It will be much easier to work with just one image per file.
 Load all of your images into a new PowerPoint file with the background you desire along with your new background photo (or you may simply use a blue, green, black or other desired color as your background). You may also add WordArt to your photo for Captions, etc.
, Once you have a photo you like, you may print it or save it as a .jpg photo. JPG photos may be uploaded to Facebook, emailed, printed at your local pharmacy, etc.
