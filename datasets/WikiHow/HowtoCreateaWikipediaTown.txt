 This is not something that can be done in a day, week, or even months.;
, You will want to get the town councils (in whatever form they are), businesses, chamber of commerce, citizens, etc. For this to be successful, it will need to be a community project.


Towns have meetings (town hall meetings, council meetings, etc). Attend them and bring up what you have in mind. Point out the benefits of this project.
Don't just get some Wikipedia editors and call it good. Get some principal members of the town involved. This will bring others in, which will bring in even more people.



You will want to come up with a way of displaying the codes so that they are easily accessed. Some ways of doing that are:

Making sturdy ceramic or metal plaques (for codes that are exposed to the elements)
Smaller plastic, ceramic, or metal plaques for non-town specific labeling.
Labels (Use inside of buildings for displays)
Glass stickers or decals in the windows of stores and shops to provide information on the location.
 This is the first (and only at this time) city that has been 'created' so far. Learn from their experience.
 Some of those are Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, etc.
 You want involvement with those that are knowledgeable in life and the history of their town.
, Model it after the MonmouthpediA page.
 Get the word out and let others know about it. This will increase interest in your project and in the town. A win/win situation for everyone.
