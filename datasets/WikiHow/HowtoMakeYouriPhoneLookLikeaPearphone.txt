 The PearPhone looks like the iPhone 4! So you have to have one!;
, Pick ANY color such as red, green, blue, purple, orange, pink etc.
 I know on Victorious its black and blue but the black looks nice like it is.
 Make it the "Tri-tone" cause that's the default on your iPhone.
 Some ringtones are "Strum" "Crickets" and "Sonar"
