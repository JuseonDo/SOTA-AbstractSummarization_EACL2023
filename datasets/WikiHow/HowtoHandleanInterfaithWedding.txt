 Have a deep and clear perception that you two have different religious beliefs and now, as you decide to come together, both will have to accept and respect each otherâ€™s religion. You have to be firm and positive about your relationship. Only then you can convince others of its survival.;
, This will give them adequate time to get acquainted with each other and talk candidly about the wedding ceremony and rituals.
 You can accomplish this by assigning two officiates to do the ritual. The ceremony would be performed in both religions and would certainly please the respective communities. This step would assure your fiance(e) and his or her family that you respect their religion and beliefs.
 Both sides can view the performance of rituals and point out any shortcomings or discuss disagreement on any traditions.
 Discuss the invitations with your fiance(e) beforehand.
 Music is the essence of the mood and celebration at weddings. If you can prepare a fusion performance for the event, it would really surprise your family and guests.
, Have two officiants to represent each of your faiths.
, Have two separate ceremonies.
 Have your wedding performed by the Justice of the Peace.
