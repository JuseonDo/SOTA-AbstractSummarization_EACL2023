 It is better that they find it out from you before they find it out from somebody else, or else they will think you've been hiding it from them. Just don't walk home all mopey, then shove it in their face, that will make them really angry.;
, For example, if the teacher gave an unfair test that half of the class failed, tell them that.
, Ask for their opinions & suggestions, since parents always have helpful ideas/experiences.
 Don't fake it, as that won't help and some parents find it irritating.
 Ask for help in the specific areas where you are facing difficulty.
 List down specifically how you plan to tackle the subject. Always keep a planner and write down your homework assignments and update it daily. You can also put a small white board in your locker and write your assignments there to remember what you will take home.
 It is up to you to study for the next test, go after-school for extra help, or put more effort into your schoolwork. Almost all teachers want all of their students to succeed and will gladly help you if you put in the effort and time.
 If they do this, tell them you would like them to lower their voice and have an adult conversation, and tell them how this cannot happen if they are screaming.
 Having them do that will show them that you really are doing your best to pull your grade up. It will also give them (and you) an opportunity to catch mistakes and make the assignment even better.
, Fights never end well.
, Everyone has something awesome to do but try not to play games or listen to music. Punish yourself and take your games and phone from yourself and try doing your assignments. Please be aware of this. And be sure that your parents know that you have tried your best
