 This is a requirement unless you have mods installed in your game allowing same sex couples to have children together. The two Sims you have chosen also must have their relationship level high in the "love" category.
 You can't do any actions until they start talking to each other in bed.


Instead of a bed, you can also use hot tubs, cars, elevators, photo booths, clothing changing rooms and supposedly other things. However, you must have the correct expansion packs for different places.
 Then you have to kiss, then make out. They do not have to kiss or make out, but chances can sometimes increase if you do this.
 If the option is not there, you may need to get their lifetime relationship number higher.
 This will tell you that your Sim is pregnant.

,, This may take a while, so you must be patient.
, Save and go back into the neighborhood, then open up the cheat box (using ctrl-shift-c) and type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true and then return to your house. Then, select the sim you want abducted and shift-click on the telescope, then select 'be abducted'.
