Cut drywall to size with a sharp utility knife and a straightedge. Smoothen the edges of the drywall with coarse sandpaper and a sanding block.
Utilize homemade 2-by-4 T-braces to assist yourself and a partner when installing the drywall. Rent a cradle lift for assistance if you are installing the drywall panels yourself.
Nail the drywall into place, leaving 6-inch (15 cm) intervals between the nails. Dimple the drywall by giving the nail an extra hit to break the surface material.;
, Let the compound dry for about 24 hours, then apply a second and third coat.
, Apply joint compound and sandpaper.
 Tray ceilings are made by adding a lower rim to the ceiling, rather than removing material from the center. The width of this rim is typically 1 or 2 feet (0.30 or 0.61Â m) (30 to 61 cm), depending on the dimensions of the room.
 The shape of the lowered area on a tray ceiling often mimics the shape of the surrounding walls, although you can use a more intricate design. Use a chalk snap line to mark this outline.
 Secure the furring with glue and nails.
, Wait as long as the manufacturer of your joint compound recommends.
 The bead runs around the perimeter of the outline at an angle.


Snap chalk to outline where the edge of the vinyl meets the upper level of ceiling.
Apply adhesive caulk to secure the bead in place.
Staple the vinyl bead where it meets the lowered section.
Attach the longer vinyl beads first.
,,, Painting the lowered section of ceiling a few shades darker than the upper ceiling can enhance the contrast between levels.
