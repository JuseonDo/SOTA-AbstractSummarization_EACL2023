 You can find the Settings app in your Apps list.
 If you don't have a Motion menu, you can calibrate your sensors using a special code or with a third-party app instead.,, If you don't see this option, check the Display menu from Settings.,,, Don't move the device during the calibration. This will just take a few seconds, and you'll see a "Calibrated" message appear once it's done.
