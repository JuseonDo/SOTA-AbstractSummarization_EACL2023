 You don't want a terribly long monologue if you're just a beginner. Also seek a topic that you enjoy; it will help the memorization process.


Match your monologue to your skill level; if you are a beginner actor, start with a fairly short monologue.;
, Trying to memorize word by word is harder and more difficult, but if you memorize the story you can improvise if you forget some of it, and also it will give it more emotion.


If you think of it as telling a story, each thing happens for a reason, cause and effect, it will help you to remember what comes next.
 One long cramming period is generally not effective.
 Write each section on a note card. Memorize one notecard per day until you've learned the lot.
 Listen to it as much as possible, speaking along with it.
 Concentrate on your face, body language, expression and the clearness of your voice.
 If you're cramming and don't have much time to memorize or break down, the key rule is to not freak out. Have a sip of water, take a deep breath, and relax. Start with the first phrase read it while looking at the paper then close your eyes and say it. Then read that phrase over again with the next one, and then close your eyes and repeat both phrases. Repeat, repeat, repeat.
 Do whatever you can to try to make memorizing your monologue fun. If you're bored, you risk giving up on it.
 Read and compare it to the actual monologue.
 Have them prompt you with the next word if you get stuck. Mark the spot where you froze, and go over it later.
, If the people you're performing for never have seen the monologue before they won't understand what's going on. Also don't go too slow, it'll bore the audience.
