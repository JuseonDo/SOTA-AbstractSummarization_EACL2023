 The box has to be smaller than 40 inches. Cut away all the carton on the bottom of the box. Put the box outside.
 Tie the branch somewhere not higher than 50 inches. At the other end of the branch, tie the branch onto something else. Then, in the middle of the branch, tie a rope that is three inches long.
 Put the string through one of the holes.
 Do this by putting your hand inside in the box, put the string in the other hole from inside the box. Make sure you place the box in an isolated area. Take your hand out of the box and pull the string you got out from inside the box and tie the string to the other string with 3 knots.
 Connect the thread with the string and make two holes in the top of the box.
, The carrot has to be 3 or 4 inches high. When the rabbit jumps up and pulls the carrot down with its paws, the thin sewing thread will break and the box will fall over the rabbit.
