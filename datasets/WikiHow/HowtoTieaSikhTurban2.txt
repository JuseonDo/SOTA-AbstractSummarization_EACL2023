 Holding one end in your mouth allows you to have both hands free while you wrap the turban.
 Pull it back around to the front, going around the knot. Let it go lower around the front of your head on one side.
 This time, go higher on the other side of your head as you loop around. Pull it down lower on the other side.
 Layer it as you go. In fact, you can create a stair-step effect on the front of your head as you wrap it around.
 When you come to the end of your turban cloth, tuck it in to the top folds of the turban. Be sure to pull it tight so it stays in place.
 Pull the end around the back, and tuck it under the back folds of the fabric.
