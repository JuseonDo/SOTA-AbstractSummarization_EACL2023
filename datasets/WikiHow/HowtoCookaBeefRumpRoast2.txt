 Take care not to remove too much fat; just the tough or thick parts.
 Adjust the temperature setting on the appliance to low.


Most slow cookers and crock pots come with a guide to let you know how long it will take to cook meat at various temperatures. Use the guide to figure out what setting to use.
 Pour a cup of water over the seasonings.
 It should take six to eight hours, depending on the setting you choose on your appliance.
