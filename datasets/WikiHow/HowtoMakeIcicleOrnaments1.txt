 Fill a large pot with 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water. Place it on the stove, and let it come to a boil over medium to medium-high heat., Keep stirring until the Borax dissolves. This can take a few minutes., If you are making several ornaments, you can pour the water into several smaller jars. Keep in mind that your icicles will be a little shorter than the jar, so don't go too small.
 These will eventually become your icicles, so you can make them as long or as short as you want them to be. They need to be short enough so that the ends are at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom of the jar when you stick them in.The color of the pipe cleaners may still show through. For best results, use white pipe cleaners. Light blue or silver may also look nice, however.
 Cut as many pieces of string as there are pipe cleaners. Next, tie the ends of each string together to make loops. These will allow you to hang your ornaments. You can use any type of string you want; a good option would be clear thread or fishing line, however.
 Slip the end of a pipe cleaner through a loop, then fold it over so that it hooks onto the loop. Do this for all of the pipe cleaners and loops.
 Place the pencil over the mouth of the jar so that it doesn't fall in. If the pipe cleaner is still too long, take it out of the water and trim down the end; alternatively, you can untie the loop, then retie it shorter. The pipe cleaner needs to be at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom of the jar.If you don't have a pencil, you can use other items, such as a spoon, skewer, chopstick, pen, paintbrush, or popsicle stick.
You can put more than one pipe cleaner into a jar, but don't let them touch each other or the walls of the jar.
The fewer pipe cleaners you put into a jar, the more crystals will form.
 Anywhere between 8 and 12 hours should be sufficient., Be careful with these icicles, as they are very fragile!
