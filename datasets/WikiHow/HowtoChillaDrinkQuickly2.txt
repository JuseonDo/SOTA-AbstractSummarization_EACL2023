 If your drink is small, you may only need to use half a paper towel; if your drink is larger, a full one or even two.
 Try to make sure the paper towel stays wrapped around the drink.
, The paper towel will be partially frozen; keep it on your beverage if you want it to continue cooling down the drink. If you are using the drink in presentation, remove the wet paper towel before serving.
