, The character recognition process is automatically initiated by the OCR software as the pages of the PDF document are scanned.
 For the data to be presented in rows and columns so that it can be correctly recognized, you have to select the table format within the program.
 After the completion of the recognition process, save the file in Excel (.xls) format. The converted data will have to be verified and formatted manually.
 Delete any unwanted columns.
