 There are many different lip scrubs that you could look up, but here is an easy, non-expensive way to get rid of chapped lips.
 This particular one consists of honey and sugar.
 Then, it will start to get a gritty type of texture and consistency.
 Get some on your finger tips or a cotton ball, and message it into your lips. The sugar will work to scrub off the dry chapped layer on top, and the honey will leave it smooth and shiny afterwards.
