 There are many different ways to apologize.;
, Why are you angry at them? (make sure to know this specifically).
 So get ready to start writing!

, (See 'tips' to help you decide.)Sometimes If They let you know over text or a social networking site it is best to apologise but then wait and maybe see them until you tell the full story.
 Get your computer, or a pen, and some notebook or printer paper. (see below to help you decide what pen to use.)

, Sometimes, it is easier to just get to the point and apologize before you write "Dear ___." Leaving 2 spaces gives you room to do that after you have written your letter.
 Tell them why you did what you did, but don't put too much blame on them. Apologize to them, and let them know that you regret it. Let Your Friends know you'll do anything to make amends but don't seem too eager.
 Don't get too offensive or mean, but say something like 'It really hurt my feelings when you did/said ...'

, You can say something like 'They say that the threads of friendship can never break, and I think that's true,' if you want. Mainly, just write that you hope they accept your apology and that you hope you can work things out. Write sorry again, then sign off by simply saying 'Your Friend (Hopefully), ...' or something like that.
