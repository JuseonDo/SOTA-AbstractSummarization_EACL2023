@summary
take a good amount of paper (20-30 pages, or more, depends how thick you want your journal to be) and cut them in half.

@summary
find something to use as a cover.

@summary
decorate your cover.

@summary
cut a strip of ribbon that is long enough to hold all the paper together.

@summary
thread the strips of ribbon though the holes punched in the paper.

@summary
tie it off with a flourish, and now you have your own personal journal.
@article
 Hole punch the left side of the paper (where you want your journal to be bound.) There should be three to five holes, more if you want the binding to hold together better, though the more holes you have, the more ribbon you’ll need.;
, Some thick construction or scrapbooking paper should work.
 You could paint a picture, trace your hand, paste stickers or photos on it, make doodles, write a poem, or anything you feel like. Be creative! (Or you could use paper that already has a design.)

, If you’d like, you can use several different ribbons to make it more colorful.
 This is the most important step because how well you secure the ribbon depends on if your journal will fall apart or not. Make sure the paper is secure in the ribbons.
 You can write or doodle in it, do whatever you want!
