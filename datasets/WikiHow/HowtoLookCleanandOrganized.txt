 The loofah will help to spread the soap around and lather it up well, while cleaning your skin better than your hands would. When searching for body wash, try one that smells like vanilla or citrus, as both of these will keep you feeling fresh!;

NOTE: if you want to look clean and natural then don't apply loads of hair junk, and don't go for TOO much volume.
 Make-up turns off most guys and make your look dirtier. Be sure you know how to apply your makeup properly.
 Use mouthwash, if you want. If you're going to school or work bring mint gum to chew after lunch. Don't chew gum all day long though, most people find it gross when someone does that. Also don't replace brushing and flossing with gum, only use it when you're out and about.
, You'd be surprised how nice a pair of dark jeans can look with a tee-shirt.
 This will not only finish off the look, but drinking water will help you stay feeling fresh and clean.
 this will make people think that you're in total control, and you will be!

, A two-inch stub of a pencil and ripped up notebook will not make you feel fresh and clean. They don't have to be brightly coloured, nor do they have to be all blacks and greys. Get whatever ones you like just take care of them and replace them when they become too worn out.
