 Find a basket in a size that wonâ€™t interfere with traffic patterns but one that is easily accessed from the loo.
 This method may hold up to three or possibly four rolls (depending on the size) at once. Keep near the toilet or behind the tank.
 The top of a box of DVDs or CDs is the perfect size to hold a reserve roll of T.P. House it on the floor or the tank for quick access.
 Simply tip the hat upside down and place rolls inside. If possible, go for a larger hat for better storage.
