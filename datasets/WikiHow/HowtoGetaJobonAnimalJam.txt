 If someone answers, "If you want a job, go to my den". Head to their den!;
, They will tell you everything you need to know to complete the tasks.
 If no one answers and it's been a long time, get a job at the Aquarium or Smoothie Hut, Hot Cocoa Hut, or Pillow Room.


At the Aquarium, pretend to give tours.
At the Smoothie Hut or Hot Cocoa Hut, pretend to give people drinks.
At the Pillow Room, tell everyone, "Fill out this form to adopt someone".
