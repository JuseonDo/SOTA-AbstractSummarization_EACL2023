 Don't force it on; it’s fine if the ring sits above the knuckle at this point. Use a marker to mark the underside of the ring along the center.
 You can either use dedicated wire cutters, or pliers with a cutting edge. Set them along the line you drew on the ring. Apply pressure smoothly to ensure an even cut.
 Bend both sides of the ring to keep it as even as possible.
 Ideally, you’ll want to use a metalworking file. Alternatively, you can use a nail file, but it’ll take longer to file down the ends. You want to make sure the ends are flat so they won’t be able to scratch you.


You can use a nail buffer to smooth the edges after filing them down.
 The ring should fit comfortably but not move on your finger and the open edges shouldn't dig into your finger when you move it.


If the ring is still too tight, remove it and widen it further with pliers.
