 Grease the pan. Then line both the base and sides with the parchment or baking paper.
 Add the butter and sugar.
 Heat and stir for 3 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves.
 Stir constantly for 1- to 15 minutes until the mixture thickens. When it turns a caramel color and leaves the sides of the saucepan, it is ready. Remove from the heat.
 Stir to melt it through, stirring until the mixture turns smooth.
 Set aside to cool and set.
 Place in the refrigerator to firm up for an hour.
 Tip the fudge over, using the paper.
 The fudge can be wrapped in wax paper or clear cellophane, or served immediately.


If you don't wish to wrap individual squares or fingers, keep in an airtight container lined with wax paper. Use wax paper if you need to layer it.
