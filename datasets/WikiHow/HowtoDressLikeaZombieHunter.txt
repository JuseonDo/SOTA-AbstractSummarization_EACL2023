 You can choose to wear regular clothes or military surplus. Either way, you need to make a simple decision: color. The most recommended is grey, black, tan, olive drab, camouflage, or hunter orange.;
, Get a tight-fitting t-shirt, preferably Under-Armour. Wear a jacket over it, preferably leather.
