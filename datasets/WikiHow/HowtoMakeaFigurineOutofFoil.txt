 Gather all the supplies you'll need, and make sure you have somewhere to work where you can make a bit of a mess.;
, Break the phosphorus tips of the matchsticks and glue them together like a skeleton. This would need approximately 6 sticks at most.
 Let the glue dry.
 You'll need smaller strips so that you can mould them around the skeleton easily.
 Create layers to add more volume.
 Fix the thermocol/polystyrene ball at the 'neck' of your figurine and cover it with foil, too.
, Cut the blotting paper into strips and wrap them around the body until it is completely covered.
, It may seem like a crazy idea but it works.
 Make sure all the glue is dry first. Consider using tribal colours for a neat effect!

, Your little man is ready.
