 There are several types of waterproof sprays available, so choose one that is designed for clothes that are not waterproof.Most of these sprays are made with a base of silicon or fluoropolymer., It is best to apply the spray in a room. Factors like wind can make it hard to control the spray if you are working outside.
 Do this to avoid making sturdy stains on the clothing when you apply the spray.
 This way, you can see how it will affect the fabric. If it does not cause a lot of discoloration, continue to spray the entire inner surface of the clothing.
 Hold the spray 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) from the clothing and try to spray it evenly.
