 The most crucial step in the deep conditioning process is choosing the right product for your hair type.

Make sure you read the label. If the product is a rinse out conditioner that coats the hair shaft without penetrating it, the directions will say to leave the product on for 2-5 minutes and rinse.



 


If the product is a true deep conditioner, the directions will state to leave the product on for 15-20 minutes. The product, especially for women of color, should be extra moisturizing. Natural-based products penetrate the hair shaft which will keep your hair healthier for a longer period of time. Natural ingredients are always better.

,, Apply your deep conditioner to dry hair. Ultra moisturizing deep conditioners work wonders on hair. Apply a plastic cap, apply a turbie twist (or hair wrap to secure in place) and go to bed. The next morning, shampoo this product out. While you were sleeping, the heat from your scalp and body produced natural heat underneath the plastic cap. Itâ€™s a great way to save time and not spending your precious moments of free time underneath a noisy dryer.
 Try doing this for about 15-20 minutes.
