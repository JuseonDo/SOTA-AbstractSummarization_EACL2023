, Trying to race, especially without studded tires will most likely lead to a crash.
 Pedaling too hard will make the rear wheel slip.
, Ice with a small layer of snow provides much more grip than clean ice. Ride on the side of the road if possible

, Dangle your foot over the side and use the front brake sparingly. Keep in mind that rim brakes are prone to building up ice which will significantly reduce available braking power.
 1 hour of real experience is worth more than 100 hours of theory.
