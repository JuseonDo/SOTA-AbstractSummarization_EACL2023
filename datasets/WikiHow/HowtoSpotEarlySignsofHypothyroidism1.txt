 Because the thyroid is directly related to your metabolism, hypothyroidism correlates to a slower metabolism which can lead to a feeling of fatigue and sluggishness.;
, If you have been gaining weight lately for a seemingly unexplainable reason, it is possible that this is related to hypothyroidism.
 When your metabolism is slowed (as it is in hypothyroidism), you cannot generate the same internal heat to keep yourself warm.
 If you are noticing any of these things, especially in conjunction with other more common signs, and symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain, book an appointment with your doctor to have your thyroid tested.
 For others, it can lead to unusual snoring and/or fitful sleeps with awakenings during the night (as sometimes hypothyroidism can lead to concurrent sleep apnea).
 If you are having bowel movements fewer than three times per week (over a period of at least three weeks), or significantly less than your normal, consult your physician. This may or may not be related to hypothyroidism; either way, it is something that is beneficial to speak up about as your doctor can help you to manage this problem.
 If you are finding it harder than normal to catch your breath walking or working out at the gym, it may be a sign of thyroid abnormalities. (If it is not hypothyroidism, unexplained shortness of breath is still a concern that should be evaluated by your physician.)

, Signs that occur less frequently (but may still be indicative of hypothyroidism) include:


Mild swelling around the eyes
Menstrual irregularities in women
Mild high blood pressure (this will require a doctor's evaluation)
Elevated cholesterol (this will require a doctor's evaluation)
Memory lossCognitive dysfunction (memory, concentration)
Hoarse voice
Leg swelling
Slow heart rate
