 It's a sad truth for many, and some people do cry over this fact. Especially if you've had a lot of fun over the course of your stay, be prepared for a lot of strong emotions.
 Write them down somewhere you can hold onto them and keep track of them.
 Make sure you have everything that you brought with you in your suitcase, and if you can't find something, attempt to track it down before you leave.


Make sure you have a change of clothes, some pajamas, toiletries, and proper shoes, not to mention your bedclothes, left out for the final night, especially if they are gathering your luggage the night before.
 So you made a fantastic new friend, shot a perfect bulls-eye doing archery, or trotted on horseback for the first time? Great! Think about that. So you messed up what was going to be a perfect friendship bracelet but you still had fun anyway? That's great too! Reflect on your best (and occasionally worst but still fun) moments.

Do not, what ever you do, think about how much you'll miss being at camp. You will feel absolutely awful and you will have trouble falling asleep.
 Talk and be kind to everyone. The more friends you have then the better time you will have. Even if you dont have many friends still be positive and open-minded. Always follow the rules so you don't get in trouble. Nobody wants to be friends with someone who might get them in trouble.
