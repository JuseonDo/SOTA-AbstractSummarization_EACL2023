 A fairy ring is a ring of mushrooms growing in grass. They're usually easy to spot, but sometimes the mushroom caps are not visible. In these cases, the fairy ring will appear as a ring of dark green grass. In some cases, the ring will appear as a circle of dead grass., Get a trowel, shovel, or screwdriver, and prove the soil around the mushrooms. You may notice some white, fibrous stuff in the soil. This is known as the fungal mat. Depending on how thick it is, you will need to employ different methods of eradicating the ring.
 Start aerating 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) outside the outer rim of the ring, and work your way inward towards the center., Get a shovel, and dig out the soil containing the mushrooms. Go about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) deep. Once you have dug out the mushrooms, you will need to expand the ring you just dug by 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) to either side.24 inches (60.96 centimeters) would be better. Some experts advise digging all the way to the center of the ring.


As you dig, try to determine the cause of the fairy ring. Look for rotting wood, construction debris, or anything that could keep water from draining. Remove any of these causes as you go.
 To avoid spreading the mushroom spores all over your garden, toss everything into a large garbage bag. Tie the bag up tightly, and toss it into the bin. Do not throw the mushrooms or the soil into your compost pile.
 Avoid using immature compost, which could contain mushroom spores. (Mature compost is great for soil drainage and sterilized by the composting process.)









If you have heavy clay soil, add sand to the mix to help with drainage.
 The grass will cover the soil on its own, but it can take a while. If you are in a hurry to get your lawn looking green again, you can cover the bare soil with some fresh sod (turf). You can also sprinkle some grass seeds over the soil instead.
