 You simply need a cup of sugar, four tablespoons of lemon juice, and four tablespoons of water. The sugar can be any kind of sugar, white, dark, brown, but only granulated. Powdered sugar is not an option. Put the ingredients together in a cup or a bowl.

, The reason you need such a big pot for a small batch is that the mixture starts to bubble and it can overflow if you use a small pot.
, When your mixture starts to bubble or become frothy, start mixing the batch with wooden or silver/metal spoon. Plastic spoons will melt.
 Check the color and see the consistency of the wax. If it is very sappy and syrupy, and the color is a dark auburn or dark brownish, it is ready. If it is not like this, put it back on the stove and cook it some more.
 If action is not taken then the wax will stick to the pot and end up ruining the pot or causing a major cleanup later. Find an empty jar that you won't be needing and let it cool for five to twenty minutes. The wax should be nearly solid, but still malleable. Liquid wax will burn you. If it is too hot to hold your finger to for more than a few seconds, let it cool some more.
 Again, the wax should be malleable but still hot/warm: not liquid. Apply the wax to your destined location in the opposite direction of hair growth.
 Rip in the opposite direction of your hair growth like a bandage. Get a firm grip on it, and it may hurt a little bit. You can also use your fingers to roll or pull it off. If no hair was pulled off, your hair is too short to be waxed or you did not make the wax correctly.
