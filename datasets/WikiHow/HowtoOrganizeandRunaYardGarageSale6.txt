 It's against the law, and you loose money.
 If they have a question then answer it. If they're being rude or disruptive then ask them to leave nicely.
 You'll need it if you're bad at math; some people will get mad if they're short of change, or will try make you think you didn't give them the right amount when you did.
 Being kind may help you with sales.
