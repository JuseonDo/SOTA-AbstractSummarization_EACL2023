note that since only the least significant of the two special bytes is used for this, you can also add 256 to the values listed above and use that special to get the same pokémon.

 Now that you know how the trick works, use it to catch other Pokémon. Fighting the Youngster will always result in a Mew encounter because his Slowpoke has a Special of 21 (15 in hex). But if you fight something else before returning to Route 8, it will change which Pokémon you encounter. For example, say you chose a starting Pokémon other than Bulbasaur and regret your decision. Bulbasaur's hex number is 99, which converts to 153 in decimal. Now, you could fight a wild Pokémon with a Special of 153, but the only place to find that is on a Level 64 Chansey in the Unknown Dungeon, and those Chansey are quite rare. Worse, they only have a one-in-sixteen chance of having the right Special. Fortunately, there is a solution: Ditto's Transform, which copies the stats of the opponent. This means that you can catch any Pokémon in the game by following the steps set forth in this section.
 You can find a complete list of which decimal value is needed for each Pokémon at the bottom of the page.
 Fly away from the Gambler battle.
,,,, This is important because there are a few Pokémon, such as Kangaskhan, whose identifying value is lower than the minimum Special that any Pokémon can have. In Kangaskhan's case, you can find her by using a Special of 258 (2 + 256).


Also note that when you perform this trick, any trainers you fight after the Gambler will be "used up." Make sure you have enough unused trainers to catch all the Pokémon you want! Fortunately, the Gambler can be used to initiate the trick an unlimited number of times.
