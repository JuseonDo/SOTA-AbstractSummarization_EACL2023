 Obviously, you will need something to take the photograph with. Although written with digital photography in mind, this will work with any camera.;
, A large light colored towel can be helpful for many things in photography.
 Practice before you need it.
 A bad photograph can be quickly improved by changing the angle and, therefore, the light.
 An image may look good, 'artistically', but it will not help prove a case or help rehome an animal.
 A calico cat against a busy background is really difficult to see.
 This will increase the flexibility of your camera and the conditions it can shoot in.
 It's called 'spray and pray'. Shooting at the subject with no real intent and hoping it comes out ok...or thereabouts.
 Especially if the goal is adoption, choose or create a photo to show what a wonderful animal it is. If it's an active dog, show it moving. If it's a particularly beautiful cat, groom it and take a close-up portrait. If there was abuse or neglect in the animal's past, and you can tastefully show a before-and-after of its recovery, do so.
 With a video, you increase your odds of a good story and good photographs.
