, Instead of hitting or pushing your cat away if it does something wrong, point to them and firmly say, "no", or spray some water onto them with a spray bottle. Your cat may not like it if you pick them up while they are upset or tired; some cats may not even want you to pick them up at all, so be careful if you try to.

 mice, golf balls, tin foil crumpled into a ball, paper balls, etc). If you have a big windowsill with a cushion, draw back the curtains, and your cat can relax and watch the birds.
,, Milk can be a nice treat for a cat, but do not give it milk all the time, because it is not good for them. After your cat has weaned, it will most likely become lactose intolerant. Try to give your cat a little bit of cow's milk to see if it causes diarrhea. If your cat is okay after that, then you may give them a bowl of milk every once in a while as a treat. While grown cats do not need milk, you can purchase lactose free cat milk from a supermarket or pet store to give them.
 You can also buy a product called LitterMaidÂ®, which cleans the litter for you instead of you having to do it.

If your cat tends to scratch up your furniture, a scratching post will be a great help. Make sure that if you catch them clawing on the furniture to direct them to the scratching post instead. They will soon learn to scratch on the post instead of the furniture.
