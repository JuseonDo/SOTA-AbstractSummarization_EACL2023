, Use a pastry cutter or similar to cut two shapes per sheet, big enough to cover the individual pie pans or dishes. Place one base into each individual pan or dish and push to fit the sides and base neatly., Give them a quick rinse and shake off the water., Add the sugar, flour and lemon zest. Mix gently to combine and coat the blueberries., Create a mound effect in the center of each berry pile. Finish with a dab of butter., Neatly press down on the edges to seal the two pieces of pastry together. Stroke the pastry a little to smoothly close it together., Let sit for half an hour.,, Brush each pie with water, then sprinkle with a little sugar over the top. Use a fork to stab a few series of holes in each pie top, to allow steam to escape during cooking., Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 355ºF and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until you can see blueberry juice coming out of the pies., Place on a wire cooling rack and allow to cool. These can be served warm or cold., Serve with whipped cream, ice cream or fresh berries.
