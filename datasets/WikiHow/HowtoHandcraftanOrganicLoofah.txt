,,, The inside should end up looking hollow.



You should now have two separate loofah pieces that are identical in shape and fit against one another.
 This will serve as the handle that lets you hold the loofah. It only needs to be long enough to fit across the cut-down loofah shape, with edges for tucking under.



Tuck each end of the fabric strip into the middle section of the loofah sponge on each side and sandwich into place.



When you have stitched around the entire loofah sponge, you will be able to hold it with the handle, as demonstrated in this image.
