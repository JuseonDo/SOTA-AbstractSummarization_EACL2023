 If you don't know where Mecha-Bowser is, watch YouTube videos to know where Mecha Bowser is.;
,, There will be another sling star on the other leg if there is a screw.
 One is a pipe and one is a magic Koopa. The pipe warps you to the arm and the bats.


These black things are enemies. You lose some of your health if you touch them.
 Then a launch star will take you to the Spring Mushroom.


Don't stand on the arm while falling for too long. You'll die and start over.
