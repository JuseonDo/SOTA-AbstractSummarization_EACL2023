 Avoid celeriac that looks brown or discolored., Run the celeriac under running water to remove any excess dirt.
 Cut off the bottom and top of the celeriac with a sharp knife. Then, use a potato peeler to remove the tough outer skin.Dice up the celeriac into ½ inch pieces.Expect to discard about a quarter of the celeriac one you have peeled and chopped it up.
 Once the olive oil just starts to simmer, add the chopped up celeriac, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook approximately 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the celeriac begins to soften.If you’re using dried or fresh thyme, add it in with the celeriac, garlic, salt, and pepper., Bring to a boil and then cook for about 20 - 25 minutes, until the celeriac is tender.


Once the celeriac is cooked, you should be able to easily pierce through a piece of celeriac with a fork.
 Then, return the celeriac to the pot.
 Ensure there are no lumps and the celeriac is smooth.


You can also use a masher for this step, but the blender will give you less of an arm workout.
 Heat them until the butter is melted, about 45 seconds.
 Puree the ingredients with the stick blender for another minute or use the masher until they are well combined.


If you’d like to make a sweeter celeriac mash, add in a pinch of ground nutmeg and a pinch of ground ginger.
 It may need a bit more salt or pepper, depending on your taste buds.


Serve the mash warm, sprinkling a handful of chopped parsley for some extra flavor and color.
