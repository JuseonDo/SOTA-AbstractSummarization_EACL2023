@summary
lay the fish on one side and cut just behind the top of the head until you hit the backbone.

@summary
continue this cut in an arc around the fish's head.

@summary
turn the knife and cut horizontally towards the tail, through the center of the fish.

@summary
flip the fish and repeat on the opposite side.

@summary
using a smaller knife, lift and remove the ribcage from the inside of the fillet.

@summary
scale the fish or remove the skin entirely.

@summary
alternatively, use a sharp knife to cut directly through the fish, perpendicularly, to form steaks.

 Don't cut through the spine, just to it.
 Again, you don't want to cut deeper than the backbone. You will not be cutting the head off, just cutting about halfway into the fish.
 You'll basically be cutting off the entire side of the fish, removing the whole flank, skin and all. The knife will travel perpendicularly to the backbone, which you can use as a guide to ensure a nice, flat cut.
 Simply repeat the same process on the other half of the fish, removing the other fillet.
 This will be the small, almost translucent set of bones on the lower third of fish fillet. It should come off in one piece.
 If you want to cook the fish with the skin still on, use the dull side of a knife to rake the scales off. Use a short, lifting motion from the tail to the head to quickly scrape all of the scales off. If you don't want the skin, simply slide the knife between the fish and the skin and simply cut the skin away., To do so, you simply cut perpendicular to the backbone, going all the way through the spine to get thick, 1" steaks. This is common with bigger fish -- trout and salmon -- and retains the spine running through the middle of the fish.
