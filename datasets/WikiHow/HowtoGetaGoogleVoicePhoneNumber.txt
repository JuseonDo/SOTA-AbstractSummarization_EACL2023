Call screening makes the person who is calling enter their name. It also tells them that they are using Google Voice. Most Google Voice users prefer a transparent system that users do not know is pulled together using Google Voice.
 This is only necessary if you want to make cheap international calls. You can check the rates for calls to foreign countries before you call.
 Using the app will allow you to call from your Google Voice number, send and receive text messages on your phone and view history easily on your phone.
 You can also import contacts from your phone or other sources.
