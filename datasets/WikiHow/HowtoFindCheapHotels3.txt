 You may get a good deal on hotels, hotel transfers, car rentals and more by booking what airlines call a “vacation.”

, Travel agents may be offering special deals on flights and hotels to fill their last few empty spots.
 You may be able to score a deal by booking an entire vacation (flight and hotel) just a week or two before you plan to travel. You must be extremely flexible.
