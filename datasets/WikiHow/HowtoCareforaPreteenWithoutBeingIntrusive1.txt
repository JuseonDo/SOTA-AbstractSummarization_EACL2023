get them to make their own breakfast.

@summary
if they need a snack, make it clear to them what they can have.

@article
 Let them do it themselves, but make sure there is always a selection of drinks, cups, mugs and glasses in easy reach of them so they can easily get drinks. Most children should be able to get drinks by themselves, but for children who need help:


Ask which drink they want.
Tell them to fetch it.
Ask them to fetch something to drink from.
Pour a little into the receptacle.
Tell them to pour some more if they want any more.
Tell them to put away the drink.
Give them the drink.;
,, A child of 10 or 11 will be able to pour some cereal, or toast some bread (if they eat porridge for breakfast, consider still making it, as you may not be happy letting them cook on a hob).
