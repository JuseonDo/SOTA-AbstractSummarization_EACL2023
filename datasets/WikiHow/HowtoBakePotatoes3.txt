 If you're not going to do anything with the baked potato after it's cooked, seasoning it with olive oil, salt and pepper might be a good idea.
 Aluminum foil is a good conductor of heat, meaning that the cooking time on baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil will probably go down. If you like baked potatoes with crispy skins, however, look out: wrapping in aluminum foil creates a potato with skin that is more steamed than crispy.
 Slower-cooked baked potatoes often have a creamier center.









Check the potato for doneness slightly before you think it may be finished cooking. Because the aluminum foil accelerates the cooking, you may want to check early to avoid an overdone potato.
