 Take them out of the freezer bag and place them in a strainer over a bowl. Allow them to thaw completely.
 Excess moisture will cause the beans to come out soggy.
 Use a whisk to stir the mixture until it is smooth.
 Allow the oil to heat until it is ready to fry. Test whether it's ready by inserting the handle of a wooden spoon. When bubbles start to form around the spoon, the oil is ready.


Don't use olive oil to fry, since it breaks down when heated to high temperatures. Peanut oil, vegetable oil or canola oil is a better choice.
 Put the beans inside the bag. Close it and shake well.
 Continue transferring beans until you have an even layer of beans.


Don't overcrowd the skillet, or the beans will turn out soggy.






Avoid overlapping the beans.
 Remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate made with paper towels to drain. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper, and serve hot.
