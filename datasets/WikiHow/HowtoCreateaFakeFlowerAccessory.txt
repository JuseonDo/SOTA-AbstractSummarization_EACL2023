 Craft or dollar stores are great places to find artificial flowers.;
, With a pair of scissors, cut the stem off of the fake flower. You want to make sure to cut enough off so that you are now working with a flat surface.
 Let the glue heat up for a few minutes before working with it.



Press it against the base of a blank pin for 15 seconds.
If you want something for your hair instead, glue the flower onto a plain barrette.
Depending on the size of the pin or barrette you get, you may be able to fit more than one flower onto your new accessory.
, After the flower is attached to the pin or barrette, decorate your flower as desired.


Use the hot glue gun for this as well.
Be creative! If you'd like, glue on sequins, beads or crystals to the fabric of the flower or to the remainder of the pin or barrette.
