 You may use black construction paper, or, if you have a printer, you may print black paper (both sides). If you have an all-in-one printer, keep the scanner cover open, put nothing inside and select copy. You will print out a black sheet of paper. Make sure to print the other side as well.
 You will need two strips (based on A4 size paper). If you have a paper cutter, a paper cutter will make this easier. Otherwise, use scissors and a ruler., Make sure you are using clear tape.,, Leave a small amount of paper unrolled, preferably 2in unrolled., Once done, the 2 rolls should be connected and look like the one in the image., Use a strip of cardboard, make an arch and place 2 holes on both left and right side for the sticks. Choose which side of the sticks to use as knobs. Then, with another piece of cardboard, cut 2 holes the size of the bottom of the arch so they fit snug inside. If necessary, use glue to hold in place., If built correctly, the dollar bill should be rolled inside.,,
