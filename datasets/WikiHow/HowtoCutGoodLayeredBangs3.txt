 Leave them too short and seek another solution such as getting the help of a professional stylist or wearing your bangs pinned up.
 If your side bangs came out a little too short, part your hair on the opposite side. Sweep the longer bangs over the shorter bangs so that the shorter bangs aren’t visible anymore., Try a head scarf or a headband where you can sweep your bangs back with the rest of your hair. You can also use a barrette to twist them to the side., Go to a stylist if you made your bangs crooked or in the wrong spot, but they still might be salvageable with some maneuvering. If your bangs are too short, talk to your stylist about adding in extensions like clip-in bangs and styling them to look like natural bangs.
