 Ask mom if the two of you can try some new stores. You might be surprised and find out that she is as tired of the old places as you are!;
, Is the clothing budget tight, and she knows the old stores offer clothes at a price she can afford? Or is her time limited, and she just can't imagine when she could browse new shops? Or perhaps she is nervous about the styles she's seen at other shops, and worries that the clothes might be too mature or revealing.
 If it's budget that has her worried, check out the prices at the newer stores. Are they comparable for similar items? Or even better, are they cheaper?

,, If your mom has rules about clothing styles, don't expect her to make the jump from GAP to Hot Topic. Compromise and find some shops that carry clothes to meet her rules and still express your changing tastes. Have a few items placed on hold, then try them on when mom is with you. Let her see that different styles can still be modest.
 You can bookmark the ones you like, and show mom your choices and the prices when you have some time together at home. Odds are, she'll appreciate your effort and the fact that she can see the clothes without driving to the store.
 You're trying to convince mom that that you're old enough to choose your own clothing stores. Whining, temper tantrums or screaming will never accomplish that, so even if mom says no this time, remain calm and thank her for listening. Your new level of maturity will convince her in the long run.
