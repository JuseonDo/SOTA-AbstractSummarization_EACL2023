 Add vegetable oil, such as safflower or canola, to a wok or deep pan and put it on a medium high heat. Be sure to leave at least two inches from the top to avoid oil spillage.
 Depending on how big your egg roll wrappers are, cut the hot dogs into halves or fourths., Be sure to have the wrapper in a diamond shape in front of you.


Take the corner of the wrapper nearest to you and fold it over the hot dog.






Fold in the sides on top of the first fold.






Dab the top ends with a very thin layer of water. Roll the wrapper up and seal the ends.
 Deep fry the egg rolls until golden in color and crispy on both sides.
