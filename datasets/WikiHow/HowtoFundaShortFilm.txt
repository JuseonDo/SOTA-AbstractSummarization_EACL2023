A serious pitfall for many short film producers is cost overrun after they have raised their initial goal. It's better to spend more time raising too much money than to find yourself in a situation where your film is half-done and you are out of funds.



Incorporation creates separate bank accounts for your film and for your personal life. If your film goes bankrupt, funds from your personal accounts will not be liable for collection.

Your business plan should be around 10 pages and should included detailed information about production costs, anticipated shooting time, locations, and predicted revenue. Provide a detailed budget.
Be sure to include information about yourself and the other people working on the film. Also indicate other sources from which you hope to raise money. Film investors will want to know that your team is responsible and that you will have enough money to cover all your costs.



Some well known institutions that provide film grants include the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States and the Canada Council. Also seek out local arts groups and corporate foundations.

Ask these businesses and professionals for a modest amount of money. Be frank about your expected costs, and do not promise any return on investment.
