 You can find it online, or in a well-stocked beauty supply store. You may also find it labeled as “hologram mirror powder."For the hologram look, choose something that is silvery or iridescent.;
, Apply your base coat first, then your favorite color. You can use any color you want—each color will create a slightly different look. The darker your base color is, the more dramatic the hologram effect will be.


If you are new to painting nails, consider using silver as your base color. This way, if you accidentally leave any gaps in the powder, it will be less noticeable., This will allow the powder to stick to it., As you tap the powder on, gently flick your brush downward. You can use a small brush, a special nail art applicator, or even one of those foam eye shadow brushes., Gently sweep the brush across your nail, starting from the base and going past the tip in a single stroke. This will not only get rid of any excess powder, but also help the powder lay more smoothly.Be sure to sweep to either side of your nail to remove any powder that might be stuck to your skin.
The best brush for this would be a soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush or a kabuki brush.
 Be sure to sweep it across the top of your nail, as well as down the sides. This will seal your manicure, and prevent it from peeling., This should only take about 60 seconds. Once it is done, your nails are ready to show off!
