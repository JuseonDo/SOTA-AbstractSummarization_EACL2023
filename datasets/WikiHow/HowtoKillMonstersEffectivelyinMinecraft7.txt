, Endermen will teleport next to you if you look at them for a few seconds.
 This won't hurt it, they always teleport before the arrow hits, but it will provoke the Enderman to attack you in melee.
 Looking down at its feet will prevent it from teleporting away. Eye contact will make it teleport.
 Keep spinning around, as it teleports in random places around you. Listen for the sound of teleportation to know when you're in danger.
 Endermen are three blocks tall and cannot fit in such spaces.
