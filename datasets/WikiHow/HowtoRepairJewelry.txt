 Depending upon the damage, some steps may not apply. Acquire the needed materials at a hobby shop or bead store.
 Wear reading glasses or use a free-standing magnifying glass, if needed.
 Open the jump rings. These are the 2 circles that link each side of the clasp to the chain; each of these rings contains a slit.
 Place 1 set of needle-nosed pliers in your dominant hand, and clamp the pliers on 1 side of the jump ring's slit. The slit should be facing toward the ceiling. Pick up the second set of needle-nosed pliers in your other hand and clamp it on the other side of the slit. Open the slit wider by slowly pulling in opposite directions. Repeat on the other jump ring on the other side of the necklace.
 Slip the new jump rings and clasp onto the jump rings. Close gently with pliers, using the method you have just learned. You can use this method to repair clasps and chain links.
 Save all original parts; they will be used to make a pattern for the new hinge.;
, Make a divot into the bracelet or necklace, where the hinge is attached. Use a small steel punch to push out the pin. Use the ball burr to make the divot in the other side. You will reattach the new hinge to these divots.
 Count the number of times the coil circles. Take an 8 inch (20.3Â cm) piece of guitar string. Coil the guitar string around the pliers according to the number of times the original hinge was coiled. Use a heavy duty wire cutter to trim the excess guitar string. Further shape the coil according to the original hinge. Place it within the bracelet to ensure a good fit.
 Use a torch to ball the bottom end of the wire. Use a steel block to hammer the wire flat.
 Put the rivet through the coil. Check the coil tension. Cut the string with wire cutters, then hammer the rivet flat on the other side. Polish and buff.
