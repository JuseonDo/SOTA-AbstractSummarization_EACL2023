, Some will have bunny foil others will have candy. Save all of them.
, After you find twelve pieces of foil, you will have gotten all of the furniture from the bunny.
 All of the pieces go for around ten thousand each.
, He is the only jack that doesn't walk towards you. Be careful, as if you pick the wrong person they will take a piece of candy from you. A good way to avoid this is to put the candy in letters slots that contain letters.
 Tell him you have candy. Give him the candy you will get a piece of the spooky furniture collection. Sell it for major bells.
