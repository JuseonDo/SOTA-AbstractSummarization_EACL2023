extend curtain life by adding a protective lining.if you’ve chosen a fragile curtain fabric or if the curtains will be exposed to a lot of sunlight, you can prolong their life by using a protective lining.

 Choose long lengths and hang the panels high to create a sense of height and intensity. At minimum, hang them 6 inches above the window frame. Go even higher to create a lavish, powerful effect.For rooms with low ceilings, consider floor-to-ceiling drapes, which will create the illusion of more space.
 Thick drapes will make a small room feel even smaller and create a stuffy, uncomfortable feeling. Go with breezy sheer materials or lightweight fabrics to create a more open feeling in small spaces.Avoid lining altogether, which serves to make the overall appearance of any curtains much heavier.
 For a more traditional look, go with curtains that extend a few inches beyond the floor. This will create a very classic looking puddle effect.


Choose shorter lengths if you have children and/or pets to prevent curtains from getting damaged.
If you battle excessive dust in a particular room, go with curtains that don’t reach the floor. Otherwise they will get dirty very quickly.
 This will slow down the fading effect that the sun has on bright colors.


Unless you plan on changing out your curtains often, use lining to lengthen the shelf life of your drapes.
