, Simply press a length of tape sticky-side down over the point of the pin, place the pin against the blunt end of the pencil, and wrap the tape down over the sides to secure the pin in place. Apply additional pieces of tape if necessary.
 Fold two more post-its and arrange them so that all three creases meet in the middle, forming a three-pointed wing on the end of the dart. Tape the papers together. Repeat steps 2 and 3 on the remaining pencils.
 Draw or print out a picture of a dart board (or your nemesis) and pin it up on a bulletin board or soft cubicle wall. The soft backing will allow the darts to stick when thrown. Then start playing darts.
