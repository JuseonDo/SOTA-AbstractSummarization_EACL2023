,,, Baggy clothes make people look less attractive.
, But no tennis shoes with dresses. Try flats or heals instead.
 And don't wear any jeans that are too small or too big.
 Ooh, la-la!

, Mix and match. With a red sundress, try green bangles and orange hoop earrings.
 Get a wardrobe change. If you can't afford every week, try every month, or every other month.
 Flats, tennis shoes, and heals!

,,,,, Nothing says 'fierce' louder! Try bright colors on black, and black or white on bright colors! Add a little POP to the funeral!(Not saying that you should be attending one!)

, Everyday. Skinny jeans in a bright color. Or several colors. But denim isn't as good as he once was. He is getting less and less popular.
 Short dresses for a party or girls-night-out and long ones for a prom or wedding. (Well, for the bride, okay. Many bridesmaids have short dresses,..)

, Old age ain't gonna stop me! (Is it going to stop you?)

, You don't need makeup to get a man's attention! Just be proud and you'll stand out.
