 The first step for dealing with a dead animal underneath your house is when you first notice something you should looking into it! Although this sounds like a "duh" point many people will wait too long. There are two main ways that people first become aware of this problem: Smelling the odor or actually seeing the animal.;
, If you can see the animal, then it is pretty self explanatory that you should use proper gloves to put it in a garbage bag and properly dispose of it according to your local area regulations.
 If all you notice is an odor, many people will not choose to do anything about it right away. This is where the problem escalates very, very quickly. The longer the animal is left under your house the stronger the odor will become due to the bacteria and rotting carcass. This will also make the clean up much more difficult


Is there a bad smell? You need to investigate. Many times it might be just garbage or a rotten piece of food, but it is worth looking into.
 If one is missing then there is a great chance an animal is causing that smell.
 Obviously a best way to locate the dead animal is to use your nose to follow the odor. But many times they crawl up in to your insulation that makes this a lot harder, without tearing down all the insulation. There are two things to look for before pulling down some insulation; first you should look for a saggy spot that is lower that everywhere else. Second is to look and listen for flies because they will lead you too the dead animal most likely.
 Basic solution for cleaning is bleach and water, but there are many great commercial cleaning solutions out there.
