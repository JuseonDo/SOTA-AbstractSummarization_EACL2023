 Adoption doesn't have to be a big deal, and you may or may not want to mention it to your friends.


If you want to tell a few close people, explain to them whether it's a big deal to you, and whether you want everyone to know or not.
If you want to tell someone but don't know how then try and tell them somewhere else or in a different way. Try and tell them through a letter, text message or an e-mail. If that doesn't work then you could try and ask them for a day out and tell them that you have a really big secret that is for their ears only and that they aren't to tell anyone.
 Your knowledge regarding them may have changed, but their love for you is still the same.
 Personality is part genetic and part environmental. Perhaps you learned your father's patience, or your mother's passion for science. Maybe your older sister's hard work in school inspired you in your devotion to the arts. They are still part of you.
 These are still part of you. Even if you aren't genetically related to your adoptive family, the love and memories are real.
