 If you bring your own, make sure that it has current southern African maps on it.
 This is required under South African law.
 If you're from a country with right side drive, it can be a challenge to switch driving modes and requires constant vigilance. This means not driving when you are tired, as you are more likely to lapse into driving the way that feels most natural.


It also takes time to learn the rhythm of how people drive in another country, so be wary at all times, including being prepared for suddenly stopping vehicles, such as minibus taxis.
Watch for aggressive driving. Gary Ronald, spokesman for the Automobile Association of South Africa, says that aggressive driving in South Africa can intimidate people who are not used to it.
 If you try to drive on roads with potholes and poorly sealed surfaces, damage to the car could leave you stranded and vulnerable. For long trips, plan your route in advance, and be sure that the car is in good working order, and that you have adequate fuel and cash.
 Items such as cameras, handbags, iPods, laptops, parcels, etc., should be kept in the trunk (boot) of the car.
When driving through a downtown area that is crowded, keep the car windows up and all the doors locked.This will prevent anyone from attempting to reach in when you're waiting at lights, etc.
Don't give anyone a lift.
Lock car doors when you park. Park in well-lit areas and set the alarm if you have one.
If you get lost, ask a police or traffic officer for directions.
