 You can make fun, whimsical flowers using ribbons with patterns and polka dots, or take a more realistic approach by picking out ribbon in a hue reminiscent of petals. Here's what you'll need to make flowers from ribbon:









A 12-inch length of ribbon
A needle with thread that matches the ribbon

, This stitch weaves through the ribbon, allowing you to create the shape of a flower when you're finished.









Thread the needle. Tie a knot at the end of the thread. This will hold it in place.
Push the needle, from front to back, into the ribbon, along the edge. Pull the thread through until it is stopped by the knot. Push the needle, from back to front, and pull the thread through. Repeat this to complete the running stitch.
 This should cause the ribbon to bunch before you finish the running stitch. This step will create the basic form of your ribbon flower: the petals.
 Otherwise known as backstitching, this will secure the form of your ribbon flower.
 The tails of the ribbon should hang down from your hand as you hold the flower.
 Stitch first up, then down. Secure the thread with a knot (or 2 if necessary).
 By cutting as close as possible to the stitch line, your flower will hold its circular shape.
