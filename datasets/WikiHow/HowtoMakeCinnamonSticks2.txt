 Place parchment paper or a silicone pad across the baking sheet to prevent sticking.
 Beat until soft peaks form.
 Continue beating until the egg white peaks turn stiff.
 Fold into the egg whites.
 Mix to combine. Fold into the egg white mixture.
 For each cookie, you'll need two level teaspoonfuls of batter.
 Leave room between each of the cookies to allow for slight spreading.
 Bake for 6 to 7 minutes or until the edges appear golden.


While the cookies are baking, oil the handle of a wooden spoon; this will be used to roll the cookies up into sticks.
 Let cool on the cookie sheet for 2 to 3 seconds.
 Slide each rolled cookie off and onto a wire cooling rack.
 If they cool too quickly to be rolled as you're working through them, simply place the sheet back into the warm oven (no longer switched on) for up to a minute to just warm. Then remove and repeat until all cookies have been rolled into sticks.
 If wished, tie a small gold or silver cord around each cinnamon stick and tie in a bow. This is optional but very pretty, especially for gift-giving or a seasonal party.
