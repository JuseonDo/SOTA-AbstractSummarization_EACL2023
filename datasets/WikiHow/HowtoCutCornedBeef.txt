, Place it on a warm surface.
 Rest it for 10 to 15 minutes before you cut it.
,,, This is the pattern of visible long muscle fibers that run parallel to each other.









Brisket cuts have longer, tougher muscle fibers, because the cut of meat comes from areas that are built up when the animal was alive.
The grain is not the same as grill marks. If you have used a grill to cook meat, remember the grill marks are often arbitrary and they have nothing to do with the muscle fibers in the meat.
 Your knife should run perpendicular to the grain, instead of parallel.









Slicing against the grain allows you to cut muscle fibers so that they are very short and no longer touch. If you leave muscle fibers long and intact, they remain strong and very hard to chew.
, Serve immediately.
