 This is the longest installation process, because you are actually replacing your sink tap with a Brita brand tap and hoses.
 Run your tap water and insert the testing strip Consult the instructions to see under what filtration setting you should set the filter according to your results.
, Place a bucket underneath the pipes. Unscrew the pipes with a wrench so that you can remove your current kitchen sink faucet.
 Keep the directions close at hand in case you need to identify parts.
 The shank is a collar-like metal piece.
 Screw the blue hoses into the hole marked “C.” Screw the red hose into the hole marked “H.”


Screw the last hose into the hole marked “B.” Make sure they are secure.
 Screw it into the bottom of the tap.
, Pull the hoses and shank through the hole.
 Loop them through the hoses in that order.
 Adjust the dispenser at the top, so that it is positioned correctly. Fix the dispenser in place at the bottom using a wrench.
 The red hose will connect with the hot water supply. Next, insert the gasket into the T-piece, which you will place over the cold water intake.
 Insert the gaskets into the remaining hoses. Connect each side to the Brita filter device.
 The system is ready. Install the wall mount to hold your filter device in place so that it can be unscrewed and replaced when it is no longer effective.
 Run the faucet. Check for leaks.
 Unlock the current filter, release the pressure handle and pull the filter out. Replace it with a new filter and secure the locking handle.


Reset your timer. Recycle your Brita cartridge.
