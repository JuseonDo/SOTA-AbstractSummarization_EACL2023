 The theme can be anything, from candyland to a zoo. However, remember that this is a lasting decision, as once finished, themes are time consuming (but not impossible!) to reverse, as you must pick up EVERY pattern in your town!;
, For example, if you want a city town, you might want some paving, manholes, zebra crossings and parking designs. Try to chose a town theme that isn't too hard to make, such as "The world is about to end!". Although it does sound cool, you'd have to use up a lot of time and bells making that theme. Once you've made other designs, place them around town.
 If this isn't possible, you may have to create extra or select characters to hold the designs. (A top tip: Place designs worth keeping on the clothes rack, or even another memory card, if you have one!)

, For example, if your theme is "Rainbow", then you might want to consider making rainbow clothing for the villagers.br>
, For example, if your town theme is "Iron", you'll probably want some gyroids or lab flooring.
