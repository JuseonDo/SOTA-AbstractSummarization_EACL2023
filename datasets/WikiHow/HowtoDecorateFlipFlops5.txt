, Do you want to use all one color or a variety of colors? Decide on the color scheme before selecting the pompoms.
 Do you want all the same size of pompom or varying large and smaller ones? Large ones can be placed in the center of the straps, while smaller ones can be lined down the sides of the straps.
 Keep the color and size arrangement as planned.
 Allow to dry completely before wearing.
