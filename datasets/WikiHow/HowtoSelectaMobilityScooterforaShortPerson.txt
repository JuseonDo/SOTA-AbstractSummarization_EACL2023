look for a scooter with a seat-to-deck height that can be shortened to 16" or below.

@summary
find a scooter with a shorter overall length of 40" or less, so that you can easily reach the controls.

if you're also smaller in width, choose a scooter with a smaller seat.

 Many scooters only lower to 18", which may leave your feet dangling in the air. Measure from the back of your knee to the floor to make sure the height works for you.;
, Some scooters have tilting handles which help.
 Most scooter seats are 18"-20" in width/length, but smaller seats are available. The chair we recommend comes with an optional 14"x14" seat for instance
