 Press the Power button on the front of the console. The PS3 cannot be in Standby mode.;
, You'll find the Mini-USB port on the back of the controller.
 You'll find two or four on the front of your PS3, depending on the model.
 You'll find this button in the center of the controller. This turns the controller on.
 Once a single light is on, your controller is synced with the PS3. The light that is on indicates which controller you are using (P1, P2, etc.).
 You can now use the controller wirelessly.


Bluetooth wireless functionality is only available on official Sony DualShock 3 controllers.
 If your controller turns off after unplugging it, it may be out of charge. Keep it plugged in for a few hours with the PS3 on to charge the battery.
 If you still can't get your controller to sync with the PS3, you may need to reset it:


Turn over the controller and locate the Reset button. You can find it along the top of the backside, near the L2 button.
Use the paperclip to press the Reset button. You should be able to feel it click.
Try connecting and syncing the controller again.
