@summary
begin working the horse daily in a 40’ round pen.

@summary
,

@summary
walk, trot and canter both directions until the horse begins to relax and give up.

@summary
initially, for the first 3-5 days or more, the horse will not appear to relax and it means being patient and continuing to work him.

@summary
repeat this process every day until you begin to see the signs that the horse is becoming respectful of you as the herd leader (as indicated by head position, licking lips, turning to face you when he stops, etc.).
@article
, Try working off-line (meaning the horse is wearing only a halter) and do not have a longe-line on him; you may find it gives them the freedom to make good choices quicker as they feel less restricted/confined. Voluntary actions/reactions seem to stay with them longer.
 Ask him to walk, trot and canter until he’s tired and wants to stop. If you let him stop and he doesn’t crop his head, lick his lips or cock his inside ear toward you or voluntarily turn to face you even a couple steps (which he won’t) you ask him to go back to work. Repeat that process until the horse begins to drop his head as he travels, cock his inside ear towards you and and lick his lips. When he stops he should turn slightly towards you (but typically don’t turn and fully face you as they eventually will).
 That is the point of this entire process: to teach a horse who may otherwise have a domineering or bully attitude, to accept the handler as the herd leader and afford them the appropriate respect. Once the horse has accepted its handler as leader, it becomes easier to discipline ears pinned back and testy behavior.
