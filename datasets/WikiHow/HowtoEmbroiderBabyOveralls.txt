 Most baby clothing will unsnap, or unbutton. Open those overalls up completely.;
, Areas of single fabric thickness are best... i.e.: along the pant leg, or on the back.
 You may do this on paper, OR you may do this directly on the fabric with tailor's chalk or similar marker that will wash out. (test this in an inconspicuous area BEFORE you draw the entire thing...)

, Several needles, and a skein of each color of thread you will need for your design.
 There are embroidery hoops of every size available, but not all baby clothing is large enough to use one.
, Some stitches such as French Knots work best with the full 6 strands of thread normally found in Embroidery floss. Finer details will require using fewer strands at a time to accomplish the effect desired. A common number of strands is two, but you should use your own best judgment.
 Both methods have their advantages. Dark thread first prevents getting your lighter colors dingy with repeated rubbing and holding of the piece during stitching. Working out from the center has the advantage of being adjusted as you go. (starting at the outside will restrict any changes you can make later.)

, Even the gentlest of tugs on the embroidery floss can pucker the fabric and make the garment not fit correctly when you're finished.
