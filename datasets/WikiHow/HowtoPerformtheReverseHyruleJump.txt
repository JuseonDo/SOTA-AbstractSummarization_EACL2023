 (Don't use the control stick to jump mid-Up-B; this cancels it.);
, Immediately, jump, and use your second jump when you start falling. When you are almost under the upper ledge, use your Up-B. The next part can be tricky, but you should be high enough to wall jump off the small wall under the edge, and barely grab the edge. There are rumors that Sonic can perform the Reverse Hyrule Jump without using his Up-B, but these are unconfirmed.
 Jump off the bottom platform and double jump at the right time. Use the Wario Bike, and jump off at the apex of the bike's ascent. Use the Waft, and your flatulence will rocket you up so high that you should not need to use his Up-B.
 (Note: Use the jump button, not the control stick, to start gliding.) Dive down then swoop up to just below the edge. Finally, use the Shuttle Loop, Mach Tornado, or even the Dimensional Cape. Meta Knight can also claim the honor of doing the RHJ without using his Up-B.
 (Robot in Japan): Jump, double jump, then use your Up-B once. (Stop using the Up-B by not pushing the control stick up.) Use your backwards aerial attack, which pushes you forward. Use the Up-B/B-Air combo until you are on top.
 However, he was great at jumping. First, fully charge your Shadow Ball and save the charge. Then, jump backwards and fire off the Shadow Ball, and the recoil will push you back fairly far. Then double jump and use your Up-B, and you should grab the edge.
 When you use Pound in mid-air, if you press Up on the control stick immediately afterwards, you will lose no height; this is called the Rising Pound. So, follow this pattern for the RHJ: Jump, Rising Pound, Jump, Rising Pound, etc. Jigglypuff can also perform the RHJ without her Up-B (as it does not raise her height in the slightest.
