Clear and precise explanations of how to interact with others and monitoring will decrease situations that result in biting.
Discuss and give examples of sharing, taking turns and respecting space.
Monitor and correct children not following the guidelines as needed.;
,


Quickly stop and correct the child as the biting is about to occur.



Biting often occurs out of frustration and inability to express feelings.
Help your child use words rather than actions for expressing his or her feelings. Use words such as "I am mad" or "I didn't like it when..."
Model expressing feelings in words. Children mimic parents. Allow your child to hear your use words rather than actions to cope with your own emotions.



Praising good behaviors will lead to more good behavior.
Give positive feedback when the child shares and plays with others in a kind manner.



Let your child choose between items when it comes to clothing, foods and toys.



A child that is never allowed to interact with others will not understand appropriate social behaviors.
Take your child to parks, play dates, grocery stores, and other public places where children can be found.



Fear can lead to biting and other aggressive behaviors.



Play games, read, and talk to the child daily to prevent the child from biting for attention purposes.



Give clear direction that negative actions such as biting can cause negative corrections such as time-out or leaving the group.



Children test limits. They want to know how much you will let them get away with doing.
