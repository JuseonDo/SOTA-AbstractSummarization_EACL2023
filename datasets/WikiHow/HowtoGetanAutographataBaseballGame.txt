 You should also get up front during batting practice or warm-ups. Players will sign items before the game with generosity.;
, You may not be able to get the autograph during the game but can try to catch a player after the game, before the game during warm ups or post game near the player exit.

Keep a pen which is permanent and won't bleed or discolor for them to use.
Check hobby stores or memorabilia stores for a pen that is ideal for collecting quality autographs.
Bring a quality photograph from home or use a photo sold by the gift shop.

Depending on how the day is going you may get a "yes" or "no".
Players appreciate respect because they've got dozens of fans yelling at them all at once. They'll be more inclined to sign if you call out to them using their name. And using the proper term of respect such as "Mr Guerrero" rather than "Vladdy" will give you much more success.
Don't take rejection personally. They may just not be in the mood for it at the particular game you're attending.
Try again the next game, perhaps he will remember you, and give in. Be polite, even if they tell you "no;" there's always next time.
 Then you can bring the photo back for an autograph.
 Tell him how much you love the team, how many games you've been to.
 Be friendly and don't ask tabloid type questions about the team or their personal life. They will likely get offended.
