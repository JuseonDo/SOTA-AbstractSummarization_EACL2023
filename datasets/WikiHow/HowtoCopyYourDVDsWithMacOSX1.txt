Select the DVD in the finder and then press Command+I to get info about the disc. Check out the used space to see how large the disc is.

Check your hard disc space. If you have 5 gigs more available space on your hard drive than used space on the DVD, you can continue ripping DVDs.
 You can find it in the Applications folder, located in the Utilities section.
 It should be in the white pane on the left-hand side.
 A “Save As” dialog box will appear.


Name the new image.
Choose a destination where you want to save to the DVD.
Set the image format (at the bottom; not format) to DVD/CD Master.
Set the encryption to None.
Click Create and OSX will create your image file with a .cdr extension., You can watch the movie straight from your hard drive if desired, or convert it and burn a new disc.
 Once you've created your CD/DVD master as a .cdr file, it's a good idea to convert to .dmg by saving as a compressed format if you want to burn a copy. The .cdr is usually too large.


To convert the file, select convert in the top menu. Choose image format "Compressed" and "None" under Encryption. Add a .dmg extension on the file and you'll be ready to burn.
