@summary
before relying on a game theory decision, make a decision based on what information you have such as: the kick returner is at his top form today, or we should do an onside kick because the linemen are in (the hands and speed players are not in).

@summary
decide to use a game theory approach.

@summary
abstain from using the formation onside kick and use the surprise (no formation) onside kick to avoid telegraphing.

@summary
,

@summary
quantify the directions, in this case "might" try an onside kick.

@summary
use your wristwatch's (or a wall clock) second hand as a randomizing device.

@summary
,

@summary
divide the 12 numbers on the watch into two: the first set of numbers is from 1 to 50 seconds and the second set from 51 to 60.

@summary
assign 60% to your watch, like this: do an onside kick if, when you suddenly look at your watch the second hand on 1 to 30 seconds (6/10 of the way through the first set).

@summary
the decision making will be instantaneous after looking at your watch just once.

@summary
if you do not understand, go through this second football example.

, Be prepared for doing an onside kick from practices, your kicker has to be skillful, kick deep if the hands special team is in, and be prepared for the consequences if the onside kick fails.
, Might quantified is a bit subjective, but for this example make it 60%. So, 60% of the time try an onside kick and hope for a turnover. Quantify the directions you follow and some words (also phrases) to quantify are: usually, mostly, always, sometimes, occasionally, rarely, should etc.
, Since, time is in twelves but percentages is in tens, it would nice to have a watch with just 10 numbers, but this is not so.
 Also do an onside kick if the second hand was in the second set of numbers and on and between 51 seconds and 56 seconds (6/10 of the way between the second set).
 In some game situations, the decisions have to be made quick, and this method has you looking at your watch just once. Not acting predictably, puts uncertainty into the game and spreads the other team, amongst other things. Acting predictably is not good.
 You are basically a short yardage team and the defense is getting tough to beat. Make a plan to make a longer pass 10% of the time. This time when you look at your watch, if the second hand is on 1 to 5 seconds, or on the 51st second, pass longer. Going long 10% of the time will help spread the defense and make the short yardage work better. The decision has to be random and not methodical, for example going long every 10th play would be predictable.
