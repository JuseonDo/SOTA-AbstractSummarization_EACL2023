 Parent options include another classroom or building, another school within the same district, a different district, a charter school, private school, or homeschooling. Remember to inspect the buildings for the options, first - and do everything legally, within state law.
 Lists of physicians are available on www.schoolmoldhelp.org on the Resources - Medical page.
 Many schools in America are suffering from mold infestations and poor indoor air quality - even new schools are not exempt.
