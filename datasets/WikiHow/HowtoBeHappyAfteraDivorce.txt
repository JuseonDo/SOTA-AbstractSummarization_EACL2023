@article
 There were two people involved and it takes both to make a happy marriage.;
, So think positive and let go of the past.
 Go forward and do the things you have always wanted to do.
, But to make correct decisions you need to learn more about topics like finance, car insurance, investments, things you may not have dealt with before. This can be done only by learning, reading and contemplating and then taking the decision.
 You do not have to be married to be happy. You can do whatever it is in life that you wanted to do. You are no longer on a time schedule to meet your partners needs, and you do not have to ask anyone's permission to do anything. Best of all, you do not have loads of dirty wash.
 Join groups if that's what you want to do. Read a book on the park bench, go to a movie, or just watch the soaps on TV.
