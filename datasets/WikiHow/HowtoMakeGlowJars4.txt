 Jars filled with paint and water can make great glow jars. If you add glitter to them, they can be used as timers or calming jars. Here's what you'll need to make one:


Jar with lid
Water
Glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent paint
Black light (if using fluorescent paint)
Super fine scrapbooking glitter

, Do not fill the jar all the way with water. The paint will add volume once you add it.
 The more paint you add, the more intense the glow will be. You can use fluorescent paint or glow-in-the-dark paint. Here are differences between the two:If you use fluorescent paint, you will need a black light in order to make the paint glow. The paint will stop glowing if you take the black light away.
If you use glow-in-the-dark paint, you will need to leave it under a bright light for at least 15 minutes. It will glow in the dark for up to an hour.
 You will only need about a teaspoon or so. Try to match the glitter color to the paint color.
 You can also put a line of super glue around the rim of the jar before you close it. This will prevent anyone from opening the jar and making a mess.
 Keep shaking until the water is an even color. There should be no swirls or clouds of paint.
 Unlike glow-in-the-dark paint, fluorescent paint cannot be "charged." It needs to be next to a black light in order to glow. The minute you take it away from a black light, it will stop glowing.


You can buy black lights at party stores and craft stores.
 After this, the jar will glow on its own for up to an hour. You can re-charge the jar however many times you want.
 If you are using a black light, turn the regular lights off, and the black light on.
 The paint and water may separate over time. If the paint sinks to the bottom of the jar, simply shake the jar to mix it up again.
