 Typically, younger kids will do better with smaller sections.;
,,, You can also use common childhood tunes (Twinkle, Twinkle; This Old Man; Old MacDonald, etc...)

,, Read the verse out loud to the group or class. Ask the group to repeat the verse with you. Remove one key word from the projection and ask one child to volunteer to read the verse with the missing word. Allow one boy and one girl to quote the verse. Remove another word and repeat previous step. Continue until children can say verse from memory.
