 The reason for this is because Mudkip has the most advantage over any other starter in the game. Train your Mudkip and by the 6th gym leader, you should have a Swampert.;
, Abra evolves at level 16 into Kadabra then evolves in a trade. Again, by the 6th gym leader, you should have an Alakazam.
 These are usually found at level 9-12. At the 6th gym leader, you should have a Lairon.
 This is important, because Altaria (Swablue's evolution) is a powerhouse. Again, by the 5th or 6th gym leader, you should have an Altaria (evolves at Lv 35).


When you are going just north of Slateport City, there are patches of grass where you can find an Electrike. They evolve at level 26 and you should have a Manectric by the 4th gym leader.
 They are very important because the can take many hits when it evolves (Lv 37) into Dusclops.
