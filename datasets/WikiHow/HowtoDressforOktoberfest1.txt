 Traditional blouses are relatively high-cut, but a low-cut peasant blouse may also work if you feel like being a bit daring.;
, A dirndl is a specific type of dress that consists of a full skirt and a low, sleeveless top similar to what you would find on overalls. It is meant to be worn over a blouse. Many have a bodice-like design on the top, but some do not. Traditional dirndl dresses are tailored and frequently made of hand-printed material, so they can be expensive.



Pick out a cotton A-line or circle skirt. Choose one in black, red, dark green, brown, or sky blue. The skirt should be knee-length to floor-length, with the most traditional option being the long floor-length skirt.
Wear a laced-up bodice over your blouse. Authentic bodices are made of velvet or felt. If you can find a bodice with thick straps that go over your shoulder, that would mimic the look of a traditional dirndl best.
 The apron must match the length of the skirt.
,, Flats and low-heeled shoes are preferable to high-heels.
