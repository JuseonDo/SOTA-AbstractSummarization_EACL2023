wash it with a shampoo that leaves your hair healthy and shiny, and use a moisturising conditioner.

so if you have mid length to long hair, while your hair is still wet, split your hair into two and plait both sides.

if you have shorter hair, simply leave it down loose and put in an accessory or two, like a flower or a cute alice band.

 You can also treat yourself to a hair mask for extra gloss.
 Leave your hair for a while before drying it with a hairdryer. Make sure both plaits are perfectly dry before taking out the plaits. Your hair should be wavy and look cute and girly. Either leave your hair down and use some moose before adding in a flower clip or band, or you can create a romantic up-do. Try a low side bun or pinning sections of hair onto the back of your head.
 If it's long enough, curl your hair and create some soft waves, and like with long hair, use some moose before spritzing with hairspray.
