, This licorice should reach the top of each bag; if it sticks out, you can cut off the extra for neatness.
 Be careful to ensure that the licorice strands are hidden inside all of the orange (bunching them in the middle is helpful).
 Use the green ribbon and tie in a bow. The green licorice strands should be poking out above and give the appearance of a carrot top, along with the bunched up plastic.
 They can also be added to an Easter basket or hidden outside as a treat to be found from the "Easter bunny".
