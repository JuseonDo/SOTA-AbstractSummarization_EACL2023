 This is a danger zone for cast iron, during which it is the most unstable and difficult to work with. This will usually mean heating or cooling the iron before and during the work.;
,, If cold, you can sometimes run the machinery to get it up to the desired temperature.
 Hotter patches can ruin the weld, and cold patches will take too long to heat up to welding temperature. Consult your engineering specifications documents to know the best temperature for the exact iron formula you are using in your project.
