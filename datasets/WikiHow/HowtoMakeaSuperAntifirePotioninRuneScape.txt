, Anti-fire potions includes a vial of water, dragon scale dust, and a clean lantadyme herb.
 Phoenix feathers can be obtained by plucking a desert phoenix, located inside the gorge of River Elid. Be sure to have food or a life point healing in your inventory, as the phoenix may stun you and give you between 10 to 150 life point damage.
 Be careful with this since if you click on the potion first, you will consume a dose and will need to recreate a 3-dose or purchase a single dose at the Grand Exchange.
