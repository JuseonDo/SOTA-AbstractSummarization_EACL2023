 Make sure that you don't use a slim table for this. Take a wide, big table, a basin (with the drain plugged off!) or better still, do it in your yard or garden.;
, Take a small separate plastic bag and put the locks it that. Else, you can place it on another tissue paper, wrap it up and tie it tightly.
 Search for a good mug or container. The more wider, bigger and lightweight it is, the better.
 Put all your earrings in delicately. Be careful not to drop them from too high so that the stones or beads in it come loose.
 Add in a mild detergent (like Biokleen Automatic Dish Gel). Mix the water well but be careful not to move the earrings.
 They may be a bit slippery so be careful.
 Scrub the earrings gently. Be careful not to rub too hard on the beads and gems. They may fall out. Use the blunt end of a bobby-pin to clean out the crevices.
 Do the job thoroughly so that no grease from the detergent is left on the earring. It will cause trouble later.
 Make sure not to scrub it too hard. For quicker results, hold up your earrings in one hand and use the hairdryer. Two other options include using a heater or laying them in the sun.
 Do this task well. Your earrings are now good as new.
