@summary

(Chord formations for other tunings are given in the sections following);
, In tablature, this would be o-X-o-X-o-X, with the "o" representing an open string, and the "X" representing a blocked/muffled string (as you're looking at the face of the instrument). This leaves you with C, E, and G, which are the notes of a C major chord. Now just strum your right hand across all the strings, much like playing the guitar., Like this: X-o-X-o-X-o. This gives you the notes D-F-A, which form a Dm chord.
