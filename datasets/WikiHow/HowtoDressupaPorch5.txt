 They will reflect light and scenery.,, You don’t have to wire them if you don’t want to; just hang them so that no wires are exposed, or hang candle sconces., You can get 2 curtain panels and drape them over a rod and let them hang loosely on either side of the window frame., You can use a curtain rod or a piece of copper tubing and attach the curtains with clips. Tie the curtains back on windy days or rearrange them throughout the day to filter the sun., They don’t have to necessarily be Christmas light; think of how outdoor restaurants use mood lighting in the evening to create a warm glow outdoors. You can do the same on your porch.
