 Also get a ton of seashells or other stuff that's common., Write "How are you?", using perfect spelling and grammar. It is important that you send the letter with a fruit or seashell attached, otherwise you will rarely get presents back from your villagers. Also, only write one line, as other length (2, 3,4) will get you wallpapers and rugs., Or, set the time forward a few days., Open all of the presents. If you get any fruit that does not normally grow on trees, bury it. It will grow into a tree that produces the fruit you buried.,,
