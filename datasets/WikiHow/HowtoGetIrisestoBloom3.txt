@summary
look out for fertilizers that will not promote blooms.

@summary

@summary
do not sprinkle the fertilizer on the rhizomes as it can damage them.

@summary
consider using a slow release formula.
@article
 High-nitrogen fertilizers like those used to fertilize grass encourage only green leafy growth. They do not encourage flowering., This means that the fertilizer should contain 5% nitrogen, 10% phosphate, and 10% potash.Plan to use about Â¼ pound of fertilizer per 25 square feet.
 Instead, sprinkle the fertilizer around the outside of the main clump of rhizomes. Water the plant to help mix it into the soil.
 A 6-month slow-release formula can be used if preferred. If a slow-release formula fertilizer is not used, reblooming irises should be fed fertilizer again immediately after they bloom in the spring.
