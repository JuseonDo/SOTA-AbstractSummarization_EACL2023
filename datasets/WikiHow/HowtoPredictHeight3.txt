Released in 2005,this method utilizes the child’s sex, date of birth, date of test, height, sitting height, and weight.
There are online calculators for this method as well.
For example, a female child born May 5, 2003; tested May 5, 2015; height 63 inches; sitting height 49 inches; weight 120 pounds; can expect to reach 64.7 inches (5’5”).
 Even these methods used on teenagers who are nearing their final heights retain a margin of error. There are so many factors in final height that no prediction method can be entirely accurate. Growth spurts vary in occurrence and duration, environmental factors can change, and so on. The only way to know for sure is to wait and see.
