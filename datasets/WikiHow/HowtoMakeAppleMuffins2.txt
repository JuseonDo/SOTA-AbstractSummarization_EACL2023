, Save the remaining ¾ cup (150 grams) of brown sugar for later., Set the flour mixture aside when you are done. You will be adding this into your wet ingredients later on. Having all of the flours mixed in together first will give you more consistent muffins., Keep whisking until the oil and sugar are evenly combined. If you can't find any canola oil, you can use another flavorless cooking oil, such as vegetable oil., Stir the mixture well with a whisk after each egg that you add. Keep whisking until the yolks break, and there are no more streaks., Make sure that you are using plain, unsweetened applesauce. If you used the flavored kind, your apple muffins may turn out too sweet!, Whisk in half of the flour mixture, then half of the buttermilk. Whisk in the rest of the flour mixture, and then the rest of the buttermilk. This will prevent things from clumping up too much., If you have not yet done so, peel, core, and cut the apple into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) chunks. Gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often to ensure that the apple chunks mix in evenly., A quick and easy way to do this is with a large spoon or an ice cream scoop; this also ensures that each cup gets the same amount of batter., When you are done, gently tap the pan a few times against your counter. This will bring any air bubbles to the surface of the muffins., They are done when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean., Let them cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes in the pan first. Then, run a butter knife around the muffins, and gently pull them out of the tin. Let the muffins finish cooling on the rack.
