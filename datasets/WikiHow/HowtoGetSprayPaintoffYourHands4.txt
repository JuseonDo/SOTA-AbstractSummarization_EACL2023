if you're having trouble removing spray paint from your hands using the above method alone, try using an abrasive like salt or sugar along with the baking soda mixture.

 Mix together roughly equal parts baking soda and water (err on the side of more baking soda). Pour baking soda mixture over hands and thoroughly work into spots where spray paint has dried. After a minute or so of rubbing hands together, the spray paint should come off quite easily.
 While salt and sugar are both desiccants (meaning that they'll sap moisture from your skin), they shouldn't be too rough on your skin in the end.
