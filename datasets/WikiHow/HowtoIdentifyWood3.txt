 You can cut up to five samples of different woods each year that can be processed for free. Ensure each specimen is at least one by three by six inches (2.5 by 7.5 by 15 cm) in size.
 Place them in individual envelopes. Use letters one through five to label the samples, and then write a list of the samples for your records.
 This organization provides five identifications per year to US citizens. It will not provide identification for legal disputes.
 Send it to “Center for Wood Anatomy Research, USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, One Gifford Pinchot Dr., Madison, WI 53726-2398.”, If you need wood identified more quickly, you may be able to contact a local carpenter or wood-worker for a consultation.
