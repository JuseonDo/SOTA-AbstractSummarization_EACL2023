@summary
place your bass drum on the floor with the head on top.

@summary
figure out where you want your hole.

@summary
decide what size you would like.

@summary
take off the label on the can and place the top edge of the empty can down on an electric stove to heat it up.

@summary
once your can is hot enough, about 20-30 seconds on high on the electric stove, grab the can with the mitts and slowly place the hot edge on the bass drum head.

@summary
slowly pull out the can trying not to bump the side of the head as the can may be very hot.

 The side the beater hits should be closer to the ground.;
, In the center, the beat will be the tightest as the air can escape the drum faster this way. Placing it off to the side gives more of a fatter sound; it depends on what you desire.
 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) is recommended. Find a metal can with the same diameter (any can will work, soup, coffee, etc.).
 If you have a gas stove, try using a torch to heat up the edge of the can (this is far more dangerous and is not really recommended). You will have to get oven mitts to hold the can to prevent burning of your fingers as the can will get a bit hot.
 If your can is hot enough, it will cut through your head like butter leaving a nice even edge on the head.
 The circle piece you just cut should be somewhere in the bass drum; pull it out and throw it away.
