 Take a paper towel or washcloth and remove all that you can by blotting at the stain. You may need more than one towel to do this thoroughly.
 There are many cleaning solutions designed specifically for removing pet waste from carpets, so look for one of these. Spray the solution onto the stain directly., You should let the solution sit for at least 5 minutes, so that it has time to soak into the carpetâ€™s fibers and remove the stain., After giving it time to soak, rinse the spot by blotting it with a water-soaked towel. Then, dab it dry it with a clean paper towel or washcloth.
