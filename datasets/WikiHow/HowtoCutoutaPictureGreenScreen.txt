 This is best done if the contrast between object and background is high; this makes it easier to trace the edge of the object later.;
,, You should notice both of the small "selected color" boxes go green.
 Start with the areas that you can easily remove. Select areas of the background and delete them. You will notice they go green as you do this.
 Now to look a little closer. On the tool-bar click the zoom tool (magnifying glass) and on the box below click 2X. The image will double in size.
 Work carefully. If you chop out a bit by accident, press "Ctrl + Z" to undo the last change.
 Scroll along until you see the top of the image.
 Select the second thickest line from the box below.
 If you haven't had much practice at this before, it really does help to have a high contrast. Start to draw around the outline, taking off the squares where it is dark. Use short lines where more detail is required, and don't try to get everything with this tool yet. The image will start to look "messy" at this point, but don't worry. It's temporary.
 Drag the line (straight) across the curve. Now bend the line around the curve.


If you get the curve wrong, don't try to adjust it. Hitting "Ctrl + Z" will undo the line, allowing you to try again.
 Select the eraser tool when you've gone around the entire object. By default, the box below should have selected the second-largest eraser. If not, select it.
, Zoom into them and use the pencil tool to edit the image pixel-by-pixel if necessary.
, Click anywhere on the green background to change the background color. You're done!
