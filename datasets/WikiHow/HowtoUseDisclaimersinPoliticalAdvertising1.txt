Check with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on what constitutes public communications. Always included are television, Internet or radio ads, print ads in newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising such as billboards or yard signs, mass mailings, emails and websites available to the public.;
, Candidates, individuals, and political action committees must disclose who is paying for any ads that ask for donations.
 For example, if you are handing out pencils supporting a particular candidate, there may not be enough space for a disclaimer.
 If you are in doubt about whether a disclaimer is needed, it probably is.
