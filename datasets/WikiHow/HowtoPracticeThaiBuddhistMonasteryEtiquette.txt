 Showy clothing is not appropriate. In Thai culture, black is a funeral colour, so dressing in all black is not advised. Long shirts and long skirts or long trousers in plain colours are recommended, especially in higher-ranking or stricter temples. Other places may be slightly more relaxed, and you may even see Thais wearing shorts, but modesty is still appreciated.;
, Showy jewelry or other overt displays of wealth are unacceptable.
, Don't be surprised if your shoes are 'borrowed' at a larger monastery with many entrances...just wait patiently and they will be returned.
, If a woman must offer something to a monk, do not hand it directly to him. Put it down somewhere he can pick it up. An offering cloth may be used for this purpose in Thailand, however, in Thai monasteries outside of Thailand, the use of an offering cloth is not as common.



The person in the highest position is the most respected. If a monk is seated, try not to stand/walk past with your head above him. This can be done by shuffling while kneeling if you need to move.
Do not walk in front of people who are bowing.
Do not step on the threshold.
 This gesture of respect is called a "wai". The monk will not return this gesture. He is not being impolite, just accepting your respect.
,,,, Don't make a lot of noise or run about.
