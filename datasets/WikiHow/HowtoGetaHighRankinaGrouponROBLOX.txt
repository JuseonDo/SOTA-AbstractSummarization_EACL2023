@article
 One to two hundred members should do it.;
, Participate in raids, trainings, and group events. Hopefully somebody will notice that you come on a lot and will point this out to the leader.
 Use good grammar and spelling, and be mature and diplomatic. Again, hopefully people will notice and realize how active you are.
 This increases your skill and may even help with promotion.
 Ask your friends if they would consider joining the group. You could also go to games where the theme is similar to that of the group. For example: If you're in a war group you might want to visit "The Underground War" or "Armored Patrol". Also try being friendly and give promotion requests for people to like you, but don't do this often, then the HR's will suspect something., This demonstrates that you have strong potential in terms of becoming a High Rank.
 People will get angry with you and you might get exiled from the group.
 This will show that you have good listening skills and can respect others.
 This will boost your popularity.
, If leaders of other groups see you already have a good active group, they might promote you.
 They usually consist of the things you have learned in training, such as fighting and obstacles. Sometimes they include a record of your past experiences and how you tend to deal with challenges. There might be another test to see if you have proper spelling and grammar. Finally, they usually have you host a training to see how you can handle situations and go about helping people, and giving promotions.
, That can be another test, consisting of a more difficult obstacle and sword/gun fight. There is sometimes even an election for the highest ranks. This will be a test of how much the community likes you, and could possibly lead to you owning the group.
