 Generally speaking this is the best stages of moving with children as they tend to make the moving transition quite well. In the final weeks before the move they will often pick up on the stress and anxiety levels and could become fussy and demanding.;
, Give yourself more time to pack, to accommodate interruptions with child care needs. Your child may need more attention than usual and it is common for your toddler or infant to demand it with bad behavior or needy cries.



Ask a a family member help out with child care.
Try packing during nap times or at night while they sleep.



Set enough time aside to play with and show love to your child.
Keep their favorite security items (stuffed animals, blankets, etc.) unpacked and ready at hand.
