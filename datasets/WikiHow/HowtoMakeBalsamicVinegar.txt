 These types of barrels are found in stores that cater to wine making.


The wood of the barrel can be mulberry, chestnut, oak or cherry. Choose one of these wood types based on the desired flavor of the vinegar. You can use multiple woods.
Choose a mulberry barrel for a spicy aroma and bolder taste.
Choose an oak barrel to keep the vinegar thicker, as oak permits less evaporation.
Choose a chestnut barrel for a rich brownish red color.
Choose a cherry wood barrel for a sweeter final taste.;
, Use a mixture of vinegar, salt and water to eliminate bacteria and impurities.



These are white grapes grown mostly in the Modena region of Italy, but they can be grown elsewhere if weather permits. These grapes are harvested at the end of fall. Buy enough grapes so 80 percent of each barrel can be filled with liquid.
 P them through a sieve.
,, Let it simmer at 190 degrees Fahrenheit (87.7 degrees Celsius) for 24 hours. Do not exceed 195 degrees or your mosto will not ferment in the next stage.


The process of long simmering the juice reduces it to half of its original volume and creates a mosto, which in English is "must." This is very sweet syrup.
 Let it sit for several hours.
, This allows evaporation and reduction of the liquid.
, Repeat the filling process until you reach the largest barrel.

This is not yet authentic balsamic vinegar, but it is a form of vinegar.
