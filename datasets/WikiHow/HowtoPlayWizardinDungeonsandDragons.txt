choose the right stats.

@summary
prepare your spells carefully: wizards are highly limited in their volume of spells compared to all other classes.

@summary
expand your spellbook: unlike sorcerers, wizards can know an unlimited number of spells, as long as they have enough spellbooks.

@summary
cast spells cautiously: the wizard who casts spells at every opportunity is the wizard who dies first.

@summary
use scrolls liberally: scrolls are probably the best items in the game for wizards except for staffs.

@summary
craft magic items: one advantage wizards have over sorcerers is that they are much better suited to crafting magic items.

@summary
have mundane items: if you are out of spells, you will need to fight with hands.

 Choose a race with an Intelligence bonus. In 3.5, elves and humans take control while eladrins are more useful in 4e. A high intelligence score is compulsory for a wizard because that ability governs his spell casting.;
, Intelligence ranks first for a wizard, then Dexterity/Constitution, then Wisdom, then Strength and lastly Charisma.
 Choose the spells you think you will need most. For example, if you are going to raid a goblin's fortress, preparing a magic missile is probably a better idea than comprehend languages, unless you plan on interrogating the evil goblin chieftain, who only speaks Goblin.
 If the Arch-Mage of Bellfield, or whoever, is in town, you might ask him/her to allow you to copy some spells from their spellbook. They might charge you a fee, but most wizards, especially those of a higher level than you, will be happy to allow you to.
 If you're going against just one opponent, fireball isn't the best spell. Sometimes you might just not cast a spell at all. Having a crossbow to assist your companions is a great way to refrain from spell casting while still feeling as though you are in the game.
 Without expending a spell slot, you can cast any spell on the scroll as long as it is of a level you can cast. Even if the scroll is above the highest level you can cast on your own you still may be able to use it. You must make a caster level check with a Difficulty Class (DC) of the scroll's caster level +1. This helps conserve spell slots, and they're pretty cheap.
 For one, their near unlimited selection of spells means that almost no magic item is out of reach of the high-level wizard to craft. And even low-level wizards can craft magic items. Wizards get Scribe Scroll as an automatic feat at first level.
 So have a quarterstaff, a dagger and maybe a crossbow with you. These items can also be use out of combat. How can you cut ropes without daggers, or measure water without a quarterstaff?
