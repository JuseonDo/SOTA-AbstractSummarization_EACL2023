 Set them down on a clean area of the floor.
 This will help free any debris that has remained trapped in the folds of the suede.


If available, use the specialized upholstery attachment that was included with your vacuum-- this attachment does not have the rougher and--presumably--dirtier edges of the other attachments. Consult your vacuum's manual if you're unsure which attachment this is.
Vacuuming keeps the nap intact and will also remove dust and debris that has managed to build-up on the surface of the couch.
 Begin with the arms and work your way down toward the legs.
 This will polish and restore the luster of the couch.
 Be sure to polish both the top and bottom of the cushion, as well as all of the sides to eliminate any lingering debris or pet dander.
 Again, if appropriate, rotating the cushions to even out wear-and-tear.
