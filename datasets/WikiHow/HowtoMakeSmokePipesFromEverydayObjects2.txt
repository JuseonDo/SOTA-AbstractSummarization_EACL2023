look for correct crater size.

add the draw tube.

attach the screen maintenance pin.

choomette option: as with socket-wrench one-hitter, above, drill an end-to-end tunnel through a 4-inch (10-cm)-long wood piece with one (top) end the right width so that the screened hose nipple fits tightly in it, and the other (butt) end the right width so that at least a half-inch of the flexible drawtube fits tightly in it.

 The best cylindrical crater diameters readily available include 7/32 inch (5.5-mm), 6-mm and 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) inner-diameter of nipple.

If the nipple you have found is wider than that, insert a snug-fitting metal (usually brass) tube-segment to narrow it down.
If your nipple is narrower than the above diameters, use a variable-speed drill at slow speed to drill it open to the correct width and depth of crater as shown in the diagram above.
 Attach a flexible long draw tube that fits snugly over the barbed tail end of the hose nipple. You can stretch the outermost half inch of the hose with needle-nose pliers, making it easier to slip the hose over the end of the barbed brass stem., To the barbed shank of hose nipple, tightly wind a 5-inch wire braid and attach a safety pin.,
