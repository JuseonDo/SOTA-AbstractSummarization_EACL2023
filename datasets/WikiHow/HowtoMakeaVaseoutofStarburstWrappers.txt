 You really only need to go shopping for Starbursts at the candy section in any grocery store. Everything else is usually laying around the house. So basically, here are your ingredients: About one bag of Starbursts, a clean empty jar, white liquid glue, like Elmer's (not a glue stick), water, and a paintbrush.
 This project does involve a lot of glue so it would be a good idea to put newspaper down on the surface you're working on., It is best to unwrap them as you need them to avoid being wasteful.

Put the Starbursts in an airtight bag so you do not waste the candy. Or you can do the preferred method where you eat the candy as you go along!

, Get the paintbrush and dip it in the glue. Brush the back of the Starburst wrapper, covering all the corners. Then place the Starburst wrapper on the jar. You can put on the Starburst wrappers in any way, so they're overlapping, next to each other, or any other way.,, This is very important before you go on to the next step., This should be about one part glue and one part water. You may have to alter this so it's not too thin or thick., Once you've done so the project will look like a horrible mess, but it will look better because the glue does dry clear. When it does dry, paint another coat on. You will be repeating these two steps about five times until the final coat dries., This vase can hold pencils, flowers or anything else. This is also just good for decoration. Remember you can do this with just about anything you want to do with it, not just a vase or jar.
