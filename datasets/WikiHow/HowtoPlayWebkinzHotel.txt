 To start with, try having three rooms: the pool, the lobby, and your Webkinz's hotel room. Create "walls" with pillows, blankets, books, etc.
 Make sure to have towels, a swimsuit for your Webkinz, shampoo, toys, and a chair.
 Set up comfortable places for other stuffed animals to sit on and have some nice decorations. Bring in some snacks and drinks for the stuffed animals and yourself if your parents let you.
 When you welcome a Webkinz, note their name, any other Webkinz staying in the room, and how long they're staying.
