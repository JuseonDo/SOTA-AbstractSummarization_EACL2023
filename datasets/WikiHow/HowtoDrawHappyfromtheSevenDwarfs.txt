 All seven dwarves' heads are very round, like basketballs--look at the illustration to get it exactly right.;
, This will be the upper part of the body.
 This will be the lower part of the body.
 These will be Happy's arms and hands.
 The feet ovals should be longer than the others, so take that detail into account.
 Make a chubby face with big eyes, bushy eyebrows, a big nose, and an open, smiling mouth. Put a cap over the head and a ruffled beard under his face.
 Draw a tunic over a chubby belly, secured with a buckled belt, as well as lumpy shoes on his feet.

 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Erase any leftover pencil and add color!
