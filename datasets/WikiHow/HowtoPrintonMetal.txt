@summary
ensure you have an inkjet printer.

@summary
fill the printer with a good amount of ink.

@summary
,

@summary
purchase flexible aluminum flashing.

@summary
choose the side you want to print on.

@summary
sand the surface with an orbital saw.

@summary
clean the surface with a bleach cleaning product, such as a whitening sponge or mr. clean.

@summary
take the flashing inside.

@summary
purchase and use an inkjet pre-coating product, such as dass pre-coat.

@summary
apply a thick bead of pre-coat above the sheet of metal flashing.

@summary
use a pre-made coating bar.

@summary
place the coating bar above the pre-coat and slide it down over the entire metal piece to coat it evenly.

@summary
don’t touch the surface once you apply the pre-coat.

@summary
get your image ready to print.

@summary
apply double sided tape to a piece of carrier paper the same size as your metal print.

@summary
load the carrier sheet and metal into the feeder tray.

@summary
allow the metal to move through the printer.

@summary
consider sealing the print in a few hours.

@summary
opt to use another method if your printer won’t print on flashing.

@summary
load the transfers into the printer.

@summary
go through the process of abrading your metal flashing, so that the waterproof surface is removed.

@summary
,

@summary
apply the transfer very carefully to the metal.

@summary
allow it to dry and coat it if recommend it.

 For this project, the wider the printer and the more flexible the feed, the better. If it has problems printing thick cardstock or stickers, it is unlikely to work.;
,, Your goal is for the flashing to be thin. Cut it to size with a wire cutter or strong scissors.


Ensure the size is less than maximum size on your printer feed.
 Take the flashing outside and lay the printing surface face up.
 You want to abrade the coating on the outside of the flashing. Use a medium to fine sandpaper and cover every inch with your sanding pad.
 The waterproof surface should now be removed, so that ink can be applied.
 Apply a large piece of double-sided tape and tape it to a waterproof work surface.
 You will need an even layer on the top of your flashing before printing.
 It should be pooled above it so that you can coat it evenly with a coating bar.
 It can be wood or plastic, but it is similar to a screen-printing technique.
 If it doesn’t coat your metal and the surface is flat, you haven’t used enough pre-coat.
 Pick it up from the sides until the tape comes loose.
 Make sure to size it ahead of time and test it. Place your feeder tray bars in the right position for even printing.
 Press the flashing down onto it, with the printing side up.
 Press print. If your printer will not print on metal, you will need to opt for the next part, which is using an inkjet transfer.
 Let it sit for a few moments. Then, remove it by the sides and let it sit and dry completely.
 The ink is secure, but not very durable at this point.
 Purchase some inkjet transfer sheets that will work on metal. Sheets like Lazertran say they will print onto any material., Print them according to the instructions.
, It may take some assistance or practice to apply it flush with the edges.
 You can now hang or frame your metal print.
