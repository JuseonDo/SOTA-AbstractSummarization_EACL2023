 Yes it's bold and daring to say but think about it â€“ it's just a soccer game and it's not the end of the world if your favorite soccer team loses a game that only happens every four years.;
, If they played badly, it's only natural that they lost!

, They got that far so, they are not that terrible.
 Don't get too down, think happy thoughts, and think about how your team has won many matches before and will do so again.
 There are much worse things in life than your favorite team losing a game.
 This will boost your mood and support for your country's team.
 Maybe your country has had more luck this year playing tennis, performing athletics, or cycling, etc.
 Don't think about the loss constantly. Think about something else to distract yourself, such as your upcoming vacation, the new car you have just bought, etc.
