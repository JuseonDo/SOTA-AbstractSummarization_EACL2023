 If you mix Burton bindings (3x3 holes), with a non-Burton snowboard (4x4 holes) you may need a special plate that comes in the box with Burton bindings. Burton uses a 3-hole pattern, while other brands use a 4 hole pattern. The plate will make sure your gear will mount correctly.

, Typically, you will want to have your feet shoulder width apart. For the average male, this is around 1/3 of your height or 20 inches (51 cm).
 This wikiHow assumes you are using a standard, regular stance.
 Locate them your measured stance width apart. While most people will want the bindings centered, you may modify this as you see fit.









On a powder day, you may want to move your bindings back towards your rear foot so that your nose tilts slightly up allowing you to float above the powder without needing to lean back.
 For example, if you are riding regular (i.e. right foot in back), you can set the front (left foot) binding facing forward to an angle usually 15-20 degrees. The rear (right foot) binding is usually set to 0 degrees.
 Tighten the screws. Return to tighten all the screws again. Loose screws will give you a hard time or even cause an accident.
 In order to do so, you have to play with the tab at the base of your binding. While there is no rule how to set this, forward leans of 10-15 degrees are common. Use trial and error to find an angle comfortable for your knee and that still lets let you bend enough to keep your balance.
 Check your straps for safety. Tighten your straps to ensure that your boots don't move. The goal is to tighten the straps as much as possible without constricting your blood or hurting your feet. You are now ready to ride.
