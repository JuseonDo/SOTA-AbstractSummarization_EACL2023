 Throw the yolk away. Use as many eggs as desired. If you have pets, mix the yolks with their food. They'll love it!;
, Turn the oven to 6-7. When the pan gets hot enough, spread the butter and canola oil.
 Have a desired amount of black pepper, a dash complete seasoning, and throw in pieces of provolone cheese, that fit the amounts of egg whites that you originally added.
, When they're cooked, chop them up.
