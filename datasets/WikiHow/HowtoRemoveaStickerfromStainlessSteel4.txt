 Make sure to wipe the entirety of the surface to remove the olive oil. You’ll find that using distilled white vinegar will also work great for general cleaning and polishing of stainless steel., For this step, you should soak the cloth thoroughly. The water will allow you to clean any remaining oil or vinegar. Wipe with the “grain” of the stainless steel.
 Make sure not to leave any water on the stainless steel, as it may leave marks.
