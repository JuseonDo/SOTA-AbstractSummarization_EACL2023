 Uber and Lyft’s pricing options differ depending on time of day, length of commute, and other factors, so be sure to look into that before deciding if this is the best option for you. You should also check to make sure you are in an area where Uber / Lyft drop-offs and pickups are allowed. Uber Pool is another option for cheaper rides, so long as you don’t mind sharing your car with other commuters., This can be an especially viable option if you live close to someone you also work with., You can look up designated bicycle paths ahead of time to plan the safest and most efficient route.
