 This is the app with a white ghost on a yellow background.;
, It’s in the upper-right corner of the screen. This will switch you to the front camera and is indicated by a smiley face with arrows encircling it.


If you were in front camera mode last time you used Snapchat, you may not need to do anything.
 This will be at the top of the screen with the camera icon. Flash is on when the lightning bolt does not have an “x” beside it.
 Tap the large, circular camera button towards the bottom of the screen to capture a selfie even if it's dark.


Some versions of Snapchat may require you to go into Settings to enable this feature. Go to Manage Preferences and check Front-facing Flash.
