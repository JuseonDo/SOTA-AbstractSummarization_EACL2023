 If they pull your hair, do it back. That will bother them.
 If they charge at you, block their attack!

, Wake him/her up early by throwing a large pillow at him/her and keep on throwing it at him even if he/she is awake.
 When his or her friends are over, tell them embarrassing things about your sibling.
 This is especially good if your sibling has done this to you.
