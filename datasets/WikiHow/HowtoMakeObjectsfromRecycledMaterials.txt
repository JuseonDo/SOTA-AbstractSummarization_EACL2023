tear all the paper into small pieces and put it a bucket or a pot.

leave it there overnight for proper paper absorption.

stir the soaked paper with a wooden stick or spatula.

@summary
drain most of the water.

@summary
after that, add the wheat flour.

continue stirring until it becomes a smooth dough.

now, using the paper dough, you can start covering the box, bottle or whatever you chose to work with.

leave it under the sun or in the driest place possible.

@summary
once it’s completely dried, it’s time to paint it!

 Is it a utensil for the kitchen; is it a flower vase, or something else? Using this simple method, and using a proper framework, it’s even possible to make furniture!


For example, to make a container with a lid, we can use some egg cartons and an oatmeal box. Their packages are all made of paper and we produce a great deal of garbage when we throw them away. So, instead of increasing our garbage, we can collect it for a couple of weeks and create something useful, some piece of art that could be interesting to look at, or even both at the same time.

,,,, You might find it better to use your hands to do that. After a few minutes mixing the paper with the water, it will turn into “liquid” paper.
 You may use a sieve if you prefer.
 One or two cups of flour should be enough for a small amount of paper such as a supermarket plastic bag full of torn paper.
 Drain away some more water if necessary.
 You only need to add a layer of one or two centimeters. Make sure that you press the dough against the container well enough so that it doesn’t peel off.
 Depending on the weather conditions it may take from one day to one week to completely dry it. If you have an oven you may want to put it in there for about 30 minutes at a very low temperature. If you do this make sure your art craft is on the middle or highest shelf to prevent burning your work.
 Feel free to paint it the way you like it. You may also add a second layer of paint once the first one is dried to make sure the paint will completely cover the entire object and prevent it from peeling off easily after some time.
