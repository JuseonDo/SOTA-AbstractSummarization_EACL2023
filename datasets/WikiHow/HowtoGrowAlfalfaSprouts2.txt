 Measure out 1 tablespoon of seeds, which will yield 1 1/2 cups of alfalfa. Store the unused seeds in a resealable plastic container or in their original bag.
 Place them in a fine-mesh strainer or a piece of cheesecloth and rinse them thoroughly. Sort through the seeds and remove any damaged or discolored seeds.
 Place the seeds in a glass jar. Cover the seeds with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of cold water. Cover the jar with a piece of cheesecloth secured with a rubber band. Place the seeds in a dark room and soak them for at least 12 hours.
 Pour the water through the cheesecloth, which will trap the seeds inside the jar and keep them from spilling down the sink.
 The type of tray that comes with a red terra cotta growing pot is perfect for this purpose. Spoon the seeds inside the tray and spread them out so that the evenly coat the tray.
 Choose a pan that's bigger than the tray, and set the tray inside the pan. Fill the pan with water so that it rises about halfway up the sides of the tray. Don't add so much water that it spills into the tray.


Place the tray and pan in a dark room to allow the seeds to sprout.
This method works because the clay tray will absorb water from the pan - just enough to moisten the seeds enough to help them grow. With this method, no rinsing is required.
 Check on it every and fill it when the water evaporates. The clay tray will continue absorbing water and keeping the seeds moist, helping them to sprout.
 Put it in a sunny window for about 15 minutes. They're ready to eat when they're bright green.
