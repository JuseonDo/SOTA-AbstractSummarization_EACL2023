 Prioritize your poems to how you’d like to see them on the runner. You may want to photocopy the poems so you have easy access to them while you write (rather than having to flip back and forth through books).
 Determine how you’d like to see the poems written on the runner. Practice your writing/lettering on a separate sheet of paper, using your paint pens.
 Lay the runner out in a wide, open space. Make sure the area is clear of pets or small children.


Measure out guidelines with the yardstick. Make light markings with your pencil so they are only visible to you when you get close to the runner.
Determine where on the runner you will begin with the poems (toward the pulpit or the back of the room).
 Try to remain consistent with handwriting style and word size.
 Allow up to 24 hours to dry (so don’t do this the night before the wedding).
