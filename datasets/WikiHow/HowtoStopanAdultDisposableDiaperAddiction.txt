 Be open to other ideas. Diapers aren't the complete answer to every problem faced, but will commonly be used to cover up the real underlying problem.;
, Talk with the group and tell them (either privately or during the meeting) about your problem.

Not only will the wearer refuse to keep wearing a cloth diaper after their first use, but it will also require more than themselves to do, and after firing the caregiver, a cloth diaper change would be harder for the wearer to change themselves. If they don't get a diaper rash within the first two weeks while wearing the disposable diapers, the cloth will cause them great discomfort and cause them to give up their addiction to their diapers.
 You might get a bit emotional during this time, but you'll understand later that doing is will be for your own good.
 It's not easy to see something you've grown attached to, being lost or given away to some other place other than your residence especially when done for good measure. (Whether that measure was medical, emotional, or physical, this "breakup" is "hard to do".).
 Read a magazine or book, use the Internet during these times, or put together a model of some sort. Find something that can take your mind off your problem (of not wearing the diaper anymore).
 Urinating more often may lessen the amount of "trickle-points" and may make you not need to unconsciously urinate where and when no one else is around.
 Wear a bedwetting alarm that will beep and make a loud noise when it feels urine starting to trickle out, especially after the first few nights of not wearing the diaper.
 Although not many nursing homes may need or want your remaining diapers, you may contact them and tell them that they are unused and can be used on their residents, and that you would be willing to give the unused ones to them.
