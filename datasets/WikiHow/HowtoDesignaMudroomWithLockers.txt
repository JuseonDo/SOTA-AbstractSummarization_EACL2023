,, It's a great place for storing mail and the inevitable "junk drawer". You can also add electric in the drawers so phones/iPods can be charged out of sight!

,, This protects the walls and gives it a true mudroom look. This beadboard was about 6' high with a 1x4 trim piece at the top. Add hooks to the trim piece for coats/pet supplies!

, This comfy spot was finished off with beadboard and a painted seat with cushions.
 A durable floor that is easily cleanable is a key component to this space. Use your imagination when picking tile. Choose a nice light color, then make a tile "rug" with a mosaic border and tiles on the diagonal inside the border.
 Attach tin squares to a thin piece of plywood then nail it to the beams in the ceiling. A little chair rail border around the edges, and you have a beautiful ceiling treatment!

, Choose a warm color that highlights the tones of your tile.
