@article
 you don't want the cheese to become so warm that it starts to melt and "sweat."Take hard cheeses, such as Cheddar, out of the fridge an hour to an hour and a half before serving/eating.
Take soft, creamy cheeses, such as Brie, out of the fridge two to three hours before serving/eating.
Take fresh cheeses, such as cottage cheese, out of the fridge 30 minutes before serving/eating.;
, The rind is usually hard and waxy. Examples of cheeses where you should peel/cut the rind off include: Cheddar, Gruyere, and Romano.
 This rind is usually soft and white. Examples of cheeses where you can eat the rind include Camembert and Brie.
 Just don't make a huge show of it. Smelling is a big part of tasting. It can actually help intensify the taste of the cheese.
 When you smoosh cheese onto bread or crackers, you tamper with the unique flavor of the cheese. If you really want to appreciate the taste of the cheese, eat it alone., In general, soft, creamy cheeses are milder than hard ones. If you are unsure which cheese is mild and which cheese is sharp, ask the host.If you start out with a sharp cheese, your taste buds will be overwhelmed, and you might miss out on the underlying flavors of any mild cheese you eat afterwards.
Make sure that you use a different knife for different types of cheese to that you don't mix flavors.
