 You can purchase the Chromecast stick from Amazon for around $30. The pertinent app--also entitled "Chromecast"--is free to download from the Google Play Store on your phone., It should fit into your TV's HDMI port.You'll also need to plug the included Chromecast power cable into both the back of the unit and the USB charger brick (which should be plugged into an electrical socket).
,,, These should be in the Settings app.,,,,, This includes the following processes:

Selecting a country
Adding a name to your Chromecast (optional)
Adding a wireless network to your Chromecast

, Netflix and YouTube both fit this criterion., This is the rectangular icon with a series of curving lines in its bottom left corner., If you gave your Chromecast a name, that name will display here instead., This may take a few seconds. Once your screen has been successfully mirrored, you can use your phone to pause, skip ahead, or alter the volume of your content.

You can also lock your phone while casting if you want to preserve battery life.
