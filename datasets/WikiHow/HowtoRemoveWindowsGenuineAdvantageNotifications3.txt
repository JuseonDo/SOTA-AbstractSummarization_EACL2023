,,, As a precaution, after you have followed the above instructions:


Go to Control Panel > Security Center > Automatic Update Settings.
Select the third option, “Notify me but don’t automatically download or install them."
Click OK.
The next time the “Windows Updates” icon appears in the system tray, click on the icon and it will display a list of available updates. Windows won’t automatically download and install them anymore.
If “Windows Genuine Advantage Notification Tool” is there, uncheck it and press enter to download everything else (if you want to). You can right-click to “hide updates” that you don’t want.
Select “Don’t notify me about these updates again”, so that they will be ignored every time updates are downloaded.
Just remember, from now on, make sure to check the list of downloads so that you don’t install any new versions of this “tool”.
