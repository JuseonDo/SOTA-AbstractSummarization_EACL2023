@summary
use the hunter (military helicopter) or rhino (tank) if possible.

@summary
for the hpv-1000 (police motorcycle,) get a lot of ammo, and concentrate on keeping your distance from the cars.

@summary
keep shooting the car until it blows up.

@summary
use body armor, snacks / food, and police bribes to make it easier.

@summary
optional: an excellent trick for the hpv-1000, ranger, or police car, is to use the mini-gun.

@summary
do them in angel pine.

@summary
if you stay close enough to the main pack, you can shoot them with the sniper rifle at the end of the race (*before* cj finishes it,) and it will move cj into first place.if there's a corona on the other side of the arena, just wait for a closer one to appear.

@summary
release the accelerator to make quicker turns than your opponents.if you have to, ram through some cars to get to a corona nearby.

@summary
if possible, use the train tracks to get to your destination.

@summary
when not on the train tracks, try to stay off-road as much as possible.lean forward as much as possible to gain as much speed as possible.

@summary
hit the ramp, and before you land, lean the bike slightly forward, so the front wheel touches the ground first.

 Those are hands down the easiest way of doing the vigilante missions., If CJ's weapon skill is high, he probably has better range than them, so you can hang back and shoot them., That will hopefully get rid of all the criminals quickly. If you have to, while shooting and finishing off the vehicle, honk the horn , to keep cops on foot from approaching the bike. Honking the horn works on all pedestrians and cops, but not enemy gang members. Also don't let them approach too closely, because they could still knock CJ off the bike., Try to keep CJ's wanted level down to 2 stars or lower. And be extra careful on levels 10 through 12, because the shotguns can do a lot of damage., This blows up cars tremendously quickly. So drive to where you can get a quick shot on the cars, jump out, and fire away. The mini-gun is difficult to come by though at the beginning of the game. (It's in Las Venturas.), It's very easy there. Also, Fort Carson may work., This does not work with all weapons.,, This also tends to throw off their aiming.,, It is so much easier like that. If you go through Los Santos, stay as far away from the roadblocks as possible, while going full speed. And if you go through the desert, be careful to not jack knife the truck when going downhill in the tunnel., Obviously use your judgment; don't drive on rain-soaked grass on a hillside. Plan your route out carefully, so you don't have to backtrack or try to make a U-turn.,, If the front wheel touches the ground slightly before the back wheel, and you've gone far enough (i.e. right before where you stop,) the game will count it as a stoppie, making an easy gold.
