get good foot position.

@summary
your front foot should be right on the bolts.

@summary
now put a slight amount of pressure on the tail while lifting your front foot with the board underneath touching it firmly.

@summary
lean your upper torso more so forward than our hips and legs and shift your weight forward when it is needed, as gravity will being pulling you backwards, but also you can shift back if too much weight if shifted.

@summary
then when you are done, or cannot hold the trick any longer just let push back down and roll away like usual.

@article
 Have the edge of your back foot nicely lined up with the tail, but with your shoe still completely on the board except your heel. As this is all about balance and endurance, you will need to keep a proper stance throughout the entire manual.It will shift as your weight does and the ground surface changes depending on inclines or declines. Stay on the balls of your feet and your toes and strain them hard when you actually start the manual.;
, Others may prefer it at any other area of the nose of the board, but I believe you are widening your stance and allowing too much pressure on the nose if too far up, which could cause a wipe-out when you push down too hard if it is not taken back to the bolts quick enough. So I advise keeping the front foot on the bolts until you learn the manual better, then you can adapt it to your style.
 it should be pushing against your front foot quite hard from the pressure from your back foot. As you feel the balance between these 2 pressures you will also have to put your hands up and balance as well as you can, it will take a while to actually feel the balance and also be able to physically sustain that stance for the period the manual is performed.
 And you must find that 50/50 ratio of balance which is genuinely tricky to hold for long periods, especially without a decline.
