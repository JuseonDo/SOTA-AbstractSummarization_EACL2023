@summary
get out your calender.

@summary
prepare in advance.

@summary
before you start your day, plan where this is going to take place.

@summary
you may light some candles in the bathtub, but if there is a small window, open it a tiny bit so that there is some fresh air.

@summary
now lay the fluffy towel where it's easy to reach so you won't be cold, and your fresh comfy cloths (along with your hair tie so you can tie your hair into a high ponytail to get it out of your face) as well unless you have a robe you want to wear.

@summary
next, go buy some snacks and rent out a chick flick movie.

@summary
if you want, you can turn off your cell phone or page so that you won't be bothered.

@summary
now go and relax!

 Planning is essential to having a day to actually relax. This way, you can tell others not to bother you, and have a day off. Make sure you do not have anything else planned for this day, because this is a day for you! Mark your relaxing days ( once a month), so that you can take a break to keep yourself from feeling overwhelmed.;
, It would stink if you had to get out of your bath, then go to the video store because you forgot to get one. Make sure you have everything the day before!

, Living room or your own bedroom? Even though the TV is probably in the living room, you can use a computer or a laptop if you want to watch it on our own (without siblings bothering you). Then set up the movie in your area (on your bed or couch), so that all you have to do is click play, and make sure that if you're using a laptop, that it is charged up and put some nice aroma in the room your in as well. And get the nail polishing stuff too so that you can do your nails while watching the movie if you want.
 Then place the music near by, outside so you can hear it unless what you have is completely waterproof.
 And get the cream too so that you can put it in after you take that relaxing bath. You may put the face mask on while you're in the tub, reading a magazine afterwards, or during the movie, I recommend Devil Wears Prada, but if you're going to watch it, get the veggies with dip so that you won't feel guilty while you're diving into that tub of ice cream, but instead feel healthier and happy.
