@summary
first draw the shape and size you want the base of the hill to be on one piece of card, then cut it out.

@summary
on another piece draw the shape again but smaller and cut this out.

@summary
now stack all the bits together on top of each other largest to smallest.

@summary
using tissue paper (kitchen roll is good but newspaper will do) you want to give the sloop of the hill some texture.

@summary
while this is still wet with the glue apply some more glue to the rest of the hill and sprinkle with sand, shake off excess and leave to dry.

@summary
now you can paint it, an undercoat will help keep the sand glued down but is not essential.

@summary
and hay presto.

, Repeat a couple of times.(see Tips)

, If you are happy with the size and height glue them down.
 Glue around the sides of the hill and apply the tissue paper and glue over the top (watered down PVA glue is best for this) you want to cover all the side so you can’t tell its corrugated cardboard underneath. To make it more realistic (well as realistic a cardboard hill can be) don’t do it all the same put bumps and clumps in random places.
, Paint the whole thing what colours you feel to make it as life like as possible normally I would do an undercoat of dark green and dry brush with a brown so it sticks to the tops of the sand and throw in some light greens for shading.
 You have a hill with a flat surface to put your archers/warmachines on to rain terror on the battlefield and it didn't cost you much, in fact if your lucky you can do it with stuff laying around the house/outbuildings so a nice hill that costs nothing.
