, Start by washing and rinsing your hair, then wet your washcloth (not a reusable sponge) and wash your face. This way your pores aren't open when you rinse your hair creating zits from soap.,, You can also tap a small amount of powder on your toes if you are active most days and your shoes don't breath. Feet tend to sweat and can become itchy as moisture and dark places can create fungi., Don't be afraid to use your beard trimmer between your eyes or use pluckers at first to welcome two eyebrows. Unibrow is a no-no even if it's hardly noticeable. Don't forget to splash your preferred aftershave on or any skin creams that you use.,, If you chose antiperspirant with deodorant it may make your armpits on shirts yellow and deodorant alone may not be strong enough. Bleach your white tees every so often to get the yellow stains out if you enjoy the longevity of armpit scent., It's great if you have a variety, that way your hair stays on edge, and works with you. Trying out different kinds for your hair type can make a huge difference.

They will spray double making it unpleasant for others as they walk by. Change it up so you can smell it as fresh as everyone else!
