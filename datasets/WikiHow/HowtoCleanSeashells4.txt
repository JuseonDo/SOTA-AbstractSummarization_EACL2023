 Cook them for a few minutes.
 The time it takes to microwave your shells will vary depending on your microwave and the size and quantity of shells.
 Use tongs or a towel to take the shells out, they will be very hot.
 Using tweezers to remove the organism might help if it is too hot to use your fingers.
