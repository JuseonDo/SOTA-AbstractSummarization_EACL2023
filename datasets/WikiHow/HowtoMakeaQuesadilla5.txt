 To prevent the tortilla from getting soggy, consider placing a paper towel underneath it.
 Make sure that the cheese is spread evenly across the entire tortilla.
 If you are using meat or vegetables, make sure that they are cooked most of the way through; they will cook the rest of the way in the microwave.
 The tortilla will break if you try to fold it in half, so you will have to cover it with another piece. You can press down lightly on the tortilla to "seal" it.
 The quesadilla will not be as crispy as one made in a frying pan, oven, or grill. If the cheese is not melted, microwave the tortilla for another 30 to 60 seconds.
 The old plate will likely be too hot to handle without any pot holders.
 Consider serving the quesadilla with some sour cream or salsa.
