If you do not have leftover rice from a previous dinner, bring 2 cups (473ml) of water to a rolling boil. Add 2 cups (370g) of white basmati rice. Place the lid on the rice pot and turn the temperature to low. Allow it to simmer for 20 minutes. Check it near the end to make sure it does not stick. Place it on a cold burner for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Place the rice on a cookie sheet to cool until it is room temperature.






You can also use a rice cooker to quickly make the rice. Then, leave it on a cookie sheet in the kitchen or refrigerator to cool.
