@summary
use your breast pump as directed until your milk comes in.

@summary
have your lactation consultant show you and your partner how to encourage a proper latch.

@summary
if it doesn't work, have your committed partner feed the bottle so that the baby associates your breast with receiving food.
@article
 Before your milk comes in, just five minutes of pumping will bring a big benefit. Before pumping, have a cheap wide-mouth bottle handy containing 2 oz. of colostrum, purchased or donated breast milk, or infant formula.;
, Pump until you see the first drop of colostrum, then patiently offer the breast to your baby.


Just snuggling with your baby will encourage milk production, and you may be surprised to find that breastfeeding works once your nipple has been "primed" by the pump.
 Pump up to 20 minutes.
