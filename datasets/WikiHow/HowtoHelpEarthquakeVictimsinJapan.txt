 If you have information about anyone in Japan, try adding it to the following:


Google Person Finder. You can use this to both find and provide information about someone missing or found.
US citizens can use the US State Department information site.
Use Twitter and Facebook as a way of sharing information about the whereabouts of people and for connecting people up again. You could also share your donation links on these sites, explaining that you've used them to donate and encourage others to do so too.
Some online community boards might be available for use in your country to leave messages about finding people. Do an online search for such boards.
 Hope Letters help by collecting online messages, translating them into Japanese and delivering them via local organizations. You can submit your message at http://hopeletters.wordpress.com/.
 Better place charities not only take money, but also clothing, chairs, desks etc. Donate what you want, where you want.
 Other things you can do to fundraise include:


Hold a bake sale (quake bake) and send the proceeds to the fundraiser of choice.
Organize a triathlon, marathon, or other sporting event. Collect sponsorships and fundraising monies to send to the Japanese charity of choice through tickets, collection buckets, raffles, sponsoring per mile/goal, etc.
Auction off items of value such as items signed by sports stars and politicians, business donations, etc. Explain that all winnings go to charity; to prove this, offer to provide the winner with bank proof of payment of the winnings into the charity's account.
Hold a charity drive or gala at your local school and send all the proceeds to a school in need in Japan.
Take a collection bucket to work or to neighbors and family who know you and ask if they'll donate. Keep all donation receipts for proof of donation in case somebody asks for this. You might want to ask only people you know because other people might not feel that they can trust you if they don't know you; this will depend on where you live.
