 (Galatians 5:19,20). Paul groups these sins together because they are the basic fruits of the sinful nature. Paul says "if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeed of the body, you will live." If we put to death all of these acts of our sinful nature we will live, but the choice is ours. We can chose to walk in the flesh or in the Spirit as Christians.;
, (Galatians 5:21) Jesus said that "you shall know them by their fruits." Also James said "show me your faith without deed and I will show you my faith by what I do." If we are true followers of Christ, we will live differently. We will live out the fruit of the spirit rather than the misdeed of our flesh.
 Against such things there is no law." (Galatians 5:23)

, "Since we live by the Spirit let us keep in step with the Spirit." (Galatians 5:25). This means that we should seek to walk in these fruits in all that we do in life and in every situation that we find ourselves in.
