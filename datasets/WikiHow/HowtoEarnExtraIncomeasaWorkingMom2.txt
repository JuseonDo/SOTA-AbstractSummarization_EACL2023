, You can earn up to $10 an hour per child by babysitting in your home for a few hours in the evenings and on weekends.
 Many working moms are constantly running their washing machines and dryers. Add a few loads of other people's laundry for a fee that will cover your supplies and add a little extra income to your budget.
 You can provide low key catering for those who do not have the time or the interest to prepare their own meals. Make meals and snacks while you are packing lunches for the kids or preparing freezer-friendly dinners for the week.
