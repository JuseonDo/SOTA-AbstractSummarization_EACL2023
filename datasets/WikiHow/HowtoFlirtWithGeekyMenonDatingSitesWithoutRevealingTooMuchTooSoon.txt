 The reason I say upload 3 photos is because you want one of your face, a full body shot and one of you in your best clothes (a picture of you at a party, wedding, etc);
, Don't use bad language, no slang or deliberate miss spelling as it's not really something a man of the geeky/nerdy world will enjoy reading and will most defiantly just skim to the next person.
 Not only will you be putting yourself at risk, but your account will be permanently deleted as it's reviewed before it's published. Also, you cannot add any personal contact details in the description, as it's another way of having your account deactivated.
 You want to list what personality traits best suits you as a person and if you want to add certain physical attractions you may have, don't make it too long. There aren't going to be many "supermodel" types around on the site. Here's some good examples of what to list for the physical aspect of the description: Good hygiene, tall, with or without glasses,etc.
 The site has a handy feature where you can search for matches based on your area. They will either send you local or out of area matches, but it will always be in the country you'll be living in.
 Check to see how often they have been using the site as well, because if they use it regularly, you have more of a chance at getting a response.
 Spamming is when a user sends irrelevant and offensive messages or is trying to promote a product through illegal advertising methods.
 Use positive language, ask questions of your own but nothing sexually suggestive, offensive or anything too personal, as this could give the user the wrong idea.
 With email accounts, it's easy to block a contact that you will either find distressing and/or offensive.
 You're still at the "getting to know each other stage", but if asked about your views on those topics, it's ok to be honest about your views on them, just as long as the newly found interest isn't being told that you want that with him.
