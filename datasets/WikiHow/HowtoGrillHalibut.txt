Look for steaks that appear solid without a fishy smell, and keep in mind that thicker steaks take longer to grill.;

Halibut steaks go well with just about any herbs or spices, so you can season them as preferred. A tasty marinade can be easily made with lemon or lime juice, parsley, pepper, oil and other desired seasonings.



Grilled halibut turns out moist and tender when allowed to soak in marinade in the refrigerator for an hour prior to grilling. If you prefer not to use a marinade, baste each side of your halibut steaks with oil before you put them on the grill.



Vegetable, canola or olive oil are good choices for grilling halibut. Be sure to add more oil if the grill dries out before your halibut steaks are ready, especially if you choose not to use a marinade.



If your halibut steaks are thicker than 1 inch (2.5Â cm), grill them up to 15 minutes on each side.
