 Make sure that you have the spade between the two and place this on top. Place a club on the bottom of the deck. For example, on top of the deck you have an ace of hearts first, queen of spades second and ace of diamonds third. The bottom card of the deck is the queen of clubs. Now you are ready!

,, (To give you some time to get a double lift ready, ask the spectator what card he has and to look at it to make sure it is ok.)








, Place this on top of the ace of hearts. Say, "I will teach you the move in slow motion."

, What you are trying to do here is make the spectator believe that you are switching the heart and the diamond. After you shove it in and out your hand goes to the top of the deck, releases the heart, and grabs the other queen from the bottom of the deck.
 The most difficult part of this trick is the last switch. To make it easier, you have to keep on talking. While you are switching from the deck say, "Now, do you bet the heart is on the top or bottom?" You have to be quick and keep the spectator's eyes off of the deck. The spectator will then make a prediction but they are totally wrong!
