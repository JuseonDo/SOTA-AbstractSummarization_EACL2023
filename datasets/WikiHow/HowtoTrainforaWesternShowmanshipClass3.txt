determine the cue for halt.
@article
 The horse should stop beside you. You can also command to halt and them walk into the halt, depending on the patterns.
 Some horses respond to a simply whisper of whoa, others a tug. Some stop when you stop moving. Experiment but ensure you allow enough time for the cue to sink in and be able to work.
