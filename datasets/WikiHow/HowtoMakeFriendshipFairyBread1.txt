 When the butter is melted, set it aside to cool. It is important that you cool the butter before working with it because you do not want the sugar to melt too fast - you want it crystallized on the top of each biscuit.;
, Flatten or roll out the buttermilk biscuits, making sure to lay them on a flat surface.


This step is optional, but if you want to take this recipe to the next level, do not skip this step! If you do choose to skip this step, bear in mind you will still have to make the sugar mixture.
 Fill the biscuit holes with a small amount of the sugar mixture, then cover the holes with the biscuit center that was cut out.
 Using a muffin tray lined with cupcake wrappers, place about one or two biscuits (or three or four depending on the size) inside every wrapper.
 Sprinkle on the remaining sugar mixture if there is any left. In the case where you have run out of the sugar mixture, sprinkle on some cinnamon instead.
 Take the fairy bread cups and leave them on a wire rack to cool. Do not leave them inside the muffin tray - it will be harder to cool.
 If desired, you can add a few drops of food coloring. The consistency of the icing should be runny, but not too runny where it is like water. It should be opaque as well.


You can omit the lemon juice and use other extracts as well. If you want to keep your icing plain, it tastes great that way too. You can also substitute water for milk! Use less milk though, because it is richer. However, it is entirely up to you.
 Lastly, sprinkle some 100s and 1000s to complete the fairy bread cups. You can wait until the icing has set to serve them, or you can eat them immediately.
