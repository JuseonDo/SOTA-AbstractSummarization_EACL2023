Make sure the spirals are of same size so that they look good when you stretch them.
 Carefully spread the potato out onto the skewer.



You may also add some salt and spices to it depending on how you want your potatoes to be.



Bake them at 160 C for 25 minutes.
The time may vary depending on the thickness of your slices.
 You may serve it with a healthy meal or to accompany your burger.
