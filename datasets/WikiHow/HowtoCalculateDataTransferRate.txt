@summary
to get kb/s you must first convert mega bytes to kilo bytes.

@summary
convert minutes into seconds.

@summary
divide kilo bytes by seconds to get the rate.
@article
 Since a Mega byte is roughly 1000 Kilobytes we will multiply it by 1000. We get 25,000 Kilobytes.;
, Since a minute is 60 seconds we know that 2 minutes is 120 seconds (2x60=120).
 25,000/120=208.3. We'll round it too 210. So now we have a rate of 210 KB/s.
