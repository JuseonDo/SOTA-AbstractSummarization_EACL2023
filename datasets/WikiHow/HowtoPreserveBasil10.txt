@summary

@summary

 Allow the bees and other pollinators to do their thing.


You'll know the seeds are ripe when a gentle shake of a flowering head in your hand releases tiny black specks.
 Gently place the spikes into a paper bag.


Don't shake the spikes.
 Hang in a warm and dry area for at least a week. When the stems of the flower spike have dried, the seeds can be harvested.
 Tip the seeds into a bowl or pan. Sift out the debris, stems, etc., and discard. Pour the seeds into a small jar, such as a spice jar, label and store. Use next season.
