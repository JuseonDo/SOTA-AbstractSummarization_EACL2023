 Q fever is primarily a professional hazard. The following is a list of jobs that may put you at higher risk of contracting Q fever:


Livestock farmers.
Sheep and dairy workers.

Meat processing plant workers.
Researchers at facilities that house sheep.
Veterinarians.;
, However, the conditions differ for animals that receive daily attention, so the disease is found less often in these animals.
, Watch for a sudden onset of:


Feeling of overall sickness.
High fever (up to 104-105Â° F).
Relentless headache.

Vomiting.
Nausea.

Diarrhea.
Stomach pain.

Sore throat.
Tender, aching muscles.
Mental confusion.
Chills.
Sweats.
Non-productive (dry) cough.

Chest pain.
 Weight loss can occur and can continue for some time. Thirty to fifty percent of people who suffer a significant infection will develop pneumonia. A large number of those infected will have abnormal results on liver function tests. Some will develop hepatitis.
 Treatment should be started within 3 days of the first signs of infection. Generally treatment lasts 2-3 weeks. Most patients will recover within 2-3 months without any treatment. However, if the infection lasts for more than 6 months (a rare occurrence among well persons), the chronic form of the disease may develop.
