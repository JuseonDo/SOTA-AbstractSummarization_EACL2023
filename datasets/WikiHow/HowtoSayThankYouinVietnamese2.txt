 Vietnamese culture dictates that smiles are often used to convey appreciation instead of a verbal expression of thanks. Think of a smile as a silent “thank you.” Modesty is highly respected in Vietnamese culture, and deflecting a compliment with a smile is the best way to express appreciation for a compliment modestly.Similarly, if you pay someone a compliment, do not expect them to express their gratitude verbally.
 In English, people are often quick to say “hello,” as well as “thank you” and “sorry” in many different contexts. In Vietnamese culture, a smile often take the place of these phrases.

Accordingly, do not be offended if you do not receive a verbal thank you for a favor.In particular, do not expect someone who is your parents age or a teacher to say thank you. Instead, you will likely receive a nod.
