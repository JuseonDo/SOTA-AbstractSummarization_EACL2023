 You can choose another block, instead, if you prefer, but be sure that a stair and a slab of this block exists.


Wood planks
Cobblestone
Brick

Nether brick
Quartz
Sandstone;
, If you want to build a bigger path, make the hole wider, but make sure that the width of the hole is odd (for example, 3, 5, 7 and so on.)

, To climb a hill just place stairs instead of half slabs. The stairs, avoid the player to jump.
 If the path goes up or down a hill, the stairs can be placed next to the other stairs, like this.The result should look like this.
, If you want to use the path with your horse, it's recommended to build a 6 block high street light. This height avoids you to hit the block if you jump.
, You can use glowstone, or other light source like a jack o lantern.
 Additional protection from light sources is not necessarily because mobs can't spawn on half slabs and stairs.
