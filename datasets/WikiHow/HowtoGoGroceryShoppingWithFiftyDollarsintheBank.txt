 Make a detailed list, organized by the area of the store you will find the item (produce, deli, meats, dairy, frozen, grocery, etc.). You can customize the list to fit the aisles at your favorite store and save a lot of time. This will also keep you from impulse shopping as you can just grab-and-go with most items. Buy only the items on your list!;

 They are an excellent way to save money on certain items. Make sure that the coupons that you have can be used in your store. Mark your list with a "c" or other symbol to remind yourself that you have a coupon for that item.
