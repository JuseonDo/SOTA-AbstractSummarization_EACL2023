 Do you already have a Mac? If so, they will not want to pay for another one. Do your parents have PCs that are constantly slow for your use? Make sure that your reasons will mean something.;
, For example, if you wanted one in 3rd grade versus 6th.


Maybe convince them to get one at the beginning of 6th grade because you will have more papers to write and things to research.
Tell them Macs are more reliable and have a much lesser chance of getting viruses than Windows.
,, See what they have to say.



I will have a lot of papers to write and more things to research and you will not want me hogging your computer.
I can put all my documents on it. You will not have to have my documents clogging up your space on your computer.
