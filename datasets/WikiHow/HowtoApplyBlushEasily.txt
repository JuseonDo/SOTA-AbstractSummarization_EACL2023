 According to most magazines, the trick is to find a color that matches your cheeks when they're flushed after exercise or being out in the cold. For a quick test, 'spank' your cheeks and use the resulting color as a guide. (We suggest doing this in the comfort of your home away from other people, wink). Another trick is to match your lip color. Fair skin looks great in rose, olive in peach & dark skin in apricot or even red.;
, Powder is typically best for oily & combo skin. Cream is great for dry skin. Liquid and gel are great for oily skin.
 While blush is usually your 2nd-to-last makeup step (before powder), you should experiment with what works best for you.
 Use a kabuki brush like the pros.
, If you can't find your apples, simply smile. Blend well, so even if you put too much, you can calm it down.
