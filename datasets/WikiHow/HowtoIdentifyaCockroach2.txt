 German cockroaches are slightly larger than Brown Banded roaches. They can grow to ½ an inch long, which is about the exact same size as an American penny (again, minus the antenna).
 The German roach is best recognized by the two parallel lines that run from the back of the cockroach’s head down to its wings. The stripes or lines are dark brown in color and can appear almost black., German cockroaches love moist, warm areas. You can generally find them in your kitchen or bathroom, lurking next to the dishwasher or sink. They are also notoriously present in garbage, which is where they find most of their food.
 German cockroaches are the number one roaches found in homes in large numbers. If you think you have an infestation, there is a good chance that you are dealing with German cockroaches.
