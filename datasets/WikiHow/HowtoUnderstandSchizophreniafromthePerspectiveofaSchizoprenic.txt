 Studying writings contributed by doctors and other health professionals will only offer you an understanding of schizophrenia from a scientific point of view. It may be concluded to some extent that these articles, studies, and opinions may be construed as biased in some people's view. The opinions expressed by professionals may have a basis of fact, but so have the opinions of people who've been living with these conditions for years.;
, This experience means that they have valuable insight into how someone with a severe mental illness ought to be treated. Keep in mind that conflict between how a doctor believes someone should be treated for their illness and how another individual is treated or believes someone should be treated is rarely useful.
, As a non-sufferer, it is very easy to slip into certain patterns of thought regarding this disease, since it is usually portrayed in a hyperbolic manner.
 Be ready to hear their perspectives as well.
 Until the mentally ill individual can admit that their mind is troubled, they may self-medicate which only worsens the disorder. It is vital for everyone close to the individual, people who have the individual's best interests in mind, to form an intervention and sit down with the person suffering.
 For instance, one person with schizophrenia reported: "It helped me greatly when the sane people around me would play along with my hallucinations because it made me feel the sanity in which I of course was struggling to find."., It might take a long time and require a lot of work with a psychiatrist but there is help available and you can lead a full and enriching life even with this disorder.
 In no way, shape, or form should you consider this article as an absolute. It is your decision how to face this disorder, but this will hopefully help you start.
