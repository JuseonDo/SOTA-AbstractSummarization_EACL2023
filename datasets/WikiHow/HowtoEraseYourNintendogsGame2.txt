 The Micro SD card is the smaller card that is inserted into the upper left corner of the R4 card.
 The card reader looks like a regular USB drive that connects to your computer, only it has a port for your Micro SD card on one end. This should have come in the package with your R4 card.
 A window will pop up with different options--select "Open folder." From there, open the "Games" folder and find the nintendogs sav. file.
 file into the trash to erase your game. You will lose all your saved progress--your dogs, money, trainer points, and items you have purchased. Make sure you really want to lose all those things before deleting the file!

, Return the R4 to your DS and open Nintendogs. Your game will be gone and you can start all over.
