 Most herbs are more expensive clean than grimy, as they are needed for fast herblore training. Some good ones are Kwuarm and Lantadymes. Buy as many of them as you can.
 Good ones are the Castle Wars chest and the Soul Wars chest. Set up your bank presets so that you can click the preset and get an inventory of grimy herbs.
