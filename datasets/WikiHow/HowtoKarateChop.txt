 Chopping with the grain makes the wood easier to break.


Choose thin, smooth board for chopping, such as slim pine boards.
Don't try to chop anything that is too thick or hard (3" maximum is suggested to start). A cinder block may be possible if you have been training for a few weeks and yell very loudly when making contact.;
, This involves either standing up, with legs shoulder-width apart or kneeling with your knees vertical from your shoulders, two feet from the chopping blocks.
 Freaking out will not help since the key to successful striking is the mind, you want to stay as calm as possible before you strike.


Imagine your hand going through the wood or brick. If you can't see it happening, chances are it won't happen. This could be bad if it doesn't. Remain positive. Be one with the chopping motion.
,,, Do not remove your hand from the chopping blocks immediately––your hand needs to go all the way through to make the break.
 If you feel very little pain, try to improve your speed. A little extra strength is also helpful for successful karate chopping.


The edge and heel of the hand can take quite a lot of force provided they are the parts of your hand that contact with the wood.However, as a learner, it is best to have someone mentor you or, if that is not possible, to bring down your hand gently and with repeated practice, increase the force.
If you feel great pain, stop for the day. If any serious damage to your body has occurred, see a doctor immediately.
 The more you practice, the better your accuracy and ability to hit.
