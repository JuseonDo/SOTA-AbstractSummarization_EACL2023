 Wait at least 1 minute for the oil to start bubbling a little bit., This will give it enough time to turn nice and brown.
 Add 1/2 lb. finely-chopped onion and 3 cloves minced garlic and cook them for at least 2-3 minutes.
 Add 1 tbsp. ground cumin, 1 tbsp. ground coriander, 1/2 tsp. allspice, and 1/4 tsp. chili powder to the sausage. Stir the ingredients until you've combined them all.
 Serve the sausage hot, sprinkled with 1/4 cup of chopped parsley.
