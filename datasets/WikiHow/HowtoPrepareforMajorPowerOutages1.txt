 Some good places to store these lights would be your living room, kitchen and at least one of the bedrooms.


These emergency light sources can include battery operated flashlights, hand cranked or rechargeable flashlights, or candles. Always be sure that you keep extra fresh batteries and/or matches on hand.;
, The radio should have an alternate power supply such as hand-cranking or batteries.This way, you will be able to hear important weather updates, as well as know what the current time is.
 Cordless phones only operate when electricity is present and extended outages can drain cellphones.
 Include a few days of prescription medications, if needed.


You should also include specialty items for infants or seniors. These items should include formula, extra diapers and extra battery packs for breathing apparatuses.
 You might also consider a portable heater or firewood if you have a fireplace or wood stove. This is needed for a winter blackout, as once the power goes out, the heat won't work, so it is important that you try your best to stay warm.
 This should include tools such as a hammer, screwdriver and duct tape. During the winter, it should also include, in addition to the tools, snow removal equipment and rock salt or sand for traction.
