 You want the seaweed to be crunchy and tasty, not soggy and unpleasant to eat.;
, Moisten (not drench) the other hand with water and put a thin layer of rice on one half of the seaweed.
 This is optional, but it brings a little more taste to the sushi.
 The choice of fish is up to the person; ahi (tuna) and salmon are top preferences.
 This is optional to taste, but there are many varieties of temaki that include vegetables and goodies, such as avocado, cucumber, egg, tofu, taikuan (picked radish), etc. A list of sushi ingredients can be found here.
 Tuck the end in and finish off by rolling it into a cone shape. To keep the cone together take one kernel of rice and squash it into the corner. This will stick the end down, holding the Nori in position.
