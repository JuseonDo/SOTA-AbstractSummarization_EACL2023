 Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of cold water into a small bowl. Stir in 2 envelopes of unflavored gelatin. Set the bowl aside for 10 minutes so that the gelatin can "bloom." During this time, you can prepare the rest of the ingredients., Lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9 by 9-inch (22.86 by 22.86-centimeter) baking pan with cooking oil. Generously dust it with powdered sugar or cornstarch., Pour the remaining ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water into a saucepan. Stir in the granulated sugar (not the powdered sugar). Clip a candy-making thermometer to the saucepan so that it's ready for the next step., Stir the gelatin water into the sugar water. Bring the solution to a boil over medium heat. Let it cook until it reaches 240°F (115°C). Do not stir during this time., Once the sugar water reaches 240°F (115°C), take the saucepan off the stove and set it down onto a heat-safe surface. Stir in the salt and vanilla extract. If you don't like vanilla, you can leave it out or replace it with a different extract., Pour the sugar water into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with whisks. Beat it on a low-speed setting for 2 minutes, then beat it on high for 10 to 15 minutes. It's ready when it turns soft and twice its size., Use a rubber spatula to help spread the mixture across the bottom of the pan, from corner-to-corner. If the marshmallow mixture is sticking to the spatula, lightly coat it with cooking oil first., Leave it uncovered someplace where it won't get disturbed. Once it finishes cooling, dust it with ½ cup (65 grams) of powdered sugar., Turn the marshmallow slab onto a cutting board. Use a pizza cutter or a sharp knife to cut it into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) squares. If the marshmallows are too sticky, coat the blade with some cooking oil., Pour some more powdered sugar into a rimmed baking sheet. Roll the marshmallows around in the powdered sugar, then dust off any excess sugar. This will help keep them from sticking to each other.
