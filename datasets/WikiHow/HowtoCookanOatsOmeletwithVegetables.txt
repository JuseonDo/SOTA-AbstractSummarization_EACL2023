 Break the eggs and beat them with little salt.;
,, These can include  red, green or yellow capsicum, sweet corn, spring onion, beans, green peas, carrot, onion, green chillies and cilantro.
 Add the powdered oats and the chopped veggies and beat it together. Add salt to taste. Don't add too many veggies, or add extra egg to make it a more eggy batter. Add some minced ginger and garlic to get a different flavour.
 Pour the mixture into the heated pan. Sprinkle some black-pepper on the top. Cover the lid so that it gets cooked properly from inside.
