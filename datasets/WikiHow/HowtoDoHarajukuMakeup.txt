 If you have colored contact lenses to change your eye color you can put them in before or after you do your makeup. This step is optional.


It is recommended to put them in before so that you don't smudge your makeup.;
, Blend the foundation with your fingers, a brush, or sponge to make your skin look as smooth as possible.
 Or, just highlight them with a very subtle pink to give them a very Lolita, pale look.



Apply the eyeshadow all over your lid and just above the crease.
If you want brighter eyes, take the same color and smile widely, then take the color and apply it to the little bag that forms under your eye.
 Apply in a 'U' shape on the corners of your lid and going towards the crease. Continue to apply until the pink is the color you want. Gently blend the pink inwards to your tear duct.
 After, take a very light brown and carefully brush it over your bottom lashes

, Use a lengthening and volumizing mascara and apply one coat to the upper lashes. Very carefully coat the outermost lower lashes. Once the top coat is dry, apply a second coat to the outermost upper lashes.


Continue until lashes are as desired.
 Apply a very thin line as close to your upper lashes as you can get, making sure both sides are fairly equal.
 Use a light coat of mascara to blend falsies and your natural lashes together.


Take individual lashes and apply them to the outer corners of your bottom lashes. This is optional.
 Use a small angled brush to fill in your eyebrows.
 Shape your lips to look small and cute.
