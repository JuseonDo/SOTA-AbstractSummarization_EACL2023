 A paring knife is the most useful knife for fruit carving.


It gives form
It creates sharp edges
It bends inwards into the fruit easily.;
, This can create strips, grooves, and the resulting fruit peels can be connected using skewers and toothpicks.
 Not only melons but other types of fruit can be turned into ball shapes for adding to carved fruit displays. Choose one with a sturdy handle and of good make.
 These instruments are Great for chiseling out internal soft fruit flesh or for creating fragments out of the outer skin of fruits. Strawberry slits can be cut to make a strawberry's fleshy tissue unwrap out like the petals of a flower, like a strawberry rose.
 Using the "V" cutter, you can make an apple swan. The "V" cutter cuts to bisect the apple to make wings by pushing against each slice.
