 The target can be your index finger, a target stick or something else. Tell your dog to come and sit in front of you. Let the dog sniff at the target about five times before beginning the real training. Click and reward the dog when she sniffs at the target.;
, Don't require the dog to stand upright yet. Just let her lift her and use her muscles. The dog should take a smell at the target. Then click and give her a treat. Repeat this 10-15 times, then take a break.
 Don't let the dog stand like this longer than a second or so. Do this 10-15 times or until the dog seems to fully understand.
 When the dog can stand like that for five seconds, you are ready to move on to the next step.
 Click when you see the smallest sign of her jumping towards the target. Do this 10-15 times.
 The dog should jump several steps in the end. Remember to have the dog in front of you, and let her jump towards you. Increase the distance.
 In the beginning, just accept the fact that the dog stands up. Then you want her to jump, more and more.
 You can choose to say: "Jump", "Hop", "Bounce" or "Kangaroo". Whatever you want to call it, call it something that is easy to remember and that doesn't get mixed up with any other tricks. Say your command when your dog does the behaviour, but only say it once. Otherwise the dog will not do it unless you say it several times.
 See if your dog reacts to the command. If she doesn't, you need to sharpen the trick and slow down.
