@summary
tie the fabric into a tight knot.

@summary
center the two 24" (60cm) pieces of florist's wire over the knot.

@summary
wrap the wires around the knot, and twist them tightly to make them secure.

@summary
place the candle over a lighter or other open flame until the wax melts down into a liquid state.

@summary
place the knot into the hot, melted wax and let it soak for three to five minutes.

@summary

@summary
remove the newly created wick from the wax.

@summary
wrap the aluminum-foil strip around the knot in the center of the wick.

@summary
cut three bamboo skewers in half lengthwise using either a razor blade or a utility knife.

@summary
line the split bamboo up end to end on a table to make a single long strip.

@summary
secure the overlapping connection points together with non-flammable tape.

@summary
tape the ends of the foil-wrapped wires that protrude from the wick to opposite sides of the bamboo frame.

@summary
hang 16-20 pieces of kitchen paper towel (or about half that of tissue paper) on a clothesline using clothespins (pegs).

@summary
,

@summary
place a plastic or canvas drop cloth under the paper to catch any drippings.

@summary
,

@summary
spray both sides of each piece of paper thoroughly with the fireproofing spray.

@summary
draw a vertical line 40" (about 1 meter) long down the center of the brown craft paper.

@summary
draw a horizontal line 12" (30cm) long at the base of the vertical line.

@summary
draw a second horizontal line that is 22" (1/2 meter) long approximately two thirds of the way up the vertical line.

@summary
connect the two horizontal lines by sketching a line that curves gently inward before meeting the vertical line.

@summary
draw a second line mirroring the line that you just drew to connect the left tips of the two horizontal lines.

@summary
,

@summary
sketch mirroring lines that connect each end of the upper horizontal line to the top of the vertical line.

@summary
cut the shape that you've drawn out of the brown craft paper using scissors.

@summary
lay the 16-20 fireproofed paper pieces on a flat surface.

@summary
use a non-flammable glue to seal the overlapped ends of the papers together.

@summary
lay one 2-piece panel of paper towel/tissue paper over the brown craft paper pattern.

@summary
repeat this step with the remaining 2-piece paper panels.

@summary
,

@summary
connect the pointed tips of the paper towel/tissue paper panels together.

@summary
attach the opening of the paper bag to the bamboo frame.

@summary
fold the end of the paper bag upward to cover the frame.

@summary
take your lantern outside at night or at dusk.

 Trim the end pieces so they are approximately 1" (2.5cm) on each side. The end pieces will become the wicks of the candle that will propel your sky lantern much as a flame propels a hot air balloon.;
, The two pieces should be perpendicular to each other with their midpoints overlapping on top of the knot.
 The four wire ends should be approximately 9" to 10" (23 to 25cm) long on each side so that they are long enough to reach the lantern's bamboo frame. Set the wire-wrapped knot aside.
 You should also place a plate or a tray beneath the candle to catch the wax as it melts.
, As it cools, the wax will harden.
 Twist the ends of the foil strip around the metal wire so that they cover the wire completely.
 Run the split bamboo through the flame of a candle while subtly bending it; this will make the bending job easier and you should be able to form a a full circle in less than five minutes., The bottom end of one skewer should overlap with the top end of another skewer to create a 1" (2.5cm) overlapping connection point.



Bring the right and left tips of the long strip together. Again, create a 1" (2.5cm) overlap with the tips.
Secure the tips together with tape to make a circle.



The wires should cross the exact center of the circle so that the circle is divided into four equal quarters. The candle should be centered in the middle of the circle and supported by the wires that are attached to the bamboo frame.
Twist the wires around the frame. Wrap the wire connections with tape to make them more secure.

Avoid spraying the points where the clothespins are holding the paper. Otherwise, the paper will tear.
Allow the pieces to dry before you continue working with them.
 Use a tape measure or a ruler to measure your line precisely.
 The line should be perpendicular to the vertical line, and the base of the vertical line should touch the midpoint of the horizontal line so that you have 6" (15cm) on either side of the vertical line.
 The second horizontal line should be parallel to the first, and the vertical line should also cross through the midpoint of the horizontal line so that you have 11" (28cm) on either side of the vertical line.
 The line should extend from the right end of the bottom horizontal line, curve inward and then stretch out to meet the right end of the second horizontal line.
, This will finish the shape of your pattern, which should look like the pointed blade of a tropical ceiling fan.
 This shape will serve as the pattern for creating your balloon.



Set out two rows consisting of 16-20 pieces of kitchen paper towel (or 8-10 pieces of tissue paper).






The top, shorter width of one row of papers should touch the bottom, shorter width of the other piece of row papers.






Overlap the connected ends of the papers by about 1" (2.5cm) so that you can glue them together.
 Allow the overlapped seams to dry while they lay on the flat surface. When gluing the paper, gently spread it out––do not blot––this way, you can avoid glue marks in the paper (and blotting can cause weakening in the balloon body's adhesion).
 Center the pattern piece beneath the paper towel/tissue paper and cut the paper towel/tissue paper with scissors so that it matches the exact size and shape of the pattern that you've placed beneath it.
, Glue the tips together so that they are secure, leaving the base open to create a large bag.
 Tuck the frame about 1" (2.5cm) inside the opening of the bag.



Glue the folded end to the inside of the balloon to secure the frame to the balloon.
Allow the glue to dry completely before attempting to launch the lantern.
 Light the wicks, which are the ends that protrude from the wax-dipped knot, and hold the lantern for a few seconds until the wicks catch fire completely.


Make your wish. Then, let go of the lantern.
