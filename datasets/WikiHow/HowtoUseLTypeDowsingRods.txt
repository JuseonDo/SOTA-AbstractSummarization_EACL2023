@summary
you should be in a relaxed state of mind when dowsing.

@summary
grasp your "l" rods in the palms of your hands, curling your fingers and thumb around the plastic sleeves lightly, yet firmly.

@summary
with the rods correctly griped, place your elbows along the side of your body for stability, and extend your lower arms and the rods straight out/pointing forward, roughly at shoulders length.

@summary
now that your arms are in the search position as noted above, and the rods in a neutral position, slowly walk around the search area while concentrating on the item you are looking for.

@summary
congratulate yourself once you are successful in your finds.

 If you don't succeed at first, relax, maybe try to meditate a bit, then try again. Practice makes perfect, of course some studying won't hurt either.;
, Neither the long top of the rods nor the bottom curved part should touch your hands in any way while holding them, and they should be free to swing without any interference.
 You should ideally hold the rods level for maximum movement and sensitivity, though you may drop the tips of the rods very slightly to dampen the movement in breezy conditions for further control.



To start out dowsing, you should lay out cards numbered 1-5 face down and in a line with about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) of separation between each card. You should shuffle the cards up so they are in a random order. Start at one end by asking a question, like "Show me where the card labeled 4 on it by crossing the rods as I walk by", walk slowly until the rods start to move. Once you get a positive confirmation, flip the card to see if you are right. Practice this until you get the hang of it.
