think of what kind of actions your characters will be doing, step by step.

rewrite the panels on a different sheet of paper and fit them together .

this process can be done several times until the manga-ka sees the page as fit.

 In the first stage, plot out four to six boxes on a piece of paper and write your first actions in each box, with the caption under them.;
, Close-up or background-shot? Horizontal or vertical, maybe slanted? How does this effect the scene?

, If you are leaning towards traditional format, right-to-left panels are a nice idea. Decide in this part of the process what frames bleed out from the edges, but be careful to keep the important captions and drawings inside a "safe-zone".


Now, there doesn't have to be a gap between boxes like in American Marvel Comics. Usually, the borders separating each panel are just thin yet bold black lines. In some cases, the borders of a given panel will be left out entirely. This technique is called 'bleeding out' frames.
 After you've made the perfect page, ink it with inking multi-liner pens . Copic and Pigma are recommended highly.
