 Clean all old caulk, mildew and soap scum from the edge of bathtub. Be careful not to scratch surface of tub. Wipe with denatured alcohol to clean and remove any moisture from each seam. Rubbing alcohol contains oil that leaves residue (to keep from drying out your skin) and should not be used for cleaning.;
, There are choices in color and price. It seems more silicone costs more. Silicone caulk for kitchen and bath has a mildew preventer built in it.
 This is a technique that professionals use to ensure a perfectly even-looking bead with no mess. There should be about an eighth of an inch between the two pieces of tape.
 Using a sharp knife, cut the application tip on score mark. Opening should not be so big that a bead cannot be formed. Opening should not be so small that caulk tube seems highly pressurized. Most tubes have a thin barrier inside the tube to prevent the caulk from curing. Pierce the barrier by inserting a wire, nail or pointed object inside tip.
 Caulk should flow out, not squirt or drip. Release trigger lock to relieve the light pressure inside tube.
 Tip should be slightly above surface, nearly touching. As you begin to press trigger, watch flow of caulk. With one steady motion, move caulk gun straight along seam, creating a uniform bead. Before flow stops, quickly release trigger and begin to press again as you continue to create a uniform bead the entire length of seam. Do not stop until you reach corner.
,, Keep a few paper towels at hand to wipe your finger off if you need to.
 The bead should look neat and even, but you may need to clean it up slightly with your finger again for a perfect finish. Caulk must cure for 24/36 hours before exposing to water and moisture.
