 With a rake, remove any clumps of compacted dirt or roots completely.
 Good quality topsoil can also be mixed into the soil as long as it is not more than 20 percent clay.


Compost or other fertilizer can also be mixed into the soil at this point to provide essential nutrients for your lawn.
, Pass over the lawn with the spreader several times, going in the same direction, to apply half of the grass seed. Make a second pass over the area, going at right angles to the first pass, to apply the remainder of the seed.


If not using a drop-style spreader and using your hand instead, toss the seeds from roughly two or three feet to ensure more even coverage. Shoot to cover one square foot with about 1/3 of an ounce (30 grams per square meter).
,, Cover the surface with a layer of weed-free straw or hay, or high-quality compost. Apply the mulch lightly enough that some of the soil surface is visible through the mulch.
, This may require light watering two to four times each day.
 Begin mowing the grass when it reaches 2 1⁄2 to 3 inches (6.4 to 7.6 cm). After the first mow, keep a routine watering schedule of 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week.
