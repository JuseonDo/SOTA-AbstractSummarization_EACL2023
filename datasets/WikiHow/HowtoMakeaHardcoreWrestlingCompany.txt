 Try to use a name that has not been used before. For example, Super-Fun Wrestling would be SFW. The logo could be anything, even as simple as those letters in bold with a circle around it.;
, Try to find a place close to home, or even at your home (if it is O.K. with your parents).
 You can either buy one (the more expensive choice) or you can make your own. Please refer to the How To Build Your Own Wrestling Ring for details.
 This will make decisions not all upon you.
 Turn them into a DVD and sell them to some of the people at your school. This will give your business publicity and it will have more fans.
, Eventually, when you earn enough money, you can hire and pay other wrestlers and your friends. Try not to get into debt.
 Every once in a while, you can have a "pay-per-view" that has a higher ticket price.
 Mix it up with ladder matches, hardcore matches, TLC matches. To name a few.
 Create your own kind of extreme match, whether win by submission, or win by smashing a Singapore Cane across your opponent's head.
