@summary
we obtain the expression:x = -4 ± √(42 - 4•1•1) / 2

@summary
solve for x.

@summary
use your value for x to figure out the factors.

, You should get two x values. As shown above, we obtain two answers:

x = -2 + √(3) or x = -2 - √(3)

, Plug the x values you obtained into two polynomial expressions as the constants. These will be your factors. If we call our two answers h and k, we're writing two factors like so:(x - h)(x - k)

In this case, our final answer is:(x - (-2 + √(3))(x - (-2 - √(3)) = (x + 2 - √(3))(x + 2 + √(3))
