 It goes without saying, no matter where you're from, but in Ireland, drinking is part of the culture and atmosphere, so you need to be extra vigilant and realize that you are still not immune to it. Also, in a country such as Ireland where alcoholism is a rather serious matter, it won't hurt to look out for other folks who are driving erratically and appear to be drunk. Should you see someone in this condition, give them the right of way so that you don't get your own car damaged.;
, If you're in a larger city, such as Dublin or Cork, you don't need to always be on high alert, but in any city you'll see the occasional cardboard box, coffee cup or blown tire. If you're driving out west, in rural Ireland, where the roads may be nothing but dirt paths, it's especially important to look out for loose rocks or livestock.



Even if you're in the countryside, still do this. You never know how many other people you will happen upon.
 Switch drivers if you're in a group, especially if you're on an excursion in the countryside.
