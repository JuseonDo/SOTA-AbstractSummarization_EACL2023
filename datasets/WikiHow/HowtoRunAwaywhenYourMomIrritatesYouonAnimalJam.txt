 If they have few rules and you don't like one, you shouldn't run away. If they have spanked or punched you, it's a good choice to run away.
 This will add to the effect you are running away., Unbuddying them will make them a lot less likely to find you., Just in case your parent memorized your user you should lock your den so your ex-parent cannot come into it., You're not their child anymore!
