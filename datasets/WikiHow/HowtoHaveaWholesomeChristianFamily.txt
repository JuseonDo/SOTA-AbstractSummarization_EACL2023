 Instead of studying the dysfunctional family relationships, you may want to know: "What are some strengths of a healthy family?";
, Research those families that had two characteristics:


Those marriages that are considered happy and
Those that consider themselves satisfied in their parentâ€“child relationships.







Spend quality time with your family.With our ever increasing busy schedules, it is easy to lose focus on spending quality time with our family and children. It is important to remember that even though our children are nearing adulthood, they still require parental involvement.







Communication breakdown has been cited as a major cause of parent teen conflict over the years. There are endless activities to share with a child. It is important to take advantage of quality time with your child. Take time to enjoy your family. They are never too young to start spending time with, in fact the younger the better the result will be.
,,,, We all need prayer. Prayer is extremely vital for our survival. God desires the best for us and for our families. Besides praying for guidance, direction, wisdom, peace, and safety, we must constantly pray that our love ones will come to know Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. We must pray that our love ones have a relationship with the heavenly Father. Mother Teresa once said, "Prayer enlarges the heart until it is capable of containing God's gift of himself." We must pray that our loved ones find and stay in the will of God!

, Every day you will fight for God, and peace in your household. Let the Lord give you strength. It will eventually work out.
