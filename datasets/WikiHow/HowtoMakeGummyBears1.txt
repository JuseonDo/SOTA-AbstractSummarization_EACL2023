 Don't start the stove yet. It is simply easier to mix the ingredients right in the pan since the gummy mixture will stick slightly if you try and transfer it.;
, You can find this at most grocery stores in the baking aisle.









For a vegan substitute, try agar powder, found online.
 The most common brand is Jell-O. The flavor you use will determine the color and flavor of the final gummies.
 Just keep stirring occasionally so that all the gelatin is completely dissolved in into the water. Go slowly so that none of the candy burns.
 Any cup that is easily poured is fine. You can also use an eyedropper or a candy pump for more intricate designs.
 Simply pour the warm gelatin mixture into your candy mold and freeze until they are set. They are now ready to eat.








If you don't have a mold, you can make gummy drops on some parchment paper as well.
