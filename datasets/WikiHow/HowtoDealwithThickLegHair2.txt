 If you get your legs waxed at a salon, the process will be less painful as opposed to a home treatment. You can get your hair waxed for anywhere from $35-80 at a salon. Your skin will be smooth for three weeks on average. After that, it'll be time to return to the salon for another session.
 Although latest advances in waxing technology will allow you to wax your skin earlier than before, you still need to let hair grow to 2-4mm.Although no one likes having to wait for their hair to grow, 2 millimetres is barely anything, any you'll have it waxed off in no tie. Allowing your hair to grow longer may result in a more painful tear.


2-4mm may not be enough for cheaper waxing strips. It's a good idea to follow the instructions of whatever kit you're using.
