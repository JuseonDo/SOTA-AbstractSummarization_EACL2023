 Ask a teacher or your principal for information or a flier on the show.;
, Most schools have a sign up sheet, but if not, write a note to your teacher (or just tell him/her) including your name, talent, and why you would like to participate.
 If it's singing, dancing, acting, or evening juggling, you need some good advice.
 If you don't think you are that good, change what you will be preforming. Be careful about singing, though. You may need some advice from other people to know for sure.
 Unless you want to go on stage and make a fool of yourself, this is serious. You want to win, right?

, Whenever you have time, practice and takes notes on things that look/sound cool or things you shouldn't do.
 Get a good night sleep and lay out your outfit and props.
 Get dressed and make sure you smell good. Take your props in a canvas bag that has your name on it somewhere.
 If you mess up, DO NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS OF IT. If you act like you didn't mess up, most people won't think you did.
 If it's first place, good job! If you lose, be glad you got the chance.
 away.
