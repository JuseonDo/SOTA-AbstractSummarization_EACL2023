 The aloe vera allows for protection from the environment and has analgesic qualities that reduce swelling, soothe the irritation, and form a barrier which protects the skin from infection and promotes healing.
 In controlled studies, this has caused a 60% reduction in lesions and even allowed participants to continue shaving daily with minimal irritation., Though itâ€™s more commonly thought of as an anti-acne treatment, it has also been shown to treat razor burn.
 Alcohol dries out skin and further clogs pores.
 This can soothe the area by reducing inflammation.
 The most sure-fire way to overcome razor burn is to let the hair grow out. As you do this, keep the skin clean and exfoliated to prevent clogging the pores and further encouraging ingrown hairs.
 If this is a serious issue, you may want to take more stringent measures. Controlled studies have shown that laser treatments can significantly reduce razor bumps for months.
