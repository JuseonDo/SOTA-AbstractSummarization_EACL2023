 Here's a little chart to let you know if you're new to FPS games:

Assault Rifles are close to medium ranged weapons.



 


Sub-machine Guns are close to medium but are more of a use to use in between.






Heavy Machine Guns are more experimental as they lack accuracy.






Shotguns are strictly close ranged weapons but are very effective in close range.






Snipers are purely used for far ranged, but some people have have proved this wrong and use them as close as Shotguns. They have the potential to kill an enemy in just one shot






Melee are obviously close ranged. when the enemy is at an arms distance






The range of grenades varies widely in games, but are generally for medium range and used to flush out enemies in vantage points or in groups.

,, If they're far away use your rifle. If they are charging use your pistol, if they are in one group mow em down with your machine gun.
