 This is another awesome way to get started on your writing so you don't get stuck later on. This plan should make sense to you and not anyone else, so make sure it's low stakes writing.
 Choose a nice, calm and quiet place to do writing. Make sure it doesn't have distractions and somewhere you can concentrate. It could be the library, outside, in your room, pool etc.
 Get it from YouTube or download the app Relaxtopia to relax and don't put heavy, rock or pop music on.
