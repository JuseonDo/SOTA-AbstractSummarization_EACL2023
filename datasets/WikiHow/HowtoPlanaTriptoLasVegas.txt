 Get a general idea of when you want to go, and where you want to stay. Remember the weekends will be much more expensive and crowded.;
, Vegas is even cheaper in the summer, but that's usually because it's blazing hot.
 In addition to sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc. Sherman's and Travelzoo will email you with weekly travel deals. Also, check out discount airlines like JetBlue and Southwest. Always use the flight and hotel option.
 Decide what site you're going to use. You will see that some sites are not as cost efficient as they claim.
 The lowest price packages normally have flights that really are not as accommodating to the customer.
 Check out travel magazines like Conde Nast Travel & Leisure since they almost always mention things to do in Vegas.
 Check upcoming shows and events; they include variety and specialty shows, plays, musicals and comedy. The Smith Center is a great place to see shows.
,,,, See Bellagio's dancing fountains, the Mirage's erupting volcano, the Treasure Island's pirates and sirens, or the Fremont Street experience.
 They include the aquarium, zoo, auto racing, ballooning, boating, bowling, rafting, biking, hiking, climbing, horseback riding, thrill rides, air/ground/water tours, and more!

, The city is the "Marriage Capital of the World."

, These include people who require special care in facilities with roll-in showers, tubs with portable seats, pools with lifts, assisted listening devices or wheelchair seating.
 Look for special gay and lesbian nightlife entertainment in publications such as City Life, Las Vegas Mercury and Las Vegas Weekly.
