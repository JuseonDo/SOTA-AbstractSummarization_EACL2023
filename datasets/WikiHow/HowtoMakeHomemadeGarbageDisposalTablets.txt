 You need the pieces to fit easily into your ice cube tray so cut accordingly. Leave seeds and skin on lemons and limes--you’ll need the entire fruit for this project!;
, Fill all the way and don’t skimp on the citrus!

, Fill to the top, as though you were filling the tray to make ice.
 Leave in your freezer for at least 24 hours so the cubes are rock solid.
 Grasp by a piece of citrus fruit sticking out from the top and pull. The cube should come out.
 You don’t want someone putting one of these cubes in their drink by mistake!

, Add ½ cup of baking soda into the drain, followed by one pre-made cube. Push cube into disposal while disposal is not on. The mixture will bubble and fizz, releasing the citrus smell immediately.
