 If you are not in a happy relationship, you might have trouble being enthusiastic about your friend’s upcoming wedding. Explain that you’re afraid you’ll be Debbie Downer during this special time in her life.


You’ve recently ended a long-term relationship.
You’ve discovered your boyfriend has cheated on you.
You are single and wish you were in a relationship.
You are unhappily married, separated, or recently divorced.
 The last thing she wants is for a bridesmaid to faint and steal her thunder.
 Bridesmaids should have the skills, motivation, and punctuality to serve as Queen B’s worker bees.


Are you always late?
Do you have trouble taking direction and following instructions?
Do you easily become overwhelmed?
Do you hate participating in groups or being part of teams?
