 Racism is a system of advantage based on race. You have to remember your children are raised in a system that favors one person's race over another. For example, people of Middle Eastern descent are usually on many forms of the media for "terrorist" issues, while people of European descent are usually talking about their accomplishments, goals and are mainly politicians.
 Ask your children about who they think should be in power or who they like to see in power, and why?

, These mannerisms help racism continue and go unnoticed.
