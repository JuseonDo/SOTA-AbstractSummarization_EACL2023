, Joy when all was sadness, Life and hope you gave mankind, Mother of our gladness! Children of the sinful Eve, Sinless Eve, befriend us, Exiled in this vale of tears; Strength and comfort send us! Pray for us, O Patroness, Be our consolation! Lead us home to see your Son, Jesus, our salvation! Gracious are you, full of grace, Loving as none other, Joy of heaven and joy of earth, Mary, God's own Mother!

, Your light is everywhere. There is no place it cannot shine. Through you does confusion transform into a blessed sea of tranquility. Through you are miracles of all kinds brought to pass. Sacred Mother of gentleness and simplicity, You shine your power Into the thousands of worldly possibilities; Into the heart of the innocent, Into the heart of the doubter, Into the heart of those who blame and name, Into the heart of all who love you. Your power is unending. Sacred Mother, I surrender to you, To your sweetness. You are honey that flows from my heart. Mia Mater, Light of compassion, Hail!"
