Put on your eye protection., Heat the solution until it is almost boiling., Make sure to use the spatula to avoid burning yourself., You do not want to stir too vigorously and splash the hot solution onto your skin. Stir for up to 30 seconds after each new addition. , You want to ensure that the chemical reaction has occurred. This may take 1 to 2 minutes.
