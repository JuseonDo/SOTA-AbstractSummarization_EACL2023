 Spend five minutes, once or twice each day, in this relaxed state with this new belief and it will begin to plant the seeds necessary to create success.;
, Settle yourself comfortably, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes, get quiet and still, become aware of your breathing, relax…. Let your head, neck and shoulders relax more with each breath. Feel your breath flowing through your nose, into your lungs and moving down into your abdomen as you relax even more. Feel your breath gently guide you, connect to your body in a loving way. See yourself drift within to the inner space where you will welcome your baby.
 Feel the wonderful changes taking place in your body. Vividly create every detail in this future moment. Imagine the happy emotions. Feel the pleasant physical sensations as your baby starts stirring and kicking inside you. Make it very real!

, Put yourself into this future moment and feel it as a NOW moment. Feel yourself living everyday as a happy, pregnant mum. What other emotions do you have now that you are pregnant? What other positive changes have happened in the process?

, Look back at the past from this future moment. Notice what it feels like to know that the two of you are going to be parents. You are going to have a baby… you have succeeded! How do you feel? Celebrate, feel the emotions of your success!

, Allow yourself a few moments, become more aware of your body as you wiggle your fingers and toes. Have a gentle stretch and feel refreshed and alert.
 Do it every day, again and again.
