 If the bridle has been used on only one horse at only one setting, there will be a mark on the correct hole. If there are multiple marks or no marks at all, be sure you make a note so you don't have to re-fit the bridle.
 Leave it in this hot water throughout the whole process. If you have access to a dishwasher, it is a very effective way to clean a dirty bit.
 -note- do not put oil on the reins and only put very very little conditioner. They may become slippery.
, It may help to look at another bridle to see where everything goes and it which direction. It may also help to pretend you are putting the bridle on the horse and imagining which buckles would be where, and then put the straps together in that order. Be sure to have your trainer check it before you use it; an improperly put together bridle can be dangerous to your horse and may cause him to do unexpected things or not listen to the bit.
 using the same method.
