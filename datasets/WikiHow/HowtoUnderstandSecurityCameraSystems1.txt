 The video is stored on the DVR's Hard Drive. H.264 Compression DVR is the new compression industry standard. The H.264 Compression DVR stores 3x longer video than the older MPEG and MPEG4 Compression DVR's. I is old technology with less video storage. H.264 DVR's will enable higher video quality both live and over the internet.;
,, Remote viewing should be free and work with a dynamic IP address, as that is what you will use to access your cameras. To remote view you enter in a web address (ip address), type in your user name and password, and you can view your cameras. Dynamic IP addresses are free, so there should be no extra monthly fee - just your high speed internet. Ask whether multiple people can view the cameras remotely at the same time.
 If you choose, you can set up your DVRs to record on motion, to prolong the storage of the video on the hard drive. If preferred, you can record 24/7 all the time. You can record on schedule. All video channels have an address that you assign Such as (Outside Front Yard) and is time and date stamped and video is digitally watermarked to prevent video and/or evidence tampering.
 Also, it is important to have a good amount of video storage (ex. 250 gigabyte Hard Drive, 500 gigabyte Hard Drive, 1 Terabyte Hard Drive. Generally speaking, the longer video storage, the better. With H.264 compression digital video recorders, you will notice large hard drives are included for plenty of storage time. H.264 is the "state of the art" in the Surveillance Industry. And don't worry, after the hard drive is filled with video, the DVR simply loops around and starts from the beginning.
 When it comes to burning video make sure the DVR has at least one USB if you wish to burn video to a USB flash drive. Ensure that the DVRs are compatible with your PC's in the home or office. What this means to you is that you can view your camera system conveniently, with any of your computers on the network as it is compatible with Windows.
