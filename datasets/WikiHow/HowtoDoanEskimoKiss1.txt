 You will need to be very close so that your faces can touch. This is a fun way to show affection if you are already close to one another, like if you are cuddling on the couch or holding each other close.;
, Touch the tip of your nose to the tip of your partner's nose. You can leave your eyes open or closed; do whichever feels more comfortable.
 Go back and forth a few times as you rub noses - that's an Eskimo kiss!


If you're feeling very affectionate and cuddly, move forward and nuzzle your nose into your partner's cheek.
