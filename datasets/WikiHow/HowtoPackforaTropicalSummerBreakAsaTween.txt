 This will make packing easier, as you don't have to worry about giving other people room for their clothes. You may have to persuade your parents. If you are going by plane, make sure that you're suitcase is the allowed size.
 Take at least one pair of underwear for each day you're traveling, and if you wear one, a couple of bras. Two or three pairs of shorts are essential. Bring some bright t-shirts and tank tops that you can mix and match. Also, remember to bring some pajamas!

, Usually, a pair of flip-flops, sandals and a pair of sneakers will do, but you might want to bring a pair of dress shoes just in case. Don't forget socks!

, Bring shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, facial cleanser, a hairbrush and don't forget sunscreen! Also, remember deodorant. It can be hot and sweaty at the beach.
, Just take along some eye shadow, coral lipstick and gloss. Heat will clog your pores when you wear makeup, so you don't want to wear a lot. You can also find makeup that doesn't clog your pores, but it's still recommended not to wear it much.
