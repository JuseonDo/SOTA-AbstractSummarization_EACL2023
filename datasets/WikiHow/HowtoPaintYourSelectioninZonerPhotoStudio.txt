Be sure that the correct mode is selected. You will probably want the first option, which is 'Add to Selection'.
If you are selecting a large area, you will probably want to knock up the size of the brush to a diameter of about 100 or 200, initially.
Set the opacity at 0%. This makes it so where you see the brush is where it is painting.
 This way you can save the selection in case it gets messed up later. It will be saved as a transparent PNG. Note the odd bits that aren't QUITE selected. That is because the opacity was set at 50% initially.
 You can continue to paint the brush, save the selection and save it again, if you need to.
 This will allow you to get closer and closer to what you don't want to select.
