 Headaches that begin as a dull ache but become progressively worse may be migraine headaches.
 Throbbing pain on one side of the head is often a migraine. The sides of your temples and back of the neck may also be affected.
 Migraine suffers often discontinue normal activity until migraine headache symptoms disappear, usually between 4 and 72 hours.
 Did you see flashing lights, tunnel vision or blind spots? These symptoms often appear just prior to an aural migraine. Affected people may also experience tastes, tingling sensations and lapsed memory.
 Elimination diets help determine migraine causes. Weight control and regular sleep can also help reduce the chance of contracting regular migraine headaches.
