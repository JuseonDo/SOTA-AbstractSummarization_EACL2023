learn the basics first: no matter what type of music you want to play or what type of guitar you want to use, you will need to learn some basic chords, they are extremely easy to find on the net and there are many books covering this sort of thing,also, youtube has tons of videos for this.

@summary
make sure you enjoy learning.

@summary
find a buddy to play with.

@summary
don't get ahead of yourself: the chances are, if a song sounds hard to play, it probably is (not all the time though) so take it slowly, don't try to learn an entire song at once, try to learn a group of five or six chords on a song at a time, if you try to go too fast you'll only get confused and frustrated, then you'll get nowhere.

@summary
practise regularly: it's a lot easier to practise if you set a certain time to practise.

@summary
stock up on supplies.

@summary
buy a tuner.

 (YouTube guitar lessons are a great way to self teach);
, No matter how hard you try, if you don't enjoy learning, it will make it far harder. Play the music you like, most bands have at least a couple beginner songs, so try to play songs that you enjoy playing.
 It makes it a lot easier to learn if you play guitar with a buddy, you can compare tips and both play different roles in different songs (providing you have the same taste in music)e.g they could play lead and you could play rhythm, plus it is really fun to play the same song with someone.
, 45 minutes to an hour each night is good, but stop if you feel bored or tired. Start fresh the next night(or day). Its also a good Idea to keep your guitar set up so you can just pick it up and play if you have a spare couple of minutes.
 Make sure you have a good supply of picks/plectrums (if you are using a pick instead of finger picking)and make sure you always have a spare set of strings in case one snaps (nothing more annoying than not having a string)

, Having a guitar tuner is much better than trying to tune by ear, they are much easier to use and take much less time, it is very annoying if tuning by ear does not work, I was close to smashing a guitar over it.
