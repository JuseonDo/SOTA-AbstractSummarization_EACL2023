 Use a large spoon and stir until ingredients are well integrated.;
, Especially if you find that your ingredients are more liquid; leaving the bowl in the refrigerator will help them bind and combine.
 Use the wax paper surface to work on your snowman––that way the cheese and other ingredients won’t stick to your counters and spoil the snowman shape.
 Depending on the kind of snowman you’d like to create, you could form three evenly shaped balls or you could create “snowballs” in descending order with the smallest being the snowman’s head.
 For best results, pour cheese into a separate plate, which will provide you with enough room to roll and coat each ball evenly.
, Consider adding a large leaf of lettuce as the snowman’s bed for garnish. Surround the snowman with creative looking crackers or bread. (Some specialty shops create crackers in holiday-themed or winter shapes.)

, Leaving this dish on the counter for a long period of time may encourage spoilage.
