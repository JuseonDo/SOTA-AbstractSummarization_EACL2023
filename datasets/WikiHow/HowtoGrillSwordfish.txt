 A marinade can consist of a variety of ingredients depending on your preferences. Start with combination of liquids such as Teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, wine vinegar, fresh lemon juice, salad dressing, tomato sauce or ketchup. A bit of honey or brown sugar adds a sweet flavor. If you prefer a fiery marinade, try chili powder or Tabasco sauce. A small amount oil such as butter or olive oil mixed in the marinade prevents the swordfish steaks from sticking to the grill. If your prefer to grill your swordfish steaks without marinade, just sprinkle the steaks with your choice of seasonings. A squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice brings out the subtle flavor of the swordfish.;
, Turning the steaks occasionally will ensure that the steaks are evenly covered with marinade. You can also marinade the swordfish steaks in a resealable plastic bag.
 Brush the steaks with oil before seasoning to prevent sticking. A drizzle of fresh lemon juice or lime juice accentuates the subtle flavor of the fish.
 Medium to high heat is best for swordfish. Brushing the grill generously with oil before grilling will help to prevent them from sticking to the grill. If you use a marinade, the extra marinade can be brushed on the steaks. If you prefer, simply season the steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper or your choice of seasonings.
 Swordfish steaks grill in approximately 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. Don't overcook the swordfish, as too long on the grill will dry it out.
 Use fresh parsley or a few sprigs of rosemary along with fresh lemon slices or a sprinkle of chopped green onions. You can also make extra marinade and serve it as a dipping sauce, or serve the fish with mayonnaise or salad dressing.
