,,  Do you  want a full presentation with a soundtrack or talking? If the booth is unmanned, this may be a great option. On the other hand, if the video or slideshow has sound, you may be forced to talk over it, which can be difficult if the volume is too loud.
 You can use a PC tablet or iPad to collect visitor contact information, host a fishbowl drawing with business cards, or sponsor a raffle.
 This can be as personal as a phone call, or as simple as an email blast.
