 You will need a proportion as follows:


Approximately 1 cup sugar to half cup oil.
Always measure out a little extra because the oils sink into the sugar and it gets compacted.
 Mix together.
 Continue adding the extract until you get the scent you want (this means giving it a good sniff every few drops).
 Label it and you are done.
