 Name the new key "Google."

, Name the new key "Update."

, Name the new DWORD "UpdateDefault."

, This will open a new window.
 Click "OK" to save it., Chrome will no longer automatically download and install updates.
 It is highly recommended that you manually apply updates as they become available to help protect your computer's security. To check for updates, open the Chrome menu and select "Help" → "About Google Chrome." If updates are available, you'll be prompted to install them.


You can re-enable automatic updates by going back into the Registry Editor and removing the DWORD you created.
