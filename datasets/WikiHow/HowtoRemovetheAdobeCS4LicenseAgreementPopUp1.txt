 This will be the quickest way to open the correct folder.;
, This will open the folder for your Adobe program.
 For example, if you're trying to remove the license agreement from Photoshop CS4, open the "Photoshop" folder in the "App" folder.
 This is the file that controls the appearance of the license agreement.


Note: This only works in CS4 and earlier.
 This will allow you to change the file name.
 This will turn the file into a backup so that it isn't deleted, but will keep it from being run by the program.
 When you launch your Adobe program again, you should be able to skip right past the license agreement.
 If you use multiple Adobe programs, you'll need to repeat these steps in each program's "App" folder.
