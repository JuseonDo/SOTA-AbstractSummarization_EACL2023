 It is really easy, just find a suitable tree, not way too wide, but not thin like a birch. White pines work well.;
, Don't use trash, since gnomes are very protective of the environment. Also don't break sticks off of live trees or destroy animal habitats.
 It should consist of sticks leaning against a tree.
 Some options for insulation are pine needles and leaves.
 This is optional, but it makes the home look good.
