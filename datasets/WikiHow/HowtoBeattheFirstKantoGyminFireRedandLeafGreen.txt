 It is Brock, so you must be prepared for a Geodude and Onix.;
, Is it only your starter? If you chose Charmander, you either will want to train another Pokémon to help, or train Charmander to lv.14 where it learns Metal Claw. Pidgey and Ratatta will be no help, so you might want to try a bug like Butterfree that you can evolve at an early level. If you have Bulbasaur or Squirtle, this gym will be a breeze.
, If you have any starter but Charmander, don't bother with status reducing moves {i.e. growl, leer}. Absorb and Water Gun should one-hit-KO the Geodude. With his Onix, now try Leer to lower the defense of the Onix, then come in for the kill.
