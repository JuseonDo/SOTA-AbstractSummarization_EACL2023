,, Before printing, choose "Paperless printer" instead of your regular printer that you would use to print. This should be at the top window that pops up.
 When you select print, paperless printer will read the document, and then a small window will pop up, asking you what you would like to save it as.
 Another page will pop up, telling other information. Don't do anything on that window.
 Click cancel.
 Search for a folder named "paperless printer". Voila! Your document should be there. Now all you have to do is place the image in your PSP or iPod for viewing.
