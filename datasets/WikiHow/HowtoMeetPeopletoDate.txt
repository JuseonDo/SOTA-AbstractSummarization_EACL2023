@summary
gather a task squad (this can be just you and a friend or you and a group of friends).

@summary
prepare.

@summary
go somewhere where people gather to talk, whether it's a pub or a comic convention!,

@summary
get out and talk to people.

@summary
just repeat the above, never try to push further from your end, but always respond, if they ask a question, or follow their answer to your question with a question, then respond.

@summary
we now need to up the ante a bit - take the conversation to the next level - you should now be proficient in the meet & greet stage of obtaining a date, if not repeat the above until you are.

@summary
,

@summary
so, you have said hello, asked if they are having a good night, you have pre-qualified the person, you like the way they look and they seem approachable.

@summary
from here your natural conversation skills can kick in, conversation is as simple abc.

@summary
once you find yourself in the flow of conversation, you need to add assertion to your game: "it has been great talking, can i have your phone number/blackberry pin/email address?",

@summary
so by now you should be sat at home after your night out, with updated contact information on your phone or a scribble on a piece of paper - you are probably asking "when should i contact them?",

@summary
if you met on a friday night, a casual text message on the sunday afternoon would be appropriate "hi, its insert name from the pub, nice meeting you on friday, i hope you had a good evening.",

@summary
you need to spend the next 5 - 10 text messages reigniting that initial spark - refresh their memory as to why they were speaking to you in the first place.

@summary
,

@summary
now you need to pop the question, no not marriage, you need to propose a meet-up.

@summary
date prep should be the same as before, groomed, clean teeth, look fresh, feel fresh.

@summary
so you are here, you have achieved what not so long ago seemed the impossible.

@summary
the kiss?
@article
 They need to play no part, it's best to be around people you enjoy being with as this will help you feel at ease.;
, Clothes, hair, aftershave, teeth - nothing over the top, dress appropriately, comfortable a must! 4 sprays of aftershave - behind each ear and on each shoulder. Nothing extreme, no bright colors, relaxed approach (unless you are heading somewhere which requires this).
 People go to these places knowing there are going to be other people there. They are prepared to TALK.
 You are not trying to pull tonight, you are still in training. With a pub as a scenario, don't hang outside the toilets waiting for your prey! Instead - go solo at the bar (this may sound scary, but this way no pressure, your friends can sometimes be off putting). When ordering drinks, look around casually, if you make eye contact with someone - SMILE but then turn away, remember these are skill building techniques. Spot someone of interest next to you - say hi, if you are given a positive response then follow with "having a good evening?" again, if their reaction is positive then "Okay cool, catch you later".
 This will happen naturally, we as humans are designed for conversation, it's a natural occurrence regardless of our physical appearance.
, Now all you have to do is simply add to the conversation: (Ex. "so, are you going to a bar or club after here?" or "Let me get this drink for you")

, The thing you have to remember at this stage is, if its not going too well then there is a compatibility issue, when you find the right person, you WILL click.


, The answer is variable - you need to strike a balance between " I'm not a stalker & hard to get" Basically not to soon and not too late. My recommendation is as follows:

, DO NOT ask for a date right now

,, If you are a guy asking a girl, remember this can be delicate - I would recommend the initial meeting place to be the same venue as when you first met - the reason for this is it's a familiar place to your date and will help to make them feel at ease.
 Pre date nerves - don't worry, they will feel exactly the same!

, Remember you have one the hard part, this is now easy, you have clicked already, you have spoken, now you use this time to get to know each other. Make sure you show interest in your date, combine talking about yourself to asking questions about them and it should work both ways.
 That's down to you and your date how quickly you'd like to progress things. Just go with the flow, the combination of two people is a natural occurrence and the first kiss is included, you will both know when the time is right.
