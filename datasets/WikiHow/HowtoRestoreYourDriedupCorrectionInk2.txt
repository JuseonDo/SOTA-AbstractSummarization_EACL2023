 Sometimes, it's just a thin layer of ink that has dried over the nib, and the ink inside the pen is just fine.
 If there is dried ink covering the nib, use your fingernail to gently scratch the ink off. A thin layer of dried ink can prevent fresh ink from flowing out.
 This will help dislodge any blockage that is inside the ink. Once you have given the pen a few shakes, try drawing with it and seeing if any ink comes out.
 This may require you to remove the top and bottom sections, depending on how the pen is designed. Use something long and thin, such as a knitting needle or a chopstick to remove the clot.
 You can use a few drops of water or a non-acetone nail polish remover.
 If the ink inside the pen has mostly dried out and you can't restore it, you can try pouring in fresh correction ink. Get a bottle of white correction ink, and pour a little bit into the pen capsule.
 If necessary, seal any parts that don't stay together with super glue.
 Sometimes, a correction ink pen won't write simply because the little ball in the tip is stuck. You can loosen it in two ways:


Draw circles with it in a small puddle of olive oil or baby oil.
Soak the tip in a cup of warm water for about 10 minutes.
