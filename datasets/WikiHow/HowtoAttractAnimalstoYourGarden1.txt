 Birds like to get a bath and will often drink from the bath. Add some flat rocks to your bird bath, so butterflies have a place to light and get a drink as well.;
, This can also be used by Bats at night.
 Or make a peanut butter log to hang for woodpeckers and some of the larger birds. Your garden will become home to lots of different types of Birds if you do this.
 Take pictures when their eating!
