 If at all possible, it is a good idea to have a backup. If you have some type of mechanical or power failure, you will not be able to take any pictures without a backup.;
, Your camera may have that and if you are used to using that on camera flash, then use it. If you believe that you need the strobe for the effects that you want, then be sure to bring that.
 Having to buy those supplies may be a difficult proposition in an unfamiliar locale.
 Depending on the location, you can decide ahead of time which ones to bring.
 Your camera might have one internally or you may not even use one. If you do, put some thought into if you will need it. It is, potentially, one more piece to lose.
, This is an easy way of getting pictures out of your camera.
 There are small tripods that will fit in your luggage, monopods, or something that will help hold your camera steady.
 If you bring a digital camera, it is very handy to be able to upload the pictures to something so that you can take even more.
 That way you can set it up ahead of time. Also, you will want to investigate if that is even a viable option for your destination.
