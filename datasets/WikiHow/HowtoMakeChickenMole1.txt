 Toast them in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 2 minutes.;
, Soak until they are softened (should take about 30 minutes).
 Then grind them in a spice grinder and add the powder to a blender.
 Then add the tomatoes. Cook vegetables until they are soft (this should take 10-15 minutes). Then add them to the blender.
 You should also pour in some of the water that the chilies and raisins were soaked in.
 Add more of the water used to soak the raisins and chiles as needed to make a smooth sauce.


this will make about 4 cups of mole. The recipe calls for two cupsâ€”the leftovers can be frozen and reused at another time.
