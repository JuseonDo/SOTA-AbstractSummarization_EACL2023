 Self reliance is the key to independence.;
, Take time to figure out your goal and where you are headed. Your choices will determine the rest of your life. This is not about actual travel; it is about getting your head on straight so you can reach your goals. Many have lost their way and are going in the wrong direction. Don't be swayed by other people’s bias.
 It just swims in circle all day without a care. It’s like a rocking chair that gives you something to do but gets you nowhere.
 Point yourself in the right direction and start moving that way even though it means hard work. Reaching your goal may require hard work.
 If you have lost your way, look for help from others who have arrived at your destination and put forth the effort. 

, Move in the right direction one foot at a time.
 It could be to a foreign place or even a distant country.
 You will miss them but they may not be happy where you go.
  Listen to the description in your head map of where you want to arrive.
 Many may take the easy route because they do not want to make the effort. That approach does not suit you.
 Many of the most beautiful views are at the highest levels.
 Living a life that is not the real you will only make you unhappy. Once you embrace who you really are others will embrace you also. This is because you will shine with confidence.
 This is important and it means use your head.
 Usually you can make a big U-turn on the road of life and go back the other way. Life is full of choices and changes that’s what makes it a great adventure.
