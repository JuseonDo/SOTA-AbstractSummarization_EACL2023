, For example, touch her shoulder and say "Look at that! I can't believe it!" or grab her hand and say "Wait! Over here!"

, For example, brush her hair, say "Your hair used to be a total mess, seems like it is much better now", and smile a little. Make it sincere, say something that is only true. But no cheesy things, that works only if she liked you already.
, That tells her that it's okay to be in your personal space. Try putting your arm around her shoulders. If she snuggles closer or doesn't pull back, you know you've gotten past the stage where physical contact is awkward. You may also want to (very lightly) "bump" into her. This is especially effective if you're sitting beside her or walking beside her.
 Tickling sends the same signals as pain, so be sure she's the kind of girl that doesn't mind. .
 Be sure to give it back so your plan doesn't backfire! You don't want a slap as physical contact!
