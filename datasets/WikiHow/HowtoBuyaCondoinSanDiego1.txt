Talk to lenders in San Diego about what kind of mortgage you will qualify for. A conventional mortgage might be best for a condo purchase.
Discuss whether a government-backed loan such as a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veteran's Administration (VA) loan will work. Both agencies FHA have implemented strict guidelines that make it more difficult for borrowers to qualify for these loans when they are buying a condo.
 This program includes condo purchases.


Borrow up to $35,000 or 33 percent of the condos purchase price (whichever is less) if you are a low-income first time homebuyer. The County of San Diego offers these low interest loans to help with your down payment or closing costs.
