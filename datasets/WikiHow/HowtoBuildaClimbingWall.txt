Drill 6 holes, 1/4 inch (.635 cm) deep, at 3 inch (7.62 cm) intervals starting 8 inches (20.32 cm) from the bottom, up the middle of the board.
Lay another one of the 12 foot (365.76 cm) 2 inch by 4 inch (5.08 cm by 10.16 cm) lumber flat on the ground. Drill 6 more 1/4 inch (.635 cm) holes at 3 inch (7.62 cm) intervals starting 8 inches (20.32 cm) from one end, up the middle of the board, stopping 8 inches from the other end. This is board B.
Run a 1/4 inch (.635 cm) bolt through the end hole of board B into the bottom hole in the side stud of the climbing frame and fasten with a nut. Board A should point away from the front of the climbing wall.
Run a 1/4 inch (.635 cm) bolt through the end hole on the opposite end of Board B in to the single hole on Board A (not 1 of the 6 holes at the opposite end of the board) and fasten with a nut.
Run a 1/4 inch (.635 cm) bolt through the end hole on the opposite end of Board A in to the hole at the top of the climbing panel and fasten with a nut. The completed brace should form a triangle.



When supports braces are attached to both sides, the climbing wall should be standing on its own.
 This will adjust the pitch of the wall without disassembling and reassembling the support braces.
