 You should not see the pad or tampon sticking out of the pocket. This way, if you have to use the restroom, all you have to do is put on your coat.


If your pocket has a zipper, zip it shut so that the pad or tampon doesn't accidentally peek out.
 Keep in mind that this only works with sweatshirts and shirts that had tighter sleeves. It won't work on loose, flowing sleeves.
 If you like to wear boots, you can always tuck a pad or tampon inside them. Pads will fit most comfortably in fitted, lace-up boots. Tampons may fit inside bulky, slip-on boots. You may need to tuck the tampon under your sock to keep it from rattling around, however.
 Most pads will fit completely inside the pocket, and won't stick out. If they are thin enough, they also won't create any suspicious bulk., When you go to the restroom, bring the lipstick tube with you. People will assume that you are just going to reapply your lipstick.


Keep in mind that this only works if you are wearing lipstick that day.
You can clean out empty lipstick tubes using soap, water, and lots of q-tips., Keep in mind that pads will need to be rolled or folded to fit.


If you wear glasses, you can try hiding tampons in there as well.
 Most people won't open up your mug to see what's inside of it; they will assume that it is coffee or tea. Use this mug only for tampon/pad hiding purposes.
