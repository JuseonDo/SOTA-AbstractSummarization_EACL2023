 Pick one that you really like to increase the chances that you'll finish it. Sets come in many different varieties of subject matter: birds, flowers, seaside scenes, woodland scenes, cartoon characters, automotive themes.;
, Cover the area with old newspapers or newsprint to keep it clean. If you can station this area in a room with a washable floor, that would be most beneficial.
 Use a cup you don't usually drink from or one that can be washed thoroughly. A paper cup is fine. Disposable food containers also work well, for example, a used yogurt container. Also, stock the area with some rags.
, This should be clearly marked on the paint containers.
, The rag will come in handy as you will need to remove some of the water from the brush after washing.
 Repeat with a new color until you have painted every area and the painting is totally dry.
 If you like how your painting turned out, frame your creation or mat it, and hang it on your wall.
