 This means, stop using the transpose button gradually, until not using it becomes the new normal for you.;
, It is helpful to write out these tools using solfa notation, as this will make it easy to transcribe to other keys.
 Choose one key per week, then at the end of the week, rehearse everything you have practiced. Note the difference between practice time and rehearsal time. In practice time, you are learning new material, while in rehearsal time, you are revising the material you already learnt.
 Also, when practicing, be sure to have your fingers as relaxed as possible, as this would help improve on speed and accuracy, though much focus should be placed on accuracy

, What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
 For example, if you are learning Key C on a certain week, move over to Key F or Key G the next week. The reason for this is because keys a perfect fourth interval apart are very much similar, with a difference of only one extra black note. For example, if you're moving from Key C to Key F, there is only one added black note which is A#.
 Include all the inversions of the key you're learning.
 Practice their inversions of the key.
 Examples are the 2-5-1, 7-3-6, 7-3-6-2-5-1, b5-7-3, and 5-1-4.
 In about two months, with some level of discipline and consistency, you should be able to break out of the transpose comfort zone.
