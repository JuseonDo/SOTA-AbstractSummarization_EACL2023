 Place the box on top of your fabric and use your fabric pencil to trace the bottom. Add an extra inch into your measurement for best results.
, Measure for both width and height. Transfer measurements to your fabric using the measuring tape and fabric pencil. Repeat this step until all four sides have been measured and drawn on the fabric.
 Before you cut lay the fabric next to the inside of your box to make sure that you are correct with your measurements and the fabric strip will fit the space and provide some overhang.
 Don’t over glue, but make sure you have enough so that it doesn’t move.
 Don’t glue the remaining three to five inches or overhang.


Glue the side to the inside of the box and allow the overhang piece to lay over the top. You will glue that into place last.
Repeat until all four sides are glued into place.
 Make sure the overhang fabric is folded evenly all the way around and secure with craft glue.


Glue the fabric underneath to itself and then use spray adhesive to join the fabric to the exterior box side.
