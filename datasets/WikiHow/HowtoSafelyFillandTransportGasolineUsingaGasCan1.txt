,, Approved gas cans are red and have a marking stating their intended use for gasoline.
 Static electricity can build up and cause a spark, igniting the gas fumes. Release any static electricity in your body collected from being in the car by touching a metal part of the car, possibly the car door, as you exit the vehicle.
 Never fill a gas can that is located inside a vehicle or in the bed of a truck. The can is not grounded from electrical charge if it is in a vehicle. Bed liners and mats in truck beds negate the grounding of static charges.
, If there is a spark, you don't want it at the opening where it could ignite fumes in the can.
 Do not set the lock latch on the pump handle. Pay attention and pull the trigger manually.
 Leave a couple inches of space for fume expansion due to temperature changes. This will also help thwart spills and overflow.
, If you do not have a cloth, look for one provided by the gas station at the window washing station.
