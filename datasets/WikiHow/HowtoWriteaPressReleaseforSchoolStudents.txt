 A press release should answer the following questions:


Who was / is involved?
What happened / will happen?
When did it / will it happen?
Where did it / will it happen?
How did it / will it happen? ('How?' is not always relevant.);
, Do this in one or two sentences of the first paragraph.
 This will be the material which reporters can use in an article.
 Also provide some brief background information about your group:


who you are;
what your objectives are; and
what you have already accomplished.
 So press releases are most effective when they announce something new, deal with something that is topical, or provide 'human interest' — personal stories that will get people’s attention.
 This is so that reporters can get in touch with you to find out more if they want to.
 Find out the name of the news editor, producer or specialized correspondents and gather contact information and other details. This will mean you can ‘issue’ your press release to the right people.
 Give reporters as much notice as you can, and then remind them the day before the event.
