 Get a rag wet and splotch water all over the paper you plan to dye. Allow excess water to drop off into a sink.

, Use squirt bottlesto create blotches of color and spray bottlesto create larger spatters of color. Make sure you mix the appropriate amount of water with your dyes according to their directions.
 You might cover a table or counter top with several layers of newspaper or place your paper in a large, shallow tin. You can even complete the activity on the ground outside, weather permitting.


It's also a good idea to protect your clothes by wearing a smock, apron or old t-shirt.
 There's no right or wrong way to apply the color, just use your imagination. Use various colors for a true tie-dyed look.









If you want to create symmetrical patterns, fold the paper in half before applying the color.
 The liquid dye will run and and bleed across the wet paper. You can twist the paper as it drips to create further designs.
 If you chose to fold the paper, unfold it, then lay the paper down flat on a towel. Let the paper air dry for at least 30 minutes.
