 Do not use baby diapers for your dog, but do use diapers designed to fit a dog. You can purchase dog diapers at a pet store or Walmart.;
, Baby wipes are the only safe item that can have a dual usage for humans as well as dogs and can be used in a variety of situations.
 If your dog has a cropped tail so much that the tail is almost unnoticeable, cover the hole up with tape before applying the diaper on the dog to prevent leakage.
 Much like a human disposable diaper, dog disposable diapers have tapes on them that will help secure to the dog for a comfortable fit and help hold the diaper to the dog (However, unlike a human diaper that has it's tapes designed for securing in front, dog diapers have just the opposite due to the format of the dog's posterior end and the ease of use of the product for a more natural fit.)

, Keep your hand curved so that the diaper tapes on the dog diaper stick outwards.
