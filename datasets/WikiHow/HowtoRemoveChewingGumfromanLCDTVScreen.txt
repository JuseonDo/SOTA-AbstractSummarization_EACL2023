 Check your owner's manual for recommended products and methods to use on your LCD TV screen before contemplating any non-conforming approach––bear in mind that if you are still under warranty, using another product will likely void it.

You might want to read the "Warnings" section below first before attempting to "do it yourself" and remove the chewing gum from your LCD TV screen.;
, (Make sure your hands are dry when you unplug and plug back in your TV LCD screen.) Wait for a few minutes until the unit cools down to room temperature before working on the chewing gum.
 Do not use ordinary tap water as it may leave a residue on your LCD screen.
 Make sure to moisten only, not wet the cloth. Do not spray directly on the LCD screen.
 The vinegar will dissolve or soften the chewing gum, making it easier to remove. Try to blot only the gum and not the surface of your LCD TV screen.
 You may need to repeat the blotting and wiping process a lot of times to completely remove the chewing gum from the surface of the LCD TV screen. Use a new cloth or at least a new clean section of your cloth every time. During the whole removal process, remember not to press too hard on the cloth and not to put too much pressure on the screen. LCD screens are quite soft and pressure can spoil that part of the screen permanently.
 Do not plug back in until you are sure it has dried.
