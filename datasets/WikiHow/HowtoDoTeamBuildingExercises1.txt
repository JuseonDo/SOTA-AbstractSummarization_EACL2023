use a team building game that asks children to guide one another.

 As they cooperate with teammates, they help one another to win a game or complete a task.;
, For example, working in pairs, each child can guide his/her blindfolded teammate to find objects that are scattered throughout the room.


Ask children to talk about what made the game challenging or fun. Guide them to use words that focus more on their feelings than what another child did or didn't do.
