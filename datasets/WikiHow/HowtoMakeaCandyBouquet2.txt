 Get a Styrofoam block that is about the size of a brick and glue a box of candy around each of its four sides. Put the glue on the block and then stick the boxes to the glue. Using boxes of candy like Hot Tamales or the boxed M&Ms or Sno-Caps you can find at the movies are perfect for covering the Styrofoam block. Turn the box sideways, so the long way is facing up, and make sure that the top and bottom do not have candy bars glued to them., Glue a variety of candy bars, like Snickers, Hershey's, Crunch bars, or Butterfingers, to popsicle sticks so that about 2 inches (5 cm) of the popsicle stick is glued to the candy bar.
 Once the glue on the Styrofoam block has dried, you can stick the popsicle sticks into the top of the block so that the candy bars are evenly spaced.
 Glue some tissue paper around the top edge of the block so that all of the Styrofoam is covered and the candy block has a more bouquet-like feel.
