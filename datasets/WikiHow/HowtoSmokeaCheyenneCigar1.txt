cut off the filter for a fuller body.although you may want to hold off on this unless you're an experienced cigar smoker, cutting off the filter at the end of a cheyenne cigar will allow the tastes and material to enter your mouth more directly.

 Remove the cellophane wrapper encasing the pack and open up the lid. Dispose of the cellophane in the garbage once you've removed it completely.


You should be able to smell the cigars upon removing the cellophane.;
, In terms of lighters, a torch lighter is your best option, because it will allow the cigar tip to burn thoroughly.


Placing the cigar directly in the flame will hurt the cigar's flavour.
 While the cigar is lit, inhale on the reverse tip of your chosen cigar. Inhale slowly until smoke begins to billow from the lit tip. Inhale the smoke into your mouth, but don't let it get in your lungs, or you'll cough violently.
 After taking a puff from the cigar, let the flavour linger and enjoy it. When it subsides, take another puff.


Because Cheyenne cigars are small, you won't get the same body from it as you would with a typical cigar.
 Cigars are often packed with strong smells, and exhaling through your nose will open up the sensory experience.
 When white smoke begins to bellow from the tip, it will burn on its own and you shouldn't feel rushed to finish it.


If the cigar loses its fire, you can always relight it.
 Instead, roll the cigar end around the floor of the ashtray until the tip breaks off. You shouldn't be worried about constantly breaking off the cigar, as a long ash is a sign of a good cigar. However, you should dispose of it before it gets long to the point of snapping.
 Although this is certainly less healthy, it does have the effect of making the body (or "smoke feel") of your cigar a lot bolder.
