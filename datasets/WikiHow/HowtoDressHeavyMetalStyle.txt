 A good choice is to try Black/Blue Jeans/ Ripped Pants, Camo pants. Always avoid shaggy pants. Baggy for Nu Metal normal for most other styles.Must wear black, brown or any dark color pants.;
, Denim and leather coats for Thrash Metal and most other forms of metal ripped sleeves are good. Flannel shirts are good. Also radium T-Shirts are very popular.
 Numerous belt buckles are popular like metal skulls etc.
 These are the iconic sign that you are a true metalhead. Also cool looking belts

,, Almost every heavy metal star has long hair, so if you're comfortable with growing yours out, do it. If not, boys can also shave their hair (think Phil Labonte, Phil Anselmo, Bruce Dickinson, Kerry King, among others.)


Some places prefer you to tie your hair back, so tie it back, but be inventive, use a bandana without a bobble for a Guns 'n' Roses look, or a bandanna with a bobble for a biker look.
, For punk look, wear sneakers.
