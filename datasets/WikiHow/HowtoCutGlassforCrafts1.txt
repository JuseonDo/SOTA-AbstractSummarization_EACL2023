 A glass cutter is a small, hand-held tool that scores the glass with a sharp wheel.;
, Clean a flat surface and place a chair nearby. Keep a straight edge and sharpie on hand to help you get an accurate cut in the glass.
 You should always wear goggles when cutting glass, because an unclean break can launch shards of glass into the air.
 You should do 10 to 20 practice cuts before starting to craft your glass for the final project.


Antique glass is hand-blown and often has some bubbles inside. It is uneven and unlikely to cut well. Antique glass is also more expensive, so make sure you choose glass that is not valuable for your first glass crafts.
 You can also place the straight edge where you want to cut, if you want to avoid making a mark on your glass.
 Stand in a place where you can apply steady downward pressure.
 Apply firm pressure slowly towards you. The base of the cutter should be parallel to the glass rather than slanted.


You should hear the sound of the glass being scored. It will not cut all the way through the glass, but rather, it will make marks in the surface.
, Pick up your piece of glass.
 Your fingers should wrap around on the other side in a loose fist shape.
 Give the same amount of pressure on both sides of the score line. Your glass should snap in half cleanly.


For thicker pieces of glass, you can use glass breaking/grozing pliers. These strong pliers have a flat side and a curved side for breaking and then nipping off shards of unevenly broken glass. Place the flat side of the pliers on the smaller piece of glass and thrust upwards while you hold the rest of the glass with your opposite hand.
