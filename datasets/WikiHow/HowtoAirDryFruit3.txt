@article
 You must have several consecutive days with at least 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). Humidity should be less than 60 percent.,


Choose a screen made from plastic, stainless steel, or fiberglass coated with Teflon. These types can be safely used for fruit.
Reject screens that can leave harmful deposits on food or alter food's nutritional value. Don't use screens constructed with aluminum, copper, or metal cloth covered with zinc or cadmium.
Avoid wood trays made with cedar, green wood, oak, pine, or redwood. These will taint the flavor or discolor the fruit.



Place metal sheeting on the ground. Aluminum or tin will reflect sunshine and raise the drying temperature.
Select a concrete surface if metal sheeting is unavailable. A concrete patio without a roof or a paved driveway will suffice. A concrete surface is drier than soil, which will allow the fruit to dry more quickly.
, This will allow air to circulate around the fruit.
 Arrange the fruit in 1 layer. Leave space in between the pieces so they don't touch.
 This will keep out bugs, birds, and debris.
 You will turn the fruit every 2 hours while it's drying in the sun.
 You don't want your fruit in the damp, cool air after the sun goes down.

Slice some of the fruit pieces in half. You should not see any moisture nor be able to squeeze out any moisture.
Bend the fruit. It should not adhere to itself or be sticky.
