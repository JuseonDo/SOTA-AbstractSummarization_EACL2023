Don't limit yourself to the type of work you have always done.
Consider taking a job doing something that you always thought you might like to do.
Temporary jobs are a great way to try out new types of work without making long-term commitments.



Take classes to learn new skills that your new job would require or take refresher classes if you haven't used a skill set in a while.
Get current with technology if you have fallen behind. Know how to use basic computer software programs, as well as field-specific technology.



Take the emphasis off of your age by removing some of the dates from your resume. Most job applicants over the age of 40 do not include their graduation dates on their resumes.
Remove old employment history that is not relevant to the type of job you are trying to get.



Check online job posting sites as well as industry-related sites and forums for job listings.
Network among the business relations you built over your years of employment to get the word out that you are looking for a temporary job.
Apply at companies you would like to work at even if they aren't currently advertising position openings. There could be something open that hasn't been advertised, or they may hold your resume for when a position does open.
 Do not dress to look young, but dress to look good. Looking good will also increase your confidence.
 Think about your skills and how they would transfer to benefit your new employer.
, Although many agencies have primarily office work, some agencies branch out into other fields.
 Even in a tight job market, temporary jobs are always available.
