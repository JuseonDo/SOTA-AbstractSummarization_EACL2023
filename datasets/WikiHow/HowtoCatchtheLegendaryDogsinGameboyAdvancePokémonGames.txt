encounter them: the first step would be to encounter them, as to get them in your pokedex, or your pokegear, if you're playing heartgold or soulsilver.

@summary
buy items: the next step would be to get the proper amount of pokeballs and potions, because the dogs and latis all have a catch rate of 3, meaning your chances of catching them on your first ball are very slim, and they can really damage you, possibly thwarting that attempt at catching them.

 When you find them, just let them run, or, if you're already prepared, skip to step 10.;
,, You'll find out why soon enough.
, While holding an Everstone, a Pokémon has a high chance of passing on it's nature to the baby Pokémon. Eventually, you will get an egg, and then soon after, a baby Eevee, hopefully with the correct nature. Sometimes, this will take multiple attempts. Don't get down, just carry a Pokémon with Magma Armor or Flame Body abilities in your party to cut the egg hatching time in half.
 But, don't evolve it until after Eevee gets to be level 36, so it will learn Baton Pass, which is crucial. Then train it up to level 57 so it will learn Mean Look, and have the Ability Synchronize, so the opponent Pokémon is likely to have the same Nature as you.
 Mime and Drowzee. Find or trade a female Mr. Mime or Mime Jr. to your game, and then get yourself a male Drowzee. Make sure Drowzee knows Hypnosis, and then put them both in the daycare. Eventually, you'll end up with a Mr. Mime that knows Hypnosis. Although, that alone won't do. Make absolutely certain that the Mr. Mime from the egg has the ability Soundproof. This is absolutely crucial!

, EV train the Mr. Mime in it's Defense and Special Defense stats, so it will last longer. Train it up to level 46 so it will learn Baton Pass, which isn't really crucial, but it helps.
 If it learns it from leveling up though, just save your money.
 Max Repels won't be very effective with this strategy, but somehow a running Pokémon is always the second or third Pokémon people encounter in that route, Max Repel or not. Track them in your Pokedex or Pokegear to find them in the same route, and make sure your Pokémon in the first slot of your party is your False Swiping Pokémon. Then just Swipe them, and repeat this step until only a small portion of their health is left. Now, your False Swipe Pokémon has done it's job.
 Then, use Mean Look. The target will have wasted that turn trying to run, and you'll have trapped it. Now, on your next turn, use Baton Pass, and pass to Mr. Mime, with the Soundproof ability. This will keep them from being able to Roar you away, and you will have Hypnosis to put them to sleep.
 Once they're down to a sliver of health and sound asleep, begin bombarding them with Ultra Balls and, depending on your level, Level Balls. Dusk Balls work well at night, and keep some Timer Balls on hand, too, because this could take a long time.
 You'll eventually catch the target with the desired nature, and then you can begin EV training it to battle your friends, or to use in the Battle Tower, or just for your Pokedex.
