 The team designated as "Team 1" will be the first to bid., That team takes possession of Pictionary Man and enters its bid by pressing the smaller button on the figure's underside once for each subject they've bid (3 times to identify 3 subjects, for example)., This person will be Picturist for all clues. The Picturist presses the large button to see the first subject and to see each subsequent subject after the preceding subject has been guessed correctly.

Skipping or passing subjects during a Challenge round is not permitted.
 If the team fails to guess all the subjects, the other team then has 20 seconds to guess another subject in the category. If the other team succeeds, they earn the 2 points., The first team to score 15 or more points wins.
