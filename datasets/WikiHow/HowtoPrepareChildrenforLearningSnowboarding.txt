 There are too many risks involved for younger children and they're not able to understand or avert the potential dangers.;
, Ski or ice hockey gear is appropriate for protecting your little snowboarder. Ask at the retail store for appropriate sizing. The helmet should fit very well.


Get a ski or snowboarding helmet, protective goggles, elbow and kneepads.

Teach your child how to identify and avoid obstacles such as trees, rocks, etc.
Talk to your child about how it feels to fall over and what to do to get up again.
 Unless you're a very confident snowboarder with a lot of patience, it is a good idea to find a reputable and registered instructor to teach your child. Ensure that the instruction is adequate.
 If family members are able to snowboard already, always ensure that one family member takes the time to remain on the easier slope with the learner child so that the child doesn't feel left out or tempted to chase everyone else.
