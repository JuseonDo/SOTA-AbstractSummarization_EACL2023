 Larger strips of peel work better for dry preserving.Use the remaining lemon fruit for juice. See Making and Freezing Lemon Juice, below.
Save the pith for pectin by freezing in a plastic bag., The volume of your mason jar minus the volume of your lemon peel is the approximate volume of salt/sugar mixture you will need.The volume will change depending on the size of mason jar you are using.
 These are spices that will break down and diffuse into the sugar/salt/lemon mixture., Repeat layers, to top., Since you have only peel in this mixture, the sugar and salt work together to break down the skin and to preserve it, without making it overly salty or overly sweet.
 Preserving this way, the lemon peel should be able to keep for up to one year in the refrigerator.


Note the date and label the mason jar.
