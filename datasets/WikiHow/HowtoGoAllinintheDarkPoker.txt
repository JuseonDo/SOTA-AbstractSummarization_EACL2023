 This play is simply playing all of your stack without looking at your cards.  If this play succeeds, you either win whatever chips are on the table from your opponent folding or calling.  And if this play fails, your opponent calls, wins the pot; and you are out of chips and eliminated.
, Cover the screen, with your hand, where your hole cards, the community cards and the chat box. Do not follow any part of the play of this hand; and for good reason. You do not want to be influenced by what you saw despite the fact that the cards dealt, in future hands, are independent events., The game may be changed by your daring play. If you doubled-up with a trash hand, your opponent would be more likely to play looser., But if you were eliminated, continue on with your next Texas hold em sit and go: and be content that your play was correct., Depending on the amount of players remaining, expect to be called, with a greater frequency, with consecutive all-ins. Adjust your hand standards for this. The outcomes would be: you won the blinds or you doubled up., Expect flawed expectation of events in yourself and especially from your opponents who have not studied numbers. Strive to play totally logically and machine-like.
