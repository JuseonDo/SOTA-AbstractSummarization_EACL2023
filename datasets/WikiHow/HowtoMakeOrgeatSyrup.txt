Almond Meal can be found at most grocery stores in the baking section and is made from ground, blanched almonds. Alternatively, you can make your own almond meal from blanched almonds ground up yourself with a rolling pin.;

Use cheesecloth if you have it. Alternatively, you can use a (clean) t-shirt.

 The rose water is optional.


You can substitute vodka for brandy.
You can substitute rose water for orange flower water.
