 This is great for leather collars that have taken a swim with Fido in stinky water.
 Remove the collar from the dog, then coat the collar with the lather.
 Remove visible grime and try to cover all of the collar to help lift the odor.
 Once rinsed, sniff the collar to see if it smells better. If not, soap and rinse again, then repeat the process until the odor is gone.
 Either lay on a towel to dry or hang it up and air dry out of direct sunlight. Hopefully the collar smells a whole lot better now!
