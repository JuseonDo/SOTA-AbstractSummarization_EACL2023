, You don't need any tools., The other bulb is bound to go soon anyway. Also you will notice the new bulb is a lot brighter than the old working one., There are 3 wires in it, but you probably can see that because of the wrapping., You should see the wires end in a female socket., Gently wiggle it and pull until it comes loose. Some guides say to now spray on some conditioner to keep it nice and supple. Sure, if you're that kind of person., Since it is black on black you'll never see this normally, but it's handy when it is time to put the plug back in., Think of it as very round U. It is hinged at the bottom so you don't have to worry it will fall out of the assembly. Squeeze the top parts together until it pops free and flaps down toward you., Pull it out. Don't throw it away yet! First practice putting it back in, then do it for real with the good bulb., There are 3 metal connectors on the back: up, left, right. Nothing facing the ground. The front face looks round at first, but actually the bottom is flat and this squashed circle will form a tight fit with the headlamp assembly., Don't get grease on it. It gets super hot and the fingerprint/grease will cook the bulb., It should fit snug and not wiggle., The bulb should now be snug even if you poke at the connectors., Remember put the "top" side top. You might find it resists and resists, but suddenly goes in easily.,
