 When you get the results of your allergy tests, ask your physician for a list of all of the names or codes of all the allergens in food that you need to avoid.;
, Add to the list as necessary and keep it on hand for reference when shopping and dining if you're not sure about a product.



Remember that additives and dyes are added mainly to food fresh longer, and to make it look more attractive and appetizing for extended periods of time. If you cook your food yourself and don't tend to keep leftovers, you don't need all these extras.
Prepare your own lunches and snacks to take to school or work instead of risking allergens in prepared food from the cafeteria.



Take some extra time at the supermarket to inspect the labels of foods you normally buy. If they list the substances that trigger your food additive and dye allergies, look for an alternative product that doesn't contain these substances.
Buy organic food products whenever you can. Though more expensive than regular products, organically-produced food carries a much lower risk of containing food additives and dyes.
, If necessary, ask to speak with the chef.
