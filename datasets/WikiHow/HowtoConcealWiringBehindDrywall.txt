@summary
start by mounting your television and television mount to the wall.

@summary
cut two holes in the drywall, one near the television and one near the a/v receiver or other audio video equipment.

@summary
fish wires from the top to the bottom (never bottom to top) that are rated for in-wall use.

@summary
install some sort of sleeve around the hole so as to give it a finished look.

@summary
mount your television and reconnect all cables.

 After doing so you will be able to remove the television and leave the mount on the wall. This will allow you to select a good spot to make a hole in the wall.;
, Make sure to use a stud finder to determine the position of the hole will be between two studs (with at least 1" of clearance on each side of the hole). After a good position is determined, make the hole using a drywall saw or reciprocating saw., It is easy to find RCA, HDMI, and speaker wire that is rated for in-wall use but more challenging to find power (IEC) cables for in-wall use., Some wall plates have an opening with brushes in it so as to minimize the sight of the wires. You can also have wall plates custom-made per the job, or see if an installation company can get you a deal on custom-made plates because of their wholesale prices., Your television should appear as if it was wireless with no unsightly cables or wires hanging down to the receiver.
