 Set a brick down in this "bed" of mortar, and tap it down with the handle of your trowel, until it is level, parallel to the line of your wall, and the edge is plumb. Repeat with 6 or 8 bricks, using the edge of the trowel to cut away the excess mortar that is shoved out from under the brick as you go.








You can put the mortar on about an inch and a half thick, and then press it down to about a finger's width. Then wipe off the excess with your finger, giving it the classic indention look that you see on brick houses.
In masonry, a course is a row of bricks.
, You can make small adjustments while the mortar is still wet, so carefully use a level to make sure that you have a good, even base to your structure. Check every 4-5 bricks for the best results.









A good, even wall comes from good, even mortar. Checking quickly will help you correct your work as you go, getting better results each time., Once you've finished the first row, clamp or nail a string between your guideposts telling you the height of the next row of bricks. You may have to adjust your guideposts slightly so that they start with your first row of bricks, but every other measurement after that should be the same.









Make sure your line is tight. You can use a level to check it's straightness.
You'll be moving this line after every course of bricks.
