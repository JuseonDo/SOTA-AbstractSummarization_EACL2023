 If you have a bunch of old candles lying around the house, then it'll be easier for you do this project. But don't worry if you don't. You can go to a thrift store and buy bags of candles that are very cheap. You could also talk to friends that you have and see about getting their old candles. Some churches give away old candles.

, It is easier if the saucepan has a pouring spout to it. You can also try to fill a pot with water and then put an old can which you will later fill with wax into it. This method will most likely not get the pot as full of wax.

Attach the end of the wick to the bottom with a drop of paraffin.
Take an old pencil or something similar that is round and long, even a straw and place it over the top of your container.
Place your wick in the middle of the container so that it drapes over the pencil.
Optionally use a piece of tape to hold the wick to the pencil.
 After the wax is completely melted, pour the melted wax into your container. Keep a little bit of the wax in the saucepan to use later. It could take from a few minutes up to a few hours for the candle wax to completely harden. Once the wax is almost completely hard, you will notice that the wax is dipped in right around the wick.
,,,, This should help the candle let go of the container and help it slide right out.
