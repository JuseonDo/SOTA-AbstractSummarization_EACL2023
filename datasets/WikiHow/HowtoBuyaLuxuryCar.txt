 You will probably have a particular kind of car in mind, but don't rule out any possibility until you have searched through what is available.;
, This will be both the easiest way to obtain your vehicle as well as the most cost-effective way to pick up the vehicle.


Check out the vehicle advertising in the local newspaper. Most dealerships will run daily advertising and possibly larger and more detailed ads in the Sunday edition of the newspaper.
Hop on the websites of local dealerships. Most will have their entire inventory listed and will let you search by make and model.
 Being willing to shop regionally will help open you up to a wider selection than what you can generally find locally.
 While searching online may turn up a vehicle that is quite far away, often times dealerships can have the cars shipped to them for you to purchase for little or no additional cost.


Brands like Cadillac or Mercedes Benz have their own websites that you can run a search through to find a dealer near you. Search their sites, and then visit the location that is within driving distance for you.



Make sure that you adjust the seats and the wheel to a comfortable position for you. Personalizing the car to your specific needs during the test drive can help you make your purchasing decision.
Take in the features and make mental pro and con notes while you are doing the test drive. This will help you weigh whether you truly want to purchase the vehicle or not.
Discuss features of the vehicle with the seller.
