 Only 700 people will be chosen from the public, but the tickets are free. They draw these registrationsÂ like the lottery. These bleachers, however, aren't actually in the Awards Show themselves so this is your best chance of attending the event.;
, Seat fillers wait by to fill any seats that are empty in the event that somebody leaves during the awards show, so when the camera looks into the audience it isn't full of holes.
 This doesn't happen very often though.
 You'd be surprised at the turn out.
