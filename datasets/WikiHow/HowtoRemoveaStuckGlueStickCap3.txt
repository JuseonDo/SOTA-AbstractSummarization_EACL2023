 Test to see if the pin is not flexible and doesn't break easily.
 Make sure the pin reaches the surface of the glue stick.
 Push hard while doing so to ensure the pin does not come out again. Break into small intervals to help the separation between the cap and glue stick.
 If the pin has snapped or has been damaged, dispose of it as it will be useless for future use.
