 Do this by lifting the rewind crank upwards. This might be a little stiff, so don't be too afraid of using a little force.,, (It may not look like it's as far as the red mark in the picture; that's because film isn't flat.), You might have to wiggle the rewind crank back or forth a little until it engages the film properly.,, Press the silver button to unlock the dial, then hold it as you turn the dial till the line is parallel with the speed of the film., Make sure the main dial is set to PROGRAM and press the shutter button; the motor drive will advance the film (if it doesn't, you're in trouble). Press it a few more times until the arrow in the frame counter window is pointing to the 1.
