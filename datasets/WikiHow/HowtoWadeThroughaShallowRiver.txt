 Do you see the trail on the other side? Do you see others' footprints or even horse tracks? What is your aiming point?;
, How steep does it descend to the river? Can you simply walk, or do you need to scramble or climb? Determine how you will get to the river's edge.
 Notice how fast it's moving and how deep it is. Judge speed by watching bits of leaves or branches floating by. Count to 60 and see how fast they pass you. If they rush past before you hit 10, the river is fast. Judge depth by looking for rocks sticking up, trees or branches lodged in the bottom and sticking up.
 Is it sand, gravel or rocks? If it's rocks, you will need to walk more carefully, hopefully with a stick for balance.
 If you see ice floating, or white sediment from glacial run-off, you know it's very cold.
 How will you get out? Will you walk, scramble or climb?

, Mark out a route in your mind. Prepare for the current moving you without your wanting to. Find various spots to aim for. Decide if you will remove your shoes or not, if you must manage your possessions to keep them dry. Tie them on if necessary, so you won't lose them if you fall.
 Be prepared if the current is pushing you sideways. Step carefully over rocks that may be slippery. Walk slowly, watching your feet, and any materials that may float down and hit you.
, Mark the entry point with something to remember it if you want.
