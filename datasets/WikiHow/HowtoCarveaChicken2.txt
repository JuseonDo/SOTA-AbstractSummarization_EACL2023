@article
 It is easiest to cut through the meat first and then work your way towards the skin, which may need to be cut with a serrated knife., The drumstick is the smaller part of the leg that is attached to the end of the leg bone. There is a thin, white fat line that runs along the joint between the drumstick and thigh.
 Repeat this process with the remaining leg.
