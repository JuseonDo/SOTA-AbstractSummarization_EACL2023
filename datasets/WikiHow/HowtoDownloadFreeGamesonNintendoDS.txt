 You can download just the games and an emulator if you want to play a game on your computer, but if you want to play the games on a DS, you'll need some extra equipment. The main thing you'll need is an R4 DS card and a microSD card. These can be easily purchased online. An adapter for the microSD will also be necessary if your computer does not have a built in slot.


Watch out for fake or knock-off R4 cards. These won't work well or sometimes at all.;
, You need to search the net for the "rom" or digital file for the game you want (for example, "Pok√©mon Black rom"). Websites like CoolRom and RomHustler are a good place to start.


Make sure the file you end up with is a .nds file.
Be aware that you cannot usually "play down" games. The game you play must be on the DS it was intended for or higher. Playing a 3DS game on a regular DS won't usually work.
 Copy the file from wherever you saved it to the card.
, This can be done like a normal game.
 You select the option to play the card, just like you would any game. You then have the choice of what game to play of those that are stored on the card. Choose which you want and play it!
