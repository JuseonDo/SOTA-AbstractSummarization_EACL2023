 Wear flip-flops, old t-shirts and loose shorts. Don't wear chains, earrings or anything like that. Avoid anything that makes it worth robbing you.;
,, If you look like you're lost and there are thugs around, the chances they mug you are greater.
 If people start talking to you (perhaps to sell something), just keep walking.


You might have to stop for directions. If you do, try to ask an elderly person, preferably a woman, because there is less of a chance an older person will try to rob or attack you.
 This can save your life.
 Don't try to act overly tough either. Just stay calm, and do whatever they ask of you. Try to leave as soon as possible., Don't run, just walk a bit fast.
 If they ask for your cell phone, just give it to them.
