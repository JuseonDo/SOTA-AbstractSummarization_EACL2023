@summary
poke a hole in the bottom of a yogurt pot and pull a string through it.

@summary
melt the lard in a pan over low heat.

@summary
spoon the mixture into the yogurt pot and wait for it to cool down.
@article
 This string should be long enough to dangle the feeder from whatever position you intend. Tie a knot in the string on the inside of the yogurt pot, such that the end of the string cannot then be pulled out.;
, Remove it from the heat once melted and stir in breadcrumbs and birdseed.
 When the mixture has gone hard, take the bird feeder outside and hang it in a tree.
