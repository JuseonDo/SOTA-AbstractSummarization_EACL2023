 Especially online. If you join (or start) an online argument, you better have an argument to bring. Play games, watch the shows, read the comics before you critique them.;
, If it's bad, it's bad. Oh well. Move on. It's easier for some, but for others, it's nearly impossible. Try focusing on the good aspects of the game (music is a good example) instead.
 If you see someone making blatant rude remarks about a Sonic couple, leave it. Let them have their own opinion. Many shipping wars are baited, anyway.
 You're not always going to agree in such a diverse fandom. Bite your tongue and leave it alone. Respect each universe and the properties contained within. You don't have to like them, just acknowledge them.
 This is a major part of why the Sonic fanbase is disliked. Educate them politely and properly, correct their mistakes, and provide proof.
 Explain to them the main game canon, its properties, story andÂ characters. If they ask about a specific universe, then proceed to go further. If you yourself are not that familiar with the series, just say, "Sorry, I'm not really the person to ask."
