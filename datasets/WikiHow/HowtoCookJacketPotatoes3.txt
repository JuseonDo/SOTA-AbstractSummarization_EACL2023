 Use a vegetable brush to scrub the potato skins thoroughly to remove any dirt. Since you won't be peeling the potatoes, it's important to get the jackets clean. Dry the potatoes thoroughly.
 Make 8 to 12 holes all over the potatoes. This will allow moisture to escape during the cooking process.
 Rub the jackets with olive oil and sprinkle them with salt. You can skip this step if you don't like to eat the jackets.
 This protects the potatoes from overcooking in the slow cooker. (Note: next time you go camping, follow this method and place foil-wrapped potatoes on the embers of your campfire. If you keep the embers hot, you'll have delicious jacket potatoes in two or three hours' time.)

, You can start cooking your potatoes before work and come home to perfectly cooked jacket potatoes.
 Remove the foil and slice the potatoes lengthwise. Use a fork to fluff the potatoes. Top the potatoes with butter, salt, and any other toppings or seasonings you like.
