 This way, if the opponent is opening a flick serve, you can easily return it without turning 180 degrees at full speed.;
, This can allow you to easily run or shuffle back if the shuttlecock goes behind you. If you allow either leg to be completely straight, then it will take longer to get moving also.
 This will help you push off backwards, especially towards the corner.
 Still, try to be able to play effective flick serve returns. If you cope easily with flick serves, then youâ€™re standing too far back! Force yourself to move farther forwards.
