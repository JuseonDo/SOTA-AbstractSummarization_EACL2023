 First we'll start with a basic anime vampire. Start with drawing a basic circle, it does not need to be perfect.;
, This is a pretty simple step, and all that is needed to draw the face. With anime characters the face is usually very pointy. For females the face has a bit more of a delicate curve. Males have a stronger more defined face altogether.
 You don't need it anymore. Now we have to draw a cross along your character's face. These will be your guidelines. Most of a characters facial features will fall into place with these guidelines.
,, There you have it, you now know how to draw a basic anime face.
 With the eyes just add dark rims around the eyes, For the eyes you could colour them bright red to show your character vampire is hungry.
 draw it how you want, drawing your own hair and even trying different eyes, etc.
 Just do what you can and you will improve.
