, Scoop some butter into a small microwave safe bowl. Microwave it for 30 seconds to a minute. Microwave it for longer depending on the type of microwave you have.
 Tap the egg gently against the side of the bowl and crack it open. Using a wooden stick stir the egg.
 Pour the melted butter into the egg. Mix it up.
 Gradually pour in flour to the bowl. Stir while pouring in the flour.
 Pour the sugar in gradually and continue to stir while doing so.
 Use an electric mixer if you're having trouble with lumps.
 Add the baking soda and pour the vinegar directly onto the baking soda to neutralize it. Fizzing should occur when you do this.
,, Butter up the pan to prevent sticking. Place apple slices in small portions so that they donâ€™t scuff up the flour. Place the apple slices on the bottom of the pan.
 Try not to stack a lot of apples on top of each other so it will bake evenly.
 Pour the mixture slowly over the apples and make sure there is an even distribution of dough.
