 Using more gives a more chocolate-y flavor. 6 tablespoons (88.7 ml) makes it really chocolate-y.
 Mix it all together., Depending on your taste, add more or less.

You can taste it while it's cold to see if you like it or not.


Take it out and taste to make sure it is the right temperature. If it's too hot, add a little milk.
Don't let this sit out too long. Even if you use water, it still has creamer in it, which will go bad. Milk and creamer go bad pretty quickly.
