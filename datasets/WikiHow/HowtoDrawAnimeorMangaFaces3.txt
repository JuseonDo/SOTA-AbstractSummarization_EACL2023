@summary
draw a circle, with a line indicating the center of the face's plane, don`t the bottom hemisphere of your circle and coming down to a point at the chin.

@summary

@summary

@summary
draw the hair.

finally, ink your drawing, and color, if desired - traditionally this is done in watercolor and ink, or cg, experimenting with different media.

 You can adjust this line to get different face shapes for different types of characters.
 Again, your eyes will vary depending on the character you're drawing. Girls/young children/heroes/protagonists' eyes tend to be larger while boys/ tomboys/adults/ and antagonists have narrow eyes; but it's really up to you. Eyes are one of the most important features of manga, they say a lot about the person and their mood. Drawing the eyes narrowed shows thoughtfulness/ anger, drawing them bigger and rounder with bigger pupils shows surprise. Eyes that are drawn wide open with small pupils shows fear.
 A straight or curved nose, a small mouth. Boys noses are bigger: when showing happiness they're usually high up and rounded, slanted eyebrows show anger, upwards slanted eyebrows show surprise etc.
 This is the fun part! Anime/manga hair is very unique and you can make it however you want.
