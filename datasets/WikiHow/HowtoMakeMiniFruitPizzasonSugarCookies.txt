 Get out a mixing bowl, a mixer, a large mixing spoon, all the ingredients listed under Sugar Cookies ingredients, a little extra flour, a rolling pin, and a cookie cutter.;
, Mix until it forms a creamy consistency.
 Beat for two minutes.
, Add to the cream mixture. Use a spoon to mix until all the dry ingredients are completely blended.


Mix as little as necessary once the baking powder and soda have been put in. Just do it enough to ensure there are no lumps and then stop.
 Use cookie cutter to cut dough.
 Bake at 350ºF/180ºC for 10-12 minutes.
, Once the combination is smooth and creamy, add in the sugar.


For a smoother more whipped consistency, use a mixer whipping attachment or whisk rather than the blending attachment used for the sugar cookies.
, Place the chopped fruit in the fridge until it is ready to use.


Leave some fruit uncut such as blueberries and cut others such as strawberries or kiwi. Choose fruits of different shapes and sizes to create a more pleasing appearance.
 Cover the cookies with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting, and put fruit on top as desired.


Lightly push the fruit into the cream cheese frosting so that it will stay when the mini fruit pizza cookies are moved.
 Keep the mini fruit pizza cookies covered and refrigerated until ready to serve.
