One of the best cleaners you can use for this job is MEK or methyl ethyl ketone, an industrial solvent. Pour MEK into a disposable aluminum foil pan and soak the parts. If necessary, use air pressure, brushes or rags to reach every surface of the firearm.
 Even a single drop of oil will cause the Duracoat to peel.
, This will also facilitate spraying Duracoat and allowing drying time between coats.


A pegboard will work as a holder for hanging the parts. Cover the pegboard with heavy plastic to protect the surface from over spray.
 In case of a painting mistake, dip the part into the pan to remove the paint. You can also use it to clear the air-sprayer tip if necessary or to clean your hands of excess paint.
, Test spray on a scrap piece of metal to check color.
 Shake thoroughly for at least 3 minutes, and pour into the paint receptacle on the air-sprayer.
 You can go back for another pass or 2 before allowing it to dry. The ideal final thickness of Duracoat should be 1 mil, applied in 1 to 3 passes.


When spraying Duracoat on parts that receive more wear, such as parts that rub against holsters and slings, aim for a coating 1.5 mil for added endurance.
 They will be dry enough for light use in 24 hours, but ideally they should be allowed to dry for 2 weeks.
 Do not dispose of Duracoat and other chemicals in sewer lines. If you will not use up the Duracoat within 18 months, take to a licensed disposal facility.
