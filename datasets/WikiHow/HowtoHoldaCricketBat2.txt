start with the orthodox grip, then rotate your bottom hand so your fingers are fully under the bat when the flat side is facing downward.

use the ‘o’ shaped grip for more power on cross-batted shots.

@summary
know that batters often adopt this technique when using bats that are too heavy for them.if you find yourself having a hard time making solid contact on vertical swings, or often edging the ball behind to the keeper or slips, then you may need to try a lighter bat, which allows you to use a more orthodox grip.
@article
 In the orthodox grip, only the tips of your fingers will rest under the bat handle when the flat side faces downward. With the ‘O’ shaped grip, your entire fingers will rest under the bat.This means you will rotate the ‘V’ formed by the thumb and forefinger of your bottom hand – counterclockwise if your right hand is the bottom one, clockwise if your left – so that the ‘V’ faces the edge of the bat.
If you are holding the flat side of the bat downwards, this means the ‘V’ formed by your bottom hand will now be oriented horizontally to the ground, rather than facing downwards.


This grip feels more natural than the orthodox grip, but because it gives the bottom hand more influence, it leads to swinging across the line (laterally to the ball), which makes it harder to hit vertical shots.,
