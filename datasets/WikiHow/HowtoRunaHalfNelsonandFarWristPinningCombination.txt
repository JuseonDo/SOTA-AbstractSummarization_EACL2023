 Underhook and cup the shoulder. This arm is going to be the near arm (the arm on the side that you are riding on). The other arm, your far arm, will go and grab your opponent's wrist on the far side.;
, With your palm facing the ceiling, thread your arm up to the opponent's neck. Drive your weight towards their head, and begin to move perpendicular.
 This keeps their head down and gives greater control as you take your opponent to their back.
 Keep your weight on your opponent. Work their arm like a lever, using your arm and your momentum to generate the leverage. As you spin out, straighten your arm, and elevate your opponent's arm up to about 75-80 degrees.
 "Sink" the half nelson. You accomplish this by threading your near arm underneath his head. Pull up on the side of his head to elevate the opponent's head up, so that that way you can sink the half-nelson in deeper. Do so. Then, with your fist in their chest, and their head in your elbow joint, crank up on the head, putting pressure down on the chest.
 You don't want to be too high, or when you take your opponent over, they will just roll through or bridge you off.
 Since you've already sunk the pinning combination while they were still on their side, you can now pin them easily by putting them on their backs!
