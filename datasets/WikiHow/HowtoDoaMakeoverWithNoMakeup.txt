 Wash your face with a face wash or soap and warm water. Some soap can be drying on the more delicate skin of your face. Only use ordinary hand soap to wash your face if you have no choice. Use a face cloth or flannel in small circular motions on your forehead and cheeks to help remove the dead skin cells of the day.;
, Toners help to remove every trace of dirt from your skin and close your pores. Not everyone uses one, it's optional. Even though it is called toner, it doesn't have a colour tone and is not make-up., Whether you have dry, oily, or combination skin, there is a lotion for you. Apply this to your cheeks, nose and forehead. Use a product with a sun block in it if you wish. This can help to protect your skin from Sun damage. Look for creams, lotions or moisturizer with an SPF rating.
 If you are not allowed to or do not have any tweezers, just brush your brows into place with a clean toothbrush and wet them to make them darker.

 If you have any body glitter that you can use, spread it on your upper cheeks. Use anything that could simulate makeup, such as tinted moisturizer, which is make up.
 If you are allowed to put on lip gloss, do so. Spread it on thinly and rub your lips together. If you can't, simply use Chapstick or other lip balm to make your lips smooth.
 File them evenly, buff them, and paint them if you have permission. Pair this up with some fragrant lotion to smooth your hands.
 Also, you could spray some body mist or perfume.
