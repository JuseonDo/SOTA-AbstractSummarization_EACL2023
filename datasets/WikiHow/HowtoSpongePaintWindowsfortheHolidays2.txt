 Avoid sponges that have a "scrubber" side and stick with soft dish or paint sponges.
 Trees and stars are fairly simple options, but you can go even simpler by cutting out basic geometric shapes, including circles and triangles, and using the shapes to create more elaborate pictures like ornaments and snowmen.
,, Do not allow the sponge to sit in the paint for a prolonged period, since it may soak up too much and ruin the "sponge" texture of the final product.
 It is important to keep the paint on one side of the sponge to prevent dripping.
 Apply gentle pressure to prevent the sponge from "squeezing out" the paint and causing it to drip down.
 When the sponge no longer leaves a painted image, dip it back into the paint and repeat the same process.
