In general, the international aid worker community, and especially that of the United Nations, is a rather close community, and you will need to make yourself known to that community before applying for positions.



You do not need to volunteer with a United Nations project at first, and the exact nature of your work is not as important as the experience you gain on an aid project. Even working in the office of an international organization will give you valuable exposure to the aid world.



A good heart is not enough to win a position as an aid worker; professional experience and a demonstrated work ethic are essential. Working for a year as a nurse or a teacher will make you a much more attractive candidate for the UN.
 Gain as much language proficiency as you can.
, Ask them about available positions with the United Nations and any friends they may have in the organization.


The hiring process for aid work, including that of the United Nations, relies heavily on connections and recommendations. It is essential that you know someone in the field, if not at the UN, who can vouch for you.
 Look for positions marked FS-1, which require the least amount of experience.
 In your cover letter, emphasize your professional experience and not your ideals.


Have your friends or connections attach a recommendation or make a phone call on your behalf. Veteran Aid workers emphasize those connections and demonstrated ability are much more important than professing a desire to change the world.
