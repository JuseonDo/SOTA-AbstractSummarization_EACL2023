 It is the best method for both straightening and curling a wig.It is also the best method for synthetic wigs that may be more delicate to heated styling tools.
 Allow the hair to fall straight down without resting on anything. Tripods work brilliantly if you fit a mannequin head on them.
 Boil about 1.5L for a long wig and 1L or less for a short wig.
 The heat of the water will soften the plastic fibers and will pull them down.
, Use a wide soft-bristled brush. For extremely curly wigs, it will take more than one treatment and a lot of time.
 It does no damage to the wig and can be done while the wig is still wet. This is a permanent style; you will need to re-curl the wig if you don't want it straight anymore. You're basically remolding plastic into a new shape, so will need to mold it back if you want the curls again.
