@summary
once you are done adding those details, you can add tack or equipment, such as: saddles, bridles, saddle blankets, breast plates, horseshoes, halters with or without lead rope, polo wraps/leg wraps and ear bonnets.

@summary
once done all that, colour your horse!
@article
 Make sure to choose a style of equipment either Western or English or else the horse would look silly all dressed up in dressage equipment(an english competition) with a bulky western saddle. If you like even add a rider.
 Colour the equipment too! If the horse is suppose to look real use black or brown for the leather saddles or bridles since that is the most common colour for them.
