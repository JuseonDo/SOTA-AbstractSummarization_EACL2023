 You will need the following:


Bags of passionfruit tea
A teapot or regular pot
2 cups of water
A pitcher
Ice
1-2 tablespoons of honey
A mug;
,, Here's what you need to do:


Make sure the pitcher is made of thick glass. Thin glass can shatter when hot liquids are poured into it.
Also make sure that the pitcher is already at least room temperature by running room temperature water around the outside of the pitcher from the faucet. This helps keep the pitcher at stable temperature so that when it comes into contact with nearly boiling hot liquid there is not a drastic enough temperature change to make the glass shatter.
,,, Stir it into the tea to dissolve it.
,,, Enjoy this tasty tea on its own or garnished with a sprig of mint.
