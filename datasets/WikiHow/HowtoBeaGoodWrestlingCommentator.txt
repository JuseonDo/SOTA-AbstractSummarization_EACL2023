@article
 Start with enunciating the consonants and vowels, and then singing a few Do-Re-Mi's. If you don't want to it in public, then warm up in your home, hotel, bathroom, etc.;
, Is it singles, TLC, Battle Royal, etc? You will have to probably memorize the whole card.
 You don't have to say everything that you write, because most of the comments are your own originality. Share the script with your partner (if you have one) and see if it makes sense or not.
 Pick an outfit that regular news reporters might wear. The exception is to gimmick wrestlers/color commentators (i.e. Jerry Lawler).
 Be excited about the event and have a lot of charisma
