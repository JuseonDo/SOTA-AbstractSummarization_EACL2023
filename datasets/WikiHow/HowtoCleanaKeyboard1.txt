 Do not remove or connect a keyboard while the computer is running. Doing so may damage the machine if you have a non-USB-based keyboard. Detaching the keyboard while the computer is running is safe when the keyboard is connected to the computer via USB.;
, Be sure to do this in a location where falling debris can be cleaned up easily. Turn the keyboard upside down and tap on it a few times. You should see a bit of dirt fall out. Change the angle and tap harder to make most of it get out.
, Do this by gently prying up each key with a small screwdriver or a similar lever. When the keys have been removed, blow out any debris with compressed air. With a moist (but not wet) cloth, lightly swab all surfaces. Do not allow any type of fluid to enter the keyboard.
