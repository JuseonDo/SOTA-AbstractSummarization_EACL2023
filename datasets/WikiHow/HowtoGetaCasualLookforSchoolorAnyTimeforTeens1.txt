 If a face towel is accessible, use it by rubbing the bar several times into the cloth, then massaging it into your face. Dove bar soap is recommended- especially the white one.;
, Use a scrub and gently massage this into your face, using circular motions. If you have acne, look for one with salicylic acid. St. Ives apricot scrub is highly recommended for this( but any one will work!).
 Use a cleanser that has acne medication and rinse with cool water (to close pores)Many like Noxzema or Neutrogena

, Try Oxy pads!
