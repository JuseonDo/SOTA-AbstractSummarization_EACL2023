 This always comes in handy when you're trying to determine the distance between, say, Wall Street and Times Square, or if you just want to know exactly where you are. However, looking at a map too frequently will make you look like a tourist.;
, If, however, you plan traveling further distances around the city, buy a Metro card - similar to something like a bus pass but more flexible - that will allow you to take the subway or bus transportation for however long you need at a price you pay when you purchase the card.
 This will make organizing your finances much easier and will help you avoid overspending.
 Don't just stand around in the middle of the sidewalk and gawk at all the tall buildings. Keep moving, like the rest of the crowd.
 You can put enough money on the card for all the people in your party or you can buy a weekly pass for yourself. When you're done with the card (if it still has a few rides left on it), give it as a tip to the bellman at your hotel.
