Supplements are not necessary to prevent stretch marks, but you should try to get enough of certain vitamins and minerals that can help protect against stretch marks.,


Foods high in vitamin E include: eggs, fortified cereals, fruit, green leafy vegetables (such as spinach), meat, nuts, nut oils, poultry, olive oil, and whole grains.Wheat germ is high in vitamin E, so you can include more of it in your diet. Anecdotal evidence suggests that wheat germ oil as an ointment can help your skin.Creams containing vitamin E aren't likely to prevent stretch marks as such.However, they may help with itching and skin dryness.The recommended daily allowance of vitamin E is 15 mg per day for both men and women.
Exfoliating creams containing vitamin E can scrub away old skin and promote the growth of new skin.,
