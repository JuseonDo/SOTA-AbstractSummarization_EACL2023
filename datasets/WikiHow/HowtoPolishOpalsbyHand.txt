 The rough/coarse side should be facing up.
 You just need to get it in a size good enough to put on a dop-stick.

Be patient! This bit will take a while.
 Then place your stone into the hot wax (make sure your fingers are wet to prevent the hot wax from sticking and burning you). Turn off your heat source., Put the sandpaper on top of your hand towel to give it cushioning. Rub the stone on sandpaper from 400 grit to 1200 grit., Wet it., This is the final phase/polishing.
