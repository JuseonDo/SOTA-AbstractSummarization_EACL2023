@summary

@summary
lay some brown paper or a paper towel over the remaining wax and iron over the top.

reposition the paper and keep ironing over a fresh part of the piece of paper until most of the wax has been absorbed.

@summary
check the carpet for stains.
@article
 Turn the iron onto its lowest setting and do not use the steam function on the iron, if it exists.
 The back of a butter knife is fine. You can do this while waiting for you iron to heat up.










Keep the iron moving slowly, just as you would when ironing clothes, and make sure you don't burn anything. The heat will cause the wax to melt and absorb into the paper.
, If stains or dyes exist:









Try blotting a little bit of rubbing alcohol onto the area with a white cloth or rag. Take care not to drench the carpet in rubbing alcohol, though.
Keep blotting the stain until it no longer appears on the carpet.
Cover wet area with a clean cloth and cover with books or other heavy objects overnight in order to soak up any remaining rubbing alcohol.
