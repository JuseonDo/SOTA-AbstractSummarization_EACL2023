@summary
1) you need to learn to use two network tools: ping and tracert (traceroute in linux).

@summary
in windows, to use command line, you need to go to start - run (0r cmd).

@summary
you will receive some information of this sort: "64 bytes from maa03s17-in-f7.1e100.net (74.125.236.199): icmp_req=1 ttl=48 time=329 ms"

@summary
,

@summary
now: pay attention, - this is the tool you will use to your advantage.

@summary
,

@summary
2) the second tool needed is "tracert" in windows or "traceroute" in linux.

@summary
this time you will receive a bit more information.

@summary
practice a bit on some innocent addresses, both ping and traceroute.

@summary
,3) the detective work.

@summary
take the address that gives you a certain trouble regarding your downloads.

@summary
now, start your download (or start watching video and such).

@summary
note down the addresses of these offending nodes, for example:"0.ge-1-3-0.xt2.nyc9.alter.net" - the whole thing, this is important.

@summary
,4) the repair stage.

@summary
sometimes you can start doing this while the download is happening.

@summary
open the command line tool, and use the "ping" command.

@summary
now, while doing this - start your download or stream and such.

 While there are some rather simple click and click programs using this tools, the simplest way is to use command line, both in Windows and in Linux. In linux you need to open a terminal (console) window.;
, First try a few sites, for example "ping google.com". You may use www., or not.
,, Again open the command line (Start - run or cmd, or terminal in Linux) and type: "tracert google.com" in Windows or "traceroute google.com" in Linux.
 You will see the addresses of the nodes through which your signal is traveling, and the TIMES it spends at each one of them.
,, First "tracer(ou)t(e)" it on its' own. Let's say "tracert ftp://myftpthingy.net". Note down (or save to a text file) your results. You will be able to see about 10-30 nodes through which your connection travels. The times spent at any one of them will be much less then a second (1 millisecond is 1 thousandth of the second). Normally from about 30ms to may be 200ms. There are some different possible numbers here, do not worry much.
 WHILE DOING THIS - "tracer(ou)t(e)" the address again. If you are experiencing speed or connection problems - you will see some very different numbers of the milliseconds for the same nodes. Some of this numbers will run into few seconds. Some nodes will pretend to be stupid and keep on asking "what's that my dear?", -you will see a few ***.**ms values next to them. Very often after this nodes - the connection breaks.
,, More often then not, you will have to reset the connection, - close the browser, open again.
 As the address use the address of the node that increased request time many fold, or kept on issuing reset requests. For example: "ping P15-3.CLPPVA-LCR-02.verizon-gni.net".
