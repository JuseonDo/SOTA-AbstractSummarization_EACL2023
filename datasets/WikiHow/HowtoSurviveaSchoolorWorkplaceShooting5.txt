 The first people to arrive are there to locate and deal with the shooter, not to rescue people. Do not leave a hiding spot, and do not get in their way.


If you are wounded, wait for a paramedic or firefighter.
 When you are within sight of the police, raise your hands and spread your fingers to show you are not a threat. Keep your hands visible at all times.
 If you have any information on the shooter's location or type of weaponry, let the nearest officer know.
 Don't stop to ask police for directions. If it's safe to move, run in the direction the police came from, keeping your hands raised and visible.
 Do so as fast as possible and without argument.
