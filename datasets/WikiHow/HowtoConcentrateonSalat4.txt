 Keep in mind that your life in general has an effect on prayer (and vice versa).
 Eating non-halal food, earning unlawful income, and committing sins take away the joy and concentration in prayer.
 Let your employers or boss know that you need a few minutes break for prayers and a longer break on Friday noon (for Muslim brothers). Avoid night shift duty, if possible.

Avoid activities that divert your attention (e.g. too much gossip, TV, music etc), as mentioned in Surah Al-Mu’minun.
