 If you don't have one, you'll need to purchase one from a computing supplies retailer.
 Then:


Go to the Bootable preferences and select the CD/DVD ROM (Win XP) to the first preference and Hard drive to the second.
Select Save, then Exit from the BIOS settings.
Restart your computer. In some cases the computer will restart automatically after saving and exiting from the BIOS settings.
 While the message may seem negative, don't worry. Just press any key and wait for your computer to load to another screen.
 Choose the FAT 32 option. In the next step, choose any option you like and there you have it––you've just formatted your hard drive to FAT32.
