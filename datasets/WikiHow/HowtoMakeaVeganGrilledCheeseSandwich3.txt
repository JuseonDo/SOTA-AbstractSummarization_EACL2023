 Remove the stem and seeds, and any veins. The removal of the seeds helps to tone down the chili's heat. Chop finely, then set aside., Spread the vegan cream cheese on one slice of bread. Sprinkle the finely chopped jalapeño over the spread, making sure to cover it evenly., Sprinkle with the pickled jalapeño slices. Lay the other cheese slice over the top of the jalapeño pieces., Spread a little vegan "butter" spread on the outside of both pieces of bread. This step is optional but will increase the buttery crispiness of the whole sandwich once cooked., Add vegetable or coconut oil. When it has heated up, carefully add the sandwich., Press down on the sandwich as it cooks, using a spatula. This helps to keep the sandwich together and causes the vegan cheese to melt and ooze nicely., Cook the other side for about the same time. If the oil has been soaked up, add more to avoid burning., Pop onto a plate, cut in halves and serve immediately.
