 Likely you'll find one under your sink, in the basement, or in the garage. If not, try a local thrift store or a recycling depot. Wash the bottle well, to remove any stains or dust; use a good detergent. You can sand it with fine sandpaper if it is rough anywhere.;
, Choose whichever you have.
 Alternatively, use any other craft adhesive that would be suitable.
 Begin to wrap the twine over the first section of glue, holding in it place to ensure that it sits evenly and is closely aligned.


In place of glue, you can use Mod Podge if preferred.
 Make sure that there are no spaces left between the coils you've added.



Let the adhesive dry completely.

Briefly expose the loose twine to the flame.
 Now your vase is ready; you can put flowers or a candle into the bottle if you like.


If you'd like to protect the twine wrapping for longer, you can seal it with Mod Podge. This is entirely optional.
