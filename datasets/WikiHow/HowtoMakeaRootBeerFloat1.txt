, Drizzle a small amount of root beer on top of the ice cream. This will turn to foam. Keep pouring until your glass is full.
 If this happens, keep the foam to a minimum by pouring the root beer first, stirring and waiting for the bubbles to subside before adding the ice cream. Be sure you tilt the glass to the side and slowly pour in the root beer the same way you'd treat beer anytime you pour it.
, Try to sip all the yummy out!
