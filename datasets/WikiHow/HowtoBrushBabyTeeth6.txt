 Keep the time spent brushing to a minimum so he does not become frustrated or lose interest.
, Count each tooth as he brushes it. Allow him to look in the mirror while he is brushing his teeth.
 Speak to him about what you are doing to get him engaged. Encourage him to follow your lead and do what you do.
 Continue to work on the rinse and spit technique until he masters it. It can take some time before he perfects this step. Watching you do this can be helpful in the learning process.
 Most children love to play in water, so getting him to rinse the brush after brushing should not be too much of a challenge.
 Anything that will make your child feel rewarded will work. Offer a special reward after each brushing, such as reading a favorite book, playing with a favorite toy or engaging in a favorite activity. Be creative and find what will work best for your baby.
