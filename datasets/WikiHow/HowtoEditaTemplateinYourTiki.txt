You will see a very long list of templates. You should have an idea of what you are looking for. For example: if you want to edit your SendMail template, hold down CTRL F (for your find feature) and search for SendMail. If you don't find it, experiment with spacing or check your spelling.
If you decide to customize your template files, you should create your own theme instead of changing an existing theme's template files. This will make future Tiki upgrades easier â€” you don't want to overwrite your customizations each time you upgrade!
