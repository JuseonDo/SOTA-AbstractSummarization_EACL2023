, Make sure you have at least one slot in your Pokémon team and at least one Pokéball.
 It is a very special Pokémon. For this Pokémon has 1 HP, but only "super effective" hits work, so everything else will miss!

, If you level it up far enough, you should get Confuse Ray and Smite as well.
 Make sure to save before battling it!

, Immediately use Double Team 6 times. Rayquaza has the move Fly, which is super effective against Shedinja.
 This will make its accuracy very poor.
 It will use Rest after that, and you can use Smite to lower its PP count of Rests.
 If your Pokémon is fairly strong for a 40, it should lower its health around a fourth.
