 While this does not necessarily mean standing athletically with feet at shoulder-width, as this can be difficult in a tournament or high-pressure scenario, you do want to prevent yourself from falling over, or even exposing yourself any more than you need to.;
, Hold your gun up, with your air tank rested against your shoulder (not ON your shoulder), possibly on your bicep. Tuck your elbows in, so that both your elbows face the ground. While you may have to bend your wrist more than you are used to, this is necessary to avoid exposing your arm. Hold your gun in front of your face so that you are looking down the barrel of your gun, with the gun more or less between your eyes.
 Often your opponent may be posted on you, meaning he is looking out from his bunker, watching yours in wait for you to come out. If you are snapping out from the right side of your bunker, face more to the right so that you will be doing a slight lean forward and can avoid awkwardly leaning to the side (this may vary, depending on the comfort and the experience of the player) also, when switching to the opposite side of your bunker, you should also consider switching your gun to the other hand. If you're going to snap left, then have your left hand out in front, and vice versa.
 Shoot a few balls out at your opponent and snap back into your bunker.
