 Preferably a grassy-land, opposed to a Desert.;
, Its always good to start with the basics. This outer frame will be the beginning of your Brick House! , ~Use brick stairs and brick half slabs to make the roof. ~Vines will make the outside of your Brick house look very decorative.

Use Glowstone so there is nice lighting. ~Use Flower Pots and flowers (Or Tress) to have nice gardening decor out side. ~ Add some windows for it too look more realistic.
 First, go into your new home...Did you walk straight in? If you did, You have forgotten the door! You don't want to go letting Zombies and Spiders going into your home at night now do you?

Add a Wooden Door somewhere in the front of your home (Or an Iron one) so you don't have any surprises when you walk into your home at night.
 You can even place paintings or any other types of decorations.
