 There are 2 separate programs: the Verizon Wireless wholesale distribution channel and a retail channel corporate account. Once you decide which one you want, you can start the process of applying.


The wholesale distribution option requires a 5,000-line minimum while the retail channel account option does not offer as many discounts.;
,, This application will also include a background check on everyone who has at least 5% interest in your company or daily control of your business.
 This fee is required and is non-refundable.
 This should be included with your materials sent to you from your Verizon Wireless account manager.
 Verizon Wireless does not assist Verizon resellers with this process. You must also pay all of the advertising costs.
, Verizon will be able to help you with this step and give you its requirements for sourcing product.
 You will need to have your own email address so that Verizon can communicate with you; many times, rather than a phone call or letter in the mail, an email is the more efficient type of communication between companies and their members.
 You would get these from the IRS so that you can prove that you are certified to sell items requiring sales tax within your state.
 This is important since Verizon Wireless does not provide IT support to your customers or your company.
 If you are joining the wholesale program, ensure that you are capable of achieving at least 5,000 active subscribers within the first 9 months of your contract.
