 There are less people and a lower risk of getting bullied.
 It feels better to block their chat than to see it., Also go to your den and lock it., You are less likely to get bullied if you are with other jammers., Make sure to lock it so only your friends can come in not the bully. Come out for parties and some other fun but after always go back to your den.,, They will disappear and will tell the bully you locked your den!, Troll traders are usually bullies - after they troll you, they sometimes say something mean. Block them so they cannot send you any jam a grams, trade, or even talk to you., If they are at everyone, a jammer could just bully you through there, even if you are in your locked den. Lock your jam a grams and block them so they cannot send you anymore. The same goes for the jammer wall., This will get the bully suspended or even banned. Before you recycle any rude jammer wall posts or jam a grams they sent to you, report them, then recycle them. This way, AJHQ will actually see the rude posts rather than just viewing them and not catching the exact moments when they're rude. Once the bully finds out they're suspended, they will hopefully learn their lesson.
