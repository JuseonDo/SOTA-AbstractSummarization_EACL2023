 This commuter rail will take you from Salt Lake City's outskirts and suburbs into the heart of the city. The locomotive travels up to 79 miles (127Â km) an hour.
 Keep in mind that you can use a round-trip FrontRunner ticket for any TRAX or bus transit as well.


Ride Trax from the University of Utah medical complex to downtown or travel to the Sandy Civic Center and back to Salt Lake City downtown quickly. Scheduled stops vary depending on the route, but most run from 5:00 a.m. past midnight on weekdays and even later on weekends.
