 Eat these plain or decorate them. Here are some decorating tips:


Sprinkles: Use chocolate, rainbow or sugar sprinkles. Add sprinkles before baking the cookies. If you haven't done so already, ice and then add them.
Sandwich: Take two cookies and spread some chocolate or jelly between them.
Icing: Take some cookie icing and spread it all over the cookie.
Toppings: Add on other desired toppings such as nuts, colored sugar or chocolate chips.
 Line the box with wax or parchment paper first and add in carefully. You might like to compartmentalize if adding different spritz shapes. Finish with a pretty bow and perhaps attach the ingredients list so that the recipient can be reassured of the contents.
