 If you’re a team administrator, you can instruct Slackbot to respond to certain words or phrases with specific text. Start by opening the Slack application on your computer and signing in to your team., A small menu will expand.
, Now you’ll see a tabbed website that has various customization options for your Slack team., This is where you’ll come to add and remove custom Slackbot responses.
 Note that every time someone uses this phrase anywhere in Slack, Slackbot will respond with your custom text.For example, if you type the words “wi-fi password” into this box, you can have Slackbot respond with the password.
 When anyone on your team types the trigger word or phrase, Slackbot will respond with whatever you type here. When you’re done, your changes will save automatically.


For example, if you typed “wi-fi password” into the previous box, you can type something like, “If you’re looking for the office Wi-Fi password, here it is: g0t3Am!”

, You can create another response in the same manner now, or you can return later if the need arises. Otherwise, you can close the window.
