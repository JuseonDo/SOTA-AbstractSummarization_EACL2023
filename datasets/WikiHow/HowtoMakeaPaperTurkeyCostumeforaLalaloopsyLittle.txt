 Now, spread out the fingers of your hand and trace it.


If you have one, get out your brother or sister to trace his or her hand. A child's hand must be used for the feathers. You can skip this sub-step if your hand is small.;
, It looks better if you have seven or eight feathers instead of four (The thumb doesn't count)

, The palm will be colored brown. The feathers will colored different things (i.e. Red, green, blue, purple, yellow)

, Cut the thumb off.
 Cut it out.
 Tape those sides to the palm.
 Don't worry, it'll be easy to put the costume on the Little.
 The arms are above the strip.
