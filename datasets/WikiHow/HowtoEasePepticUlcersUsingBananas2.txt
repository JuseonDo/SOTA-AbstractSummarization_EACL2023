 Doing this will help unlock the most effective treatment for peptic ulcers. Dried bananas contain sitoindosidesÂ which helps to increase mucus in the digestive tract, which in turn helps to prevent and heal ulcers. Unripe bananas may promote cell growth in the intestinal tract. Lastly, dried bananas contain polysaccharides, which is also found in anti-ulcer drugs., You can peel the unripe banana either with your hands by gently breaking off the top and peeling down the skin, or by using a knife to cut off the top and then peeling down the skin.
 Dehydrate the bananas by either leaving them on a baking tray in the sun for 7 days, or by placing them in the oven at 170 degrees F for five hours., If you do not have a pestle and mortar, you can try putting the banana in a plastic bag and using a rolling pin or another heavy object to crush the banana., Take this mixture three times per day, in the morning, afternoon and night. You can add milk or another liquid to the mixture if you prefer.
