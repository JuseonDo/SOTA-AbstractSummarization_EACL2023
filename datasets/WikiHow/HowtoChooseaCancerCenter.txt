 From the JCAHO website, you can check if a specific facility has met accreditation standards. The website also allows you to peruse performance evaluations.;
, You can search the NCI's database on its website.


A facility is only approved by the NCI after an extensive review that focuses on the center's research programs. The NCI will designate an institution as a "comprehensive" facility if it conducts cancer research in a broad range of areas. The NCI labels more specialized research programs "clinical."

, As of 2011, there are 1,400 ACS-approved facilities in the United States.


The Commission on Cancer (COC) of the ACS is made up of 30 medical organizations that create criteria for cancer care. Their designation is limited to those facilities that provide the best cancer treatment and diagnosis.
The COC's website includes a hospital locator tool that can help you find facilities near you. The tool also provides information about a center's treatment options, screenings and other programs.
 The board may have statistics on a center's expertise in treating the type of cancer you have. Some states prepare surgery volume reports listed by medical procedure.



Things to look for include lab services, 24-hour physicians, a board to discuss tumor findings in patients, social services, physical therapy and rehabilitation.
Find out how up-to-date a center's diagnostic equipment is. Ask about opportunities to participate in experimental medicine or clinical trials if that is important to you.
Ask about any educational programs and resources that will be helpful to you during and after treatment.
,, If you don't drive, use public transportation.
 Make sure it is clean and well-maintained. If possible, meet with the doctors' and nurses' assistants who will participate in your treatment.
