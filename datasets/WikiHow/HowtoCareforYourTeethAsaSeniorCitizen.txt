, Brushing helps remove food and plaque on both natural teeth and dentures. It also helps prevent development of permanent stains.
 If you are having trouble reaching all areas of your mouth when brushing, look into obtaining a special toothbrush that is able to clean hard-to-reach areas. When brushing dentures, use a brush with soft bristles that is specifically designed for cleaning dentures.
 These are the areas where where your toothbrush canâ€™t reach.
 If you wear full or partial dentures, be sure they fit properly and that you are using the correct amount of denture cream. If you experience discomfort, or if you are using more than one tube of denture cream every three weeks, your dentures may not fit properly and should be evaluated. Visit your dentist to see if they need to be adjusted.
 Tell your dentist about any medical conditions, recent operations, allergies, and medications you may be taking, or changes to your medications. This will avoid the potential for adverse interactions with the medications that your dentist may prescribe.
 Check for red, swollen, bleeding gums when you brush. If you have these symptoms, see a dentist; these maybe signs of gingivitis.
 These are signs of oral cancer that should be quickly examined by your dentist.
