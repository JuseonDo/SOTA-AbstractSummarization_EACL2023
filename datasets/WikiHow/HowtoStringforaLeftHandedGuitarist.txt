@summary
if your guitar is fresh out of a music store, gently remove the strings it originally came with by untying the knots.

@summary
if your guitar didn't come with any strings, purchase a pack of six strings.

@summary
string your guitar.

@summary
to tie the string, slip it through the small opening in the tuning peg that the string is for, and wind it around the bar the hole is attached to.

@summary
do the same at the bottom of the guitar, but pull this one a little tighter.

@summary
repeat for all the strings, then break out the tuner to tune the new strings to the desired pitch.

 These strings are usually just arranged for display, though some strings are already adjusted for immediate use. Be sure to have some way to identify which note is which, such as note cards with each note on them. (You can save these for future use in stringing) Otherwise you'll have to undo all of your hard work to fix it!;
, There are two kinds of "E" strings, a lower pitched string and a higher pitched. The first string is the lower pitched of the two. "A", "D", "G", "B" and the higher "E" complete the strings. Make sure when you buy strings they have all of these, even if you have no use for them at the moment. You never know when they'll come in handy.
 The notes that the strings play are organized in a low to high note system. For a left-hand friendly guitar, you simply make the first note the highest, and steadily lower it to the last string in the set. Since a left-handed person requires the guitar to be positioned differently, (the left hand will strum, the right will pick out chords) the strings will play exactly as they do for standard guitarists, merely far more suited for the left-handed.
 Tuck the end under the loop and secure it with a gentle pull. Too tight and you'll damage the peg.
 It is the one most likely to come loose.
