 It could be any breed you know of, look up or even make up! Your imaginary cat could be a Rag Doll, a Siamese, a British Short haired Silver Tabby or even a cat sized Tiger.;
, You can choose any name at all, for example Cookie, Sugar, Lily, Felix, Thomas or Princess. Your imaginary cat might even have two names, his regular name that you call him and his special cat name that he only uses to talk to other imaginary cats.
 These can be real and ordinary, your imaginary cat can like hunting mice eating cooked chicken and a cosy basket, or, you can pretend he like marshmallows, watching TV and sleeping on top of your head!

, You can make or draw toys for you imaginary cat if you like. Think about what you see around you that he'd like to play with, feathers, string, marbles, even scrunched up paper.
 You could make it a home in your room or it can snuggle with you in your bed.
 You can tell him anything, out loud or in your imagination.
 Think where he'd like to perch so he can see everything where ever you are. Remember he'd probably want to be well away from the water when you are having a bath, but some imaginary cat's like to swim!
