 Preferably on a pole or the side of a tree. Make sure it is getting plenty of sunlight-bats like it warm! You can build your own bat box or purchase one.;
,, A bat's predator can be an owl, hawk, or even a bigger bird.
 Place a bird bath in your garden near the bat box or in clear sight of it.
 It may take some time for bats to find your new bat box. If after a few years it goes unused, try moving it to a location with more sun exposure.
