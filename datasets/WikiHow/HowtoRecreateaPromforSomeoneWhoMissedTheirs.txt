@summary
if possible, try to contact your guest of honor's high school and find out things like the school colors, the theme of the prom for the year (s)he would have gone, and maybe see if you can borrow one of the leftover tickets (some schools keep these on file or as keepsakes) to make reproductions of.

,

@summary

 Your ideal venue is any facility with some kind of dance floor, such as a ballroom at a hotel or even a community center, and/or a high school or college auditorium or gymnasium. As long as you have some kind of reasonable dance floor, any venue will do if it feels realistic enough. Check around in the area where you are planning to hold the event.;
, Depending on your budget, this might be a viable way to save yourself a lot of headache, but beware event planner fees can get pretty high too.
, His/her date or significant other should be crowned as the other royalty member.
 This will not be nearly as difficult or expensive as you might think. Obtain photos of your guest of honor and his/her friends from high school in advance, scan them, incorporate them into a 20-page-or-so Microsoft Word document which also includes mock yearbook text, convert it to a PDF file, and submit it to a site such as .
 Either play (or have your DJ play) songs from the era, and/or incorporate the popular trends of the time into the theme. For instance you might have something that resembles a Friends or Titanic theme if your guest of honor graduated in 1998, or an Austin Powers retro-1960s theme if your guest of honor graduated in 2001, etc.
 to come., and try to get at least 20 people to come. You can invite more people if your budget will allow, but try to have at least 20 so it seems at least quasi-realistic. Make sure they all know to dress formally, as this is a "prom" theme.
, If (s)he does not currently have a spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend, consider having someone serve as an escort for him/her. At a last resort, consider hiring a male or female escort (NOT an erotic one) for one night, but beware this can get expensive.
