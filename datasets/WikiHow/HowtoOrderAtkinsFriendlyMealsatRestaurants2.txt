 Low-carb foundation vegetables contain fiber, which fills you up and keeps you from overindulging on other dishes.
 When you bring your own hot sauce or salad dressing from home, you know exactly how many carbs you are eating instead of having to guess.
 Choose grilled or roasted meats instead.
 Gravy is usually thickened with flour, which makes it high in carbohydrates.
 Don’t hesitate to speak up to get the substitutions that you need.
