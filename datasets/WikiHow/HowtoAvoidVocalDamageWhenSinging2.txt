, Instead, drink plenty of water to thin mucus, which is a natural lubricant for vocal folds.Use an expectorant when needed to cough efficiently and gently after a cold. You needn't clear all mucus off the vocal folds in order to sing.

If you are timid, raising the pitch of your speaking voice a little will help you sound more confident., If one of them makes you hoarse, find something better. For some people, taking 4 alfalfa tablets 3x per day is one acceptable alternative to other medications.
