@article
 Find a colander with small holes or one designed for use with rice and grains.


The amount of millet you will need may vary depending on the recipe you choose to follow.
 Keep rinsing as needed until the water appears clear rather than cloudy.
 Stir consistently for approximately 4 minutes.


Toasting the millet enhances its flavor and produces a nutty aroma. Stir the grains in the pan often to keep them from burning.
