 Replace your right-hand needle with a similarly-sized crochet hook. This method is very similar to the standard cast-off, but many people find working with a crochet hook faster and easier. Additionally, this method requires no additional yarn other than a short tail, in case you misjudged length or are otherwise in a bind. , Slide the hook underneath the first two loops on the needle. Remove them from the needle onto your crochet hook. Slide the hoops down so that they rest on the straight part of the tool rather than the hook itself.
 With either your fingers or knitting tools, carefully take the second loop and bring it up over the first. Remove the second stitch from the crochet hook while leaving the first.
 You should now have two loops on the hook. Repeat the previous step with these two stitches. Continue this process with each loop that remains on your needle. Pull the small tail of yarn through the last stitch to finish.
