 Software installation will vary based on its version and brand, so follow the instructions on your screen to install correctly.

 This will reset your Command Prompt execution to your current directory, where the .dll file is located.
 This command finds and unregister  your targeted .dll file. Exclude the quotation marks and the apostrophes; for "(filename)dotdll", insert the name of your target .dll file and the .dll extension., Your .dll file should now be ready for deletion!

,, This will send your .dll file to the Recycling Bin, from which you can delete it permanently.
