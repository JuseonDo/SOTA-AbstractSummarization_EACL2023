 Every ISP has phishing safeguards in place, but you can download and install additional phishing filters. According to PC Magazine,; Opera is the best browser for detecting phishing scams, but all browsers have some safeguards in place.
 Go to a trusted technology website, such as CNET,and read the reviews of phishing software companies; many downloads are free.
 Some browsers allow you to manually check any web page for authenticity by using a phishing filter option.
 Among the most commonly downloaded by Internet users are:


Avast!
McAfee
Microsoft Security Essentials
Trend Micro

, Too many security software programs running at the same time can cause your system to be sluggish. You only need one good anti-phishing program.
