,,, Hoover, clean the kitchen, make up any beds, get everything ready for your guests arriving. (obviously wait until your parents are out as this will look quite suspicious.. unless of course you have permission!)

, You and your friend must go to the local supermarket and stock up on food and drink, you won't want your parents returning to find all the food is gone.
,, Blow up any airbeds, anything that needs cooked for a long time should go in the oven now etc.
, (if you do not have permission for this sleepover then tell them that you are at your friends house, having a sleepover, assure them that you are safe and well (this will keep them off your case during the night).
 Its not ideal if one person is stuck in the kitchen all the time, if there's not too many of you then you could all cook your own. On the other hand its not ideal if there's lots of you crowding the kitchen trying to cook.
 It will make everyone happier and lighten the mood!

, Your parents won't find out if you follow these steps. Do not run around after your friends all night shouting at them to not make a mess, they are at a sleepover, they can't help it plus they are the guests. Put all the dishes beside the sink and the rubbish in the bin to clear up in the morning.
,, Get dressed, brush your teeth, wash your face and put your makeup on.
 Everyone pull together and tidy the house! Your parents will flip if it's a bombsite when they get back. Give everyone a job: someone to hoover, someone on dishes, someone on rubbish etc. Put some upbeat music on to motivate everyone with their chores.
