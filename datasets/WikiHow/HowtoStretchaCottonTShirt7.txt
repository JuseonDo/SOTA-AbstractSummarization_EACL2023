get the entire t-shirt wet.

pull the wrung but wet shirt over the back of a dining chair.

 Either use the washing machine or dunk it into a tub of water.
 Or, choose another appropriately-sized chair that won't be damaged by the water.
 As it dries, the shape of the chair will stretch the t-shirt nicely for you.
