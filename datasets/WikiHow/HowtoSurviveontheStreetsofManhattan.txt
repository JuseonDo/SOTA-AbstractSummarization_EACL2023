 Be sure you mark each destination before you begin your journey. Since Manhattan has many streets, they can be pretty hard to pick out on a map.;
, Depending on how far your destination is away from your current location, it may seem that traveling via taxi is the best option. However, you must take note of the cost of the taxi and the NYC traffic. It may be better to travel by foot after all. Public transportation is also a good way of getting around

, This is the preferred method of transportation in the Big Apple, and millions of pedestrians tend to agree.
 All native New Yorkers do it, but that's because they live there and know how to do it without getting hit by oncoming vehicles. Wait until it says "WALK" rather than walk against the "DON'T WALK" signal.
 You'll want to do this as much as possible to be sure you're on track toward your destination.
 If you're at the intersection of 49th and Broadway facing down Broadway, turn your map so you are looking down Broadway on your map. This will help you avoid any mishaps.
 Cars have places to go, and they won't wait for a confused tourist.
 They will bump you back. It will not be pleasant.
, A little wave will suffice, but don't go crazy. Then nobody will want to stop for you.
Have your money ready for when you arrive at your destination. The cab drivers don't have the time to wait for you to sift through your wallet.
