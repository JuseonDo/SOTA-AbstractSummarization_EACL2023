 When you are playing, on the top right there are some symbols. Click on Garage.

This is done by clicking on 'Supplies'.
, Do not place them randomly because your wasting and also you may be placing them where nobody ever goes.(Do not waste them.),, (if playing 'Capture the Flag' mode)., The enemies may try to take advantage of these places and swarm you with more enemy players., This is called an escort. (assuming you are playing in CTF)., This is like a long range artillery, when the rest go to fight close-up and the "artillery" picks off or weakens the opponents, noticeably giving you advantage.
