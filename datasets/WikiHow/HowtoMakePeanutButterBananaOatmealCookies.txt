 In order to properly cut a 1/4 cup of butter, use the measurements on the wrapper of a block of butter. If there are no measurements on the wrapper, scoop 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of butter. If using sticks of butter, use 1/2 a stick of butter. Put the butter in a glass measuring cup.
 Set the microwave for 15 seconds. When the microwave notifies you that the butter is finished microwaving, carefully take the cup of butter out of the microwave with oven mitts., Mix all of the ingredients with a fork.
