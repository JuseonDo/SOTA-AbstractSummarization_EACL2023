 Less mess, plus collect any dropped materials, so less wastage too.
 Take care not to damage stone if removing hard cement pointing., Insufficient wetting down can cause problems during carbonation., Work from the bottom to the top. Joints should not be filled too proud of the stone. Any large voids can be filled using small stones pushed into the mortar., Remember to dampen down regularly., Once the mortar has stiffened (usually next day), compact into joints using a stiff bristled brush.,, The curing time varies depending on environment, weather conditions and type of mortar used.
