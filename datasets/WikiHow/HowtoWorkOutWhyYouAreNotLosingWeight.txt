 If you are not drinking enough water to keep your body in a constant state of hydration, you will find it hard to lose weight.;
, Cutting calories, skipping meals or flat out starving yourself will not work long-term for effective weight loss.
 Too much bread prevents weight loss.
 If you don't, you will have a hard time losing weight.
, If some part you believes you were meant to be fat, you will be struggling psychologically.
 Avoiding this makes losing weight much less likely.
 If you lack consistency you will keep making self-sabotaging decisions like poor food choices.
 Eating a continuous supply of refined sugar (the stuff found in most packaged and processed items) will sabotage any weight loss efforts.
 These do not work.
 For example, if step # 1 and # 9 are your culprits, then for the next seven days, drink more water and cut the refined sugar out of your diet.
