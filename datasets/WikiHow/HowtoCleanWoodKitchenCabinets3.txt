 A polished cabinet exterior will give your kitchen a warm and lustrous look by bringing out the true character of the wood. Most polishes will leave either a high shine or a low luster, so choose the one that suits your preferences and the look of your kitchen., Applying polish over grease and dust will result in a mess, so be sure clean your cabinets before polishing. Remove all grease and caked-on food, then run a clean cloth over the cabinets to collect residue and dust before proceeding.
 Use a soft towel or microfiber cloth to avoid scratching the wood.
 Work in four or five-inch sections in order to make sure the entire surface of the cabinets get evenly polished. Rub the polish in a gentle circular motion., This removes the excess polish, leaving the spot gleaming and shiny.
 Move on to the next small area until you finish polishing and buffing the entire exterior of your cabinets.
