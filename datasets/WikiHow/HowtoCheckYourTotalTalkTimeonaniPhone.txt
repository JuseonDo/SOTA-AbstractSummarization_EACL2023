 Do this by tapping the gray gear icon on one of your home screens. You may find it in the Utilities folder.;
, The button may be called Mobile Data on your device., This is where you’ll see your talk time for the current period and since you started using the phone.Current Period: This is the time you spent on the phone since you last reset the call statistics. If you’ve never reset them, this number will be cumulative.
Lifetime: This is a running total of all talk time. This count will not be affected by resetting your call statistics.
 Once tapped, the number next to “Current Period” will reset to 0.


It’s a good idea to do this at the start of each billing cycle so the “Current Period” count is always correct. Set a reminder so that you never forget.
