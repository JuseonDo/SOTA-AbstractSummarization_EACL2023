 Since Rockstar has restricted the selling of vehicles, you'll have to find one that meets the following requirements:

The car has to cost under $50.000, if stolen from street/driving NPCs.
If you want to sell a bought vehicle, it has to come from legendarymotorsport.net, southernsanandreassuperautos.com, or warstock-cache-and-carry.com, as long as the vehicle can be stored in a garage.
You cannot sell vehicles obtained from Warstock Cache and Carry if they require Pegasus for delivery, or ones obtained through glitches or exploits.;
,,,

If your vehicle is damaged, there are no options shown to modify it.
