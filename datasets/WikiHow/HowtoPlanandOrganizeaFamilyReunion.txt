 Get the word out - let others know you're planning a family reunion event. Give family members plenty of notice. Usually three or four months advance notice will allow attendees to plan vacation time or make adjustments in scheduling.;

 Create a time line reminder. Make good use of Family Reunion Planner organizers that feature schedulers and time line reminders. Make use of Event Planning Software with editable worksheets and templates.
 Keep the lines of communication wide open.

Share stories and anecdotes. Don't gossip or spread rumors; keep everything positive and friendly.
Bring lots, and lots of love. Even for people you usually clash with!
