 Fly strips are intensely sticky strips that catch and trap flies in your home. Place these strips near your trash can and around areas that the flies in your home tend to congregate, such as sinks., If you already have screens installed, make sure that there are no tears or holes in the screens that flies might be using as highways to your home., Doing so will eliminate any bacteria that may be acting as a breeding site for flies. You should clean the drains with bleach every two weeks.You can use a half cup of bleach and a gallon of water.You could also use a mixture of one cup baking soda and one cup vinegar. Pour the baking soda and vinegar down the drain and then run the water for a minute to clean the drain., Wrap meat products in newspaper or put them in a plastic bag. Put the bag in the freezer until it is garbage collection day. Then, throw them out with the rest of the garbage., This helps prevent leftover scraps from rotting in the recycling container and attracting flies., Leaving the food outside will attract flies that will hang around the site of your pet's food and potentially find their way into your home. By bringing the food indoors, you can reduce the possibility of flies laying maggot eggs on or near your pet's food.
