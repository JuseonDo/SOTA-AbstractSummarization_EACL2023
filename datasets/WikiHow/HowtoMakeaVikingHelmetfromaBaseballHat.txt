  Find a baseball cap at the thrift store, one that fits your head well and is deep enough to sit securely.   At the dollar store, find a ring of styrofoam where the supplies for flower arranging are located.  At the hardware or discount store, get a roll of ordinary, grey duct tape.;
,,  Make them mirror images of one another, since they will go on each side of the hat.
  Try different heights and angles for the horns.
 Cut a 12" piece of #10 common, household wire and double it. Hold the two raw ends and push the wire through from the middle of the horn, and having it come out at the base. Repeat with the second horn. On all four raw wire ends, circle and flatten them and enclose each in duct tape.
 Tape over the flattened wires encased in duct tape on either side of each horn. Criss-cross tape and flatten and mold with your fingers to make it lie flat. Use 6" Pieces of tape and spiral it around the horns, pressing and molding with your hands.
 Angle and criss-cross the pieces to stabilize the horns and incorporate them onto the hat, contouring, overlapping and molding the tape to the hat and around the base of the horns.  Use a lot of pressure to flatten and contour the tape to the hat.
, Lay the ball in place and cover it with another 1" piece of tape. Mimic metallic straps by using contrasting colored duct tape crossed over the front of the like a metallic band.  

,  The possibilities are endless.
