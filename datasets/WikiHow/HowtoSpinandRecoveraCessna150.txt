H – Height: make sure you are at least 4,000 feet (1,219.2 m)+ AGL (Above Ground Level). A higher altitude is safer.






A – Area: check that you are over a relatively empty area of ground.






S – Security: verify your that your seat belt and doors are secured.






E – Engine: make sure your fuel valve is set to ON, your mixture knob is set to rich (all the way in), the carb heat is pulled HOT, oil and temperature gauges are within the green limits, and that your magnetos are set to both with the master switch (red switch on left) is set to on. This can be accomplished using a “7-Up Check” which will be described in the notes.






L – Lookout: perform a gentle turn (no more than 15 degrees of bank) to the left and then the right, forming an S. This is to verify for traffic below you and around you.

, Reduce the throttle and gradually pull back on the control column. This will bring the nose of the aircraft up. Maintain this until you stall the aircraft.
