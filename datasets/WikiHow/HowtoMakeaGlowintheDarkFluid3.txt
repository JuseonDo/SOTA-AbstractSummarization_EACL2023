@article
 Vitamin A, thiamine (vitamin B), niacin, and riboflavin all fluoresce strongly, giving off a bright yellow glow.Most people choose a B Vitamin complex that contains a lot of thiamine and different B Vitamins. (Look for something called Vitamin B 50 complex or something similar).,


The bag will keep the powder contained so you don't lose any. Be aware that the pounding may cause tiny tears in the bag.
 Stir the powder until it is mostly dissolved in the water. While this is a safe solution, you definitely don't want to drink any of this water.
 The fluorescent molecules in the vitamin won't glow in the dark, but they will glow in the presence of a blacklight.


Use extreme caution when using a blacklight around water. Keep the light a safe distance from the water so there is no possibility that it might fall in.
