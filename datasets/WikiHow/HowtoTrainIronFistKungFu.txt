@summary
the training is finally complete once you can perform the closed hand strikes on the bag with full force without injury and with minimum pain to yourself.

@article
 Such a bag should be made from strong material, such as denim, and should be sewn together with strong thread. When filled to maximum capacity with dried mung beans, it should resemble a square cushion.;
, If this is a wall, ensure it is firmly fastened to it.
 You can train the following:

Punching. Clench the fist properly, with the thumb outside, and strike with the first two knuckles. Ensure the wrist is kept straight and using as much force as you can stand, shout with every strike. Variants of punches can be used, such as the Leopard Punch or Phoenix Eye, but be careful with these because if improperly done, can lead to damage or injury.






Hammer-fist. Using the clenched fist, strike with the edge. Using as much force as you can stand, shout with every strike.






Back-fist. With the back of the fist, contact the bag with the first two knuckles. Again, use the most force that you can stand, and shout with every strike.
