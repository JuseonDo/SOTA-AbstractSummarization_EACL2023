 A leaf tip is a tip that goes in an upside-down "V." Wilton's leaf tips are numbers 65s, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73, 74, 113, 352, 349/352s, and 366. Tip 352 is a great starter tip, but any of these will do. You can also purchase one from another brand!;
, If you want to be able to change tips, put a coupler in there first and screw the tip onto the coupler!, You will need to make your own medium-consistency icing, or buy some from Wilton. They sell Wilton icing at craft stores. You can color the icing green if you would like with some icing dye. You should fill the bag about halfway., You don't want an icing spurt while you are decorating!, The wide opening of the "V" should be facing away from you. You should be holding the bag at a 45 degree angle., Move the icing bag in a straight line towards you. Start to relax the pressure on the bag as you move towards the end, creating the tip of your leaf., After you have stopped squeezing, pull the icing bag away.
 The icing may need to be slightly stiffer, but medium consistency icing should work too. If the icing is not stiff enough, chill it for about 10 minutes in your refrigerator and continue decorating.,,, Relax your pressure as you move toward the top of your leaf., Vertical leaves can be used to separate flowers on cakes, as well as create volume.
 The size of your tip will determine the size of your vines.,,
