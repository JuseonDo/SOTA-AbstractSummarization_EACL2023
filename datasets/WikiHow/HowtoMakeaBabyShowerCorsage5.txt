, If her shirt has no lapel, then place the corsage between her shoulder seam and her collar., This will ensure that you don’t stick the pin into the mother-to-be’s skin.



The pin should be angled 45° to the right of the top of the corsage.
If you’re visualizing a clock face, then place the pin at about 1:30.
The pin should go into the fabric and then out of the fabric, catching a small piece of fabric as you push it through.
 Be sure the pin goes through the entire corsage.
 Again, let the pin go in and out of the fabric so that the sharp end of the pin is on top of the fabric.
 This should ensure the stem of the corsage to be secured to the wearer’s lapel or shirt.
