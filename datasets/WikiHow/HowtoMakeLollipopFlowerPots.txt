 Cut the florist's foam to size and stick into the pot.


If you don't want to use florist's foam, use something like a bunch of green cellophane strips stuffed in tightly so that there is enough strength to hold in the lollipops.;
, Wrap this around each individual lollipop. Flare the tissue paper out to look like leaves. Leave the base of the lollipop stick free for sticking into the pot.
 Continue adding the posy wrapped lollipops until the florist's foam can no longer been seen and enough lollipops are spread across the whole pot, looking like a pretty bunch of flowers.
 Place on display or give as a gift.
