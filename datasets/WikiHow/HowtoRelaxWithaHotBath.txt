, Get all your chores and homework done before you relax. Give your mind, body, and spirit some attention and for a while let your worries drift away.
 Take the phone off the hook. Pour yourself a glass of wine, choose a magazine, turn off the bathroom lights and light a candle (scented ones are nice), and run a hot bath adding oil or bubbles or using bath bombs. The aroma therapeutic choices on offer today are staggering. There are plenty of lovely bath products out there and it wouldn't be a bad idea to invest in some!

,, Let your worries dissolve into the water. Think happy thoughts of sun kissed beaches and starlit skies and let thoughts of kids, work and money evaporate with the steam. Open your mind, meditate and just enjoy!

,,, Get creative and make your own homemade face mask by adding 1 Banana (mashed), 1 tablespoon of honey and 5 tablespoons of oats. You can also get many store bought face masks that are reasonably priced too.
