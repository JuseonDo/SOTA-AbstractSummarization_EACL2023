 If you do a lot of work and then just say, "Can I have/go to _______?" then they will feel used because you did work just for you. Show them first that you want it for you, and do something in return.;
, Try doing something you never do, such as wash the dishes, clean the pets cage or litter tray, or take your dog for a walk, do laundry, fold clothes, mop, wash windows, clean toilets, disinfect counters, etc.
 This will show them that you can balance school with home.
 Instead, say strong and powerful words such as inaccurate instead of wrong, etc.
 Stay away from the bad crowd at school. Don't watch that television show your parents hate, find trashy, or don't approve of. This will show that you do care about their opinion and that you aren't just going your own way.
 Little things like this show them that you really are responsible.
, If your parents come home from work, exhausted, don't pester them to make dinner for you. Make it for them! (there's a time and place for everything...if they just woke up, don't start rambling about the new plans your friends made).
 If your curfew is at 11, be home by 10:30. If your school starts at 8, wake up at 6:30 instead of at 7:30. You won't have to beg your parents for a ride. Let them know of all events in advance.
 This will show your parents you will be willing to take care of the something you want.
, Give them examples, but only a few (important ones, of course) so you don't sound like a braggart.
