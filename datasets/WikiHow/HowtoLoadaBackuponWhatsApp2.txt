 If you already have WhatsApp downloaded, you'll need to remove it by tapping and dragging the app to the top of the screen and dropping it in the "Uninstall" folder.
 It's the green app with a white phone icon on it.
 It's at the bottom of the screen.


You may first have to tap OK here to allow WhatsApp access to your camera.
 You'll enter this in the text field in the middle of the page.
 This button is at the bottom of the screen.
 Doing so will prompt WhatsApp to send a text message with a verification code.
, It will say "Your WhatsApp code is but you can simply tap on this link to verify your device" followed by a link.
 If you correctly enter the code, you'll be taken to the backup page.


You can also tap the link to continue to the backup page.
 It's the green button at the bottom of the page. When your backup is complete, you'll tap Next to continue setting up your WhatsApp account.
