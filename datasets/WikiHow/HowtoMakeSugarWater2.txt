 If you need to make a smaller or larger amount, then use one part water and two parts sugar.
 Be sure to stir the water often to help the sugar dissolve.
 Once the water begins to boil, quickly lower the heat and bring it to a simmer; this prevents the sugar from scorching and becoming caramelized.
 Set the pot down on a heat-resistant surface and leave it uncovered until the mixture reaches room temperature.
 Place a funnel over the bottle or jar opening, and slowly pour the liquid inside. Replace the cap or lid and tighten it.
 It will stay fresh for a few weeks to about a month.
