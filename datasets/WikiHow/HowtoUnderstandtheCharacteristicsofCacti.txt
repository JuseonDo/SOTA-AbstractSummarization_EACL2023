 The fruit of the cacti are made up of a flavored mass of pulp. Seeds are sprinkled throughout this mass. The one-celled berry may be dry or juicy, smooth, scaly, or spiny. Often the one-celled fruit is large and brightly colored.;
, On germination of a cactus plant, the cotyledons are the first to break through the surface of the ground. They remain attached for as long as it takes to provide nourishment to the seedling. It is the young plants with these seed leaves that provide the best information on determining the type of plant.
 On the fleshy, generally leafless stem there are latent points for growth. These usually bear cushions of wool or occasionally bristly hairs known as glochids. The spines, leaves (when present), roots, new joints, and flowers grow from the areolas.
 The flower's ovary, which will later become the fruit, must be below the point at which the petals are inserted. The flowers are usually showy and take the shape of a funnel, more or less. They also tend to have many petals.
, More than one season is required for a perennial plant to reach maturity. Perennials do not die after flowering but continue for many seasons.
 Go to the local botanical gardens, backyard or hiking area and see if you can spot the features of cacti in local plants or in the botanical gardens' cacti section.
