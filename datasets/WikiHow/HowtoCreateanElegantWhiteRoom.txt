 This will help you to know what is needed and the direction you want the room to take.;
, Having accents in your room will create the needed contrast and focal points. Black is a nice, stark contrast, which would make an even more elegant room, but you can use any colour you like the most.
 If you have a dark room, you will need to layer many coats. Use long, even strokes in all one direction, and don't touch the paint while it's drying.
 An antique or canopy bed in white would suit the theme nicely.


Get suitable bedspreads as well. You could use white or your chosen accent colour.
 Again, an antique wood side table in white would suit the theme quite nicely.
 All furniture should be white or whitish, preferably antiques. You can paint wood white if needed.
 This should be white.
 You can put your books, DVDs, and CDs on them.
 This does not have to be antique, but crystal or "fristal" (fake crystal) would work very well.
 Choose a deep pile one that you can sink your feet into it when you get up in the morning. Try a rug in your accent colour.
 Have it in white. Place it beside your bed.
 They should be simple black velvet curtains held up by an accent colour ribbon.
 You could add a wall mirror, a wastebasket, etc.
 Put them in black or silver frames.
 Again, hang these in black and silver frames.
 Your couch should be white leather, or pleather if you're vegan or can't afford leather.
 Put magazines and your favorite books on it. You could also have a computer on there if you own one, or a TV.
