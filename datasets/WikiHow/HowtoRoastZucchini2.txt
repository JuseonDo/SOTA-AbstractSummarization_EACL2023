, Rinse away any dirt and debris that may be left on the skin, using a scrubber if necessary to make sure it is entirely clean.
 Place a zucchini on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it lengthwise. Repeat with the remaining zucchinis.
 Arrange them all flesh-side up.
 Make sure each one gets an even coat.
 Put a light sprinkling of each on all the zucchini halves.
 Put an even amount on top of each of the zucchini halves. If you need more Parmesan, feel free to add it - it won't affect the outcome of the dish.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the zucchini for 10 minutes, or until the Parmesan has turned bubbly and golden brown. Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
 Place the ribboned basil on top of the zucchini halves to serve. This is great as either a side dish or a light main course.
