 If the mark is too large, or none of these methods seems to get rid of the Sharpie mark, you may have no other option than to paint over the mark.
 Alternatively, purchase a test pot in the exact color if you do not have the original paint. Use paint charts if you don’t know the name of the color.
 Wipe clean, scrub if needed, and allow to dry.
 Paint several times to ensure it is covered. Smooth the paintwork into the existing wall color to prevent it from standing out too much as a “patch.”
