 (Add less rather than more because you can always adjust it later) You can use distilled water which is said to have a better affect but either way should work fine.
 Basically any tea that turns a maroon or red when added. Hibiscus is a very good option because it turns red when added to water and its very healthy for hair. You want to add nearly a third as much tea powder or mix as you have water. You're trying to make it as concentrated as possible., You can also use cinnamon powder, but using the sticks makes the dye stronger and fresher. So just add some extra cinnamon powder if that is what you will be using. Cinnamon makes the hair lighter.

Remember, the stronger that you make the tea the more effective it will be.
You may also add chamomile to the mixture.
, You may also use pure organic honey, but its a little less affective., You will most likely have to add a little bit of water. But, add no more than half a cup., Take it off the stove if you see that the tea mix is sticking to the sides or the water is running out., Then select the container that you want to store the mixture in. Glass or steel is preferable because the solution may be still very hot., Then throw away the tea pulp and your dye is ready!

If you don't have a strainer, it may also work with coffee filter paper but it might be messy to make sure that you do it in the sink. This solution will stain heavily.
For added effect, add a spoon of lemon juice. But this will try out hair so don't do it if you have dry hair. The solution will work perfectly fine without lemon juice.
 But, bring to room temperature before applying.
