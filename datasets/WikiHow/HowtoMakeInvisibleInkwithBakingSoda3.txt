 The best grape juice to use for revealing your invisible ink is the concentrated kind, which often comes frozen.Concentrated juice contains more acid and will create a stronger reaction with the baking soda in the invisible ink.


You can use any dark, acidic liquid such as cherry or blackcurrant juice or balsamic vinegar to reveal your message.,


Be careful painting with grape juice; it stains.
Don’t use the same cotton swab or paintbrush you used to write the message.
 As you paint over the surface of the paper, your letters will reappear before your eyes. The letters appear gray because a chemical reaction occurs between the basic baking soda and acidic grape juice.
