, Wash and clean the potatoes.
 Cut a little part off one of the long sides of the potato. Just cut enough to prevent the potato from rolling when it is set down.
 Do not slice the whole way down though, as the slices are to remain attached to the potato, from the base. Repeat for each potato being made.


Cut about 20 slices/cuts, depending on the size of each potato.
The sliced cuts will fan out when each potato is baked.
 Mix the olive oil, melted butter and salt into a mixing bowl.
 Brush lightly.
, Bake for half an hour.
 Spread a little more of the basting mix over the top of the potatoes. You can even add a pinch more salt (optional).
 Enjoy the fanned out potatoes.
