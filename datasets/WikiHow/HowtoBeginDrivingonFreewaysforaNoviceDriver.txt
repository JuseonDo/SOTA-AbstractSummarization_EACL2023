@summary
pick a highway and a time.

@summary
learn to operate the car at lower speeds first.

@summary
make sure your car's brakes, lights, turn signals, steering, transmission and all other parts are working safely.

@summary
start on a day when the weather is clear and dry.

@summary
start driving from your driveway, then head for the freeway on-ramp.

@summary
as you come up the on-ramp, use your turn signal, check your blind spot and mirrors, look forward again and merge onto the highway.

@summary
practice changing lanes as you cruise down the highway.

@summary
once you're comfortable changing lanes, try passing other cars.

@summary
when you're ready to get off the highway, find an appropriate off-ramp and get in the correct lane, using the steps to change lanes.

@summary
once you're off the highway, you can go home, or look for another on-ramp and practice more highway driving.

 It's best to start when you know the highway will not be crowded. Weekends and evenings are best. Pay attention to the traffic reports in your area. Make sure you know exactly where you're going and you don't have any place to go for a while.;
, Make sure you know all the laws and "rules of the road," including what different kinds of lanes look like and the local speed limits.
 Get the car inspected and fixed if necessary. The freeway is the worst possible place for a breakdown.
 Darkness and inclement weather make driving more difficult and should not be the beginner's first step.
 Don't take the on-ramp too fast, but when you come off it you should be going close to the speed of freeway traffic (whatever that may be at the time).
 You must watch for cars on the freeway and adjust your speed to enter the freeway safely. Although many people will change lanes to the left to give merging cars more room, it is not their responsibility to let you onto the freeway. Once you've safely merged onto the freeway, match your speed to the flow of traffic.
 Use your turn signal, mirrors, and glance at your blind spot every single time. Remember when driving on freeways that you should always stay in the furthest lane to the right unless you are passing a slower moving vehicle in front of you. You have probably seen signs which read, "KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS." If everyone followed this rule traffic congestion would be much less severe. If you are in the 'faster' lanes (left lanes) and there is a large space in front of you and many cars behind you YOU ARE OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC. Safely change lanes toward the right to allow traffic to pass. It is not your job to enforce speed limits by obstructing traffic on the freeway.
 Make sure to give them lots of room, and don't ever cut in front of anybody.
 As soon as the off-ramp breaks away from the main highway, start slowing down.
