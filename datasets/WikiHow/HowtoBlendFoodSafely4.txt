 This doesn't mean you cannot blend warm liquid; it does mean that you need to wait at least 5 minutes before transferring any hot liquid to the blender.A few minutes of waiting can mean all the difference between a safe blend and a scalding experience., Fill no more than halfway of the blender., The opened part should be opposite to where you are.

Note that it is the creation of a vacuum that causes explosive hot food or liquid problems in a blender., Blend just a few times to start with, and gradually build up the blending when you can see it is working well and safely.
