 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.
 Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.
 Blanching is a method that scalds herbs, vegetables or fruit so that their color and flavor will last when they are preserved.To blanch the parsley, use tongs to dip sprigs of parsley into a pot of boiling water briefly and swirl them around. Pull out the parsley when the color brightens.


The blanching step can be skipped, but the parsley will likely have less flavor and may have a gray-green color.
 This will stop the parsley from cooking after being in contact with boiling water.
, Be careful not to overflow the ice cube tray with water. Alternatively, put the chopped parsley in small freezer bags.
, Use within 4-6 months.
