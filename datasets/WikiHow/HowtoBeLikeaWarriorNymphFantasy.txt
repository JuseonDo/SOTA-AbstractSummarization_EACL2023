 eg: Forest nymph, water nymph, dark nymph, you can even be a city nymph! It doesn't matter, adapt it to your situation, personal style and preference.;
, For example: If a water nymph appeals to you, make the effort to go swimming, learn about the sea, meditate on the sound of the waves, become the actual nature of the water element. The more comfortable you are with your element the better. It can be quite helpful in certain situations to know a specific environment in depth. Similarly it makes you a more observant and intuitive person.
 Nymphs come in all shapes and sizes but you do need to make sure that you maintain a healthy strong body. Eat plenty of fruit and veg, eat whole foods such as brown rice and quinoa. Drink plenty of water or fresh fruit juice to hydrate yourself. Nymphs have strength and stamina and a good diet will support this, but hey, life is for living, allow yourself a treat once in a while!

, Try aerobic workouts to burn fat and muscle workouts to tone and refine. Ballet is a great way to gain strength while still maintaining a refined shape. Because nymphs are always running around in complete control of their environment, it maybe a good idea to look into gymnastics or parkour, something where you can be flexible, like yoga.
 Make sure you maintain a good posture, learn to control your body's movement, considering footwork and balance.
 Just because you're graceful does not mean you can't pack a punch! Try out archery or self defense, become in control of your own strength.
 Not always mean in the classical sense , being quick-witted and streetwise also apply.
 If you are a forest nymph it can be quite difficult climbing trees in tight leather hot pants!

, Nymphs are spiritual beings, aware of their environment, it is an essential part of their character.
