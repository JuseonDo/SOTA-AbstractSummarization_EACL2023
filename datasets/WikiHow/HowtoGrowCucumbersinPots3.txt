 Select the two tallest seedlings and let them stay. Snip the other seedlings down to the surface of the soil. Do not yank the other seedlings out, since doing so will disturb the soil and may cause damage to your other seedlings.
 Keep the taller, stronger of the two, and snip the other one down to the surface of the soil.
 Cucumbers need 8 hours of direct sun exposure, at minimum, to fulfill light and heat requirements.
 If the surface of the soil seems dry, it may be time for re-watering. Give mature plants enough water so that a little extra drains out from the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot. Never allow the soil to dry out, since dry soil will inhibit growth and lead to a bitter crop.
 Drench the soil first before adding the fertilizer, since adding the fertilizer when the plants are dry may create problems. Use a water soluble fertilizer, and apply as much as the label directs you to use.
 A little breeze can be good for your cucumbers, but strong winds can damage the plant. Placing your pot near the side of your house or by a fence can minimize potential wind damage.
 Aphids, pickle worms, mites, and cucumber beetles will all target your cucumber plant. Use neem oil or another organic pesticide to drive away and kill these insects.
 Mildew and bacterial wilt are especially common. Many anti-fungal products will rid your plants of mildew, but you may have a more difficult time improving plant health if you cucumbers get a bacterial disease.
 Bigger cucumbers are bitterer. Snip the stem about 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) above the cucumber.


Most cucumbers are ready to harvest within 55 to 70 days after planting.
