 You don't want something elaborate that will go out of date quickly when the person who set it up goes off to college. Don't set up pages for "Weekly Sermon Topics", "Upcoming Events" or "Calendar" unless you have someone willing to update the content every day, week or month.;
,, You might want to label it "How to find us", so that visitors don't confuse it with the site map page. See the related article, "How to Design the Map Page for a Simple Church Web Site".
 It might have a biography, a welcome statement from him/her and a picture or him/her.

 Especially if you are not associated with any particular denomination, give people an idea of where you stand.
