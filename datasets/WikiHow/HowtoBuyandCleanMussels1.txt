 Pick mussels that have securely closed shells. Bypass mussels that have their shells open and that will not close. An open shell itself does not mean the mussel is automatically bad. Mussels left undisturbed will open their shells slightly. If a shell is open, tap it. If the mussel closes the shell, it is still alive. If the mussel does not close its shell, discard it.;
, The shells of the mussels should be damp and shiny. They should smell like the ocean.
, Pass on mussels that seem too heavy or too light when you pick them up.
