 The best or youngest tires should go on the front of your vehicle. When rotating tires from the back to the front, its important to keep tires on the same side of the car.;
, Always have your car professionally aligned when you change your tires.
, Before working with a battery, remove any metal objects, such as a ring or watch, which can cause a spark.
 The battery load is how much electricity the battery can store without having to be recharged. This is particularly important if your battery is more than 2 years old.
 Use the fluid brand recommended by your owner's manual. If you need to fill more than 2 ounces of brake fluid, consider getting the brakes inspected for leaks and wear by a mechanic. You may need a complete flush and re-fill.


If you do need a flush and re-fill, have the mechanic check your vehicle's brake pads and brake shoes, as well.
 If you find any, replace all of the hoses at once.
 If you need more than 2 ounces, take it to a mechanic to be checked for leaks. Have the mechanic flush out the old power steering fluid and replace it.
 Since should get an oil and oil filter change every 3,000 to 4,000 miles (4,800 to 6,400 km), as well, you can check your wipers at the same time. Make sure to measure your blades before replacing them so you know which size to get.

 Low freon can decrease your car's performance and cause damage to its air compressors. Only a trained professional can add freon to your vehicle since it is a high-pressured gas.
 Your manual should also tell you what type of transmission fluid and filter to use. Some vehicle models may require a special additive, as well.
 Use soap designated for cars. Do not use dish or other household soaps, as these can deteriorate your vehicle's paint. Wax your car every other year.
