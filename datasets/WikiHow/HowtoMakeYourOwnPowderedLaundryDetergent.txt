, You can grate by hand and chop with a rounded bowl chopper or just mix in the other ingredients with the grated soap and not worry about the chopping. Use of the processor makes the whole thing easier and chopping makes keeping it easier to keep the product mixed.
 Mix and keep mixing until everything is evenly distributed. A single batch can be mixed in the processor.
 For very heavily soiled clothes, you may use additional detergent.
