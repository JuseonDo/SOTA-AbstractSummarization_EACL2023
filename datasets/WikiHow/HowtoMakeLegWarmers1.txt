 If you don’t own a sweater you want to deconstruct, you can find them for $1 to $10 at a thrift store.


Choose wool sweaters, if you want the most durability. You will need to wash them by hand to avoid changing the texture.
Choose acrylic if you don’t need to wash sweaters regularly. Many acrylic blends tend to pill over time.
Choose cotton blends for the easiest care and durability.;
, Choose a portion just outside of the shoulder hem. You can reuse the remaining sweater for other projects.
 Smooth them down so there aren’t any creases.
, You can wear them pulled straight or scrunched up. If you want a shorter leg warmer, you can cut your top line lower on the sleeve.
