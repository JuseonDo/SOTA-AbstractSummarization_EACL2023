, If using candles, you want a dark room. If using items that reflect light, then you need a bright light source shining on the objects (the camera flash alone may be adequate).,,, Focus on one particular item in the group., Also notice the interesting effects that the lighting causes with the out-of-focus items. Adjusting the lighting will alter the effect. Notice in the example above that the fourth candle is the focus object, and each of the other candles produces interesting lighting effects.
