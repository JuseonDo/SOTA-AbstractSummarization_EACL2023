 Textured hair is more manageable when thoroughly wet. Warm water opens the cuticle to allow products to penetrate hair strands.
 Run your fingers gently through your hair to separate knots and kinks. Do not use a brush or a comb, this could lead to unnecessary breakage and shedding. Starting at the roots of your hair may cause breakage, even with gentle finger detangling.

Try to get all of the shed hair out; shed hair often has no way to actually fall out of your hair so it stays mixed in with the healthy hair and creates knots.
 Shampooing the hair strands may lead to over dryness, and if you are planning on blow-drying your hair this could very likely lead to breakage. 

Only shampoo your scalp once or twice, or it could lead to flakiness. Warm water opens the hair cuticle to allow shampoo to fully cleanse.
,, Apply the oils or conditioner by running the product thoroughly through your hair. You can use a store bought deep conditioner or make your own. Use all natural, 100% organic virgin oils.,, Rinsing with cold water will close the hair cuticle and retain moisture.
