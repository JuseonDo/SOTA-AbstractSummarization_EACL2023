buy a harness for your dog.

@summary
get your dog's favorite toy and treats as leads.

@summary
start your training in an area with few distractions, and after your dog has already exercised in some way (playing fetch with you, running in the park, etc.),

@summary
every time your dog looks away, say his name excitedly, shake the toy or treat, and say "let's go!",

@summary
if the dog gets ahead of you and starts to pull, take a few steps backwards (look behind you, first!),

@summary
use lots of praise with your dog, as long as the leash is loose.

@summary
if your dog is consistently pulling, you may want to try using a head halter; these work very well also if your dog is comfortable wearing it (it may need to be desensitized first).

@summary
,

@summary
remember that you need to give your dog enough slack in the leash that is loose when the dog is walking close to you.

@summary
remember, do not use any harsh discipline like hitting, jerking on the leash or yelling when your dog doesn't follow.

 Pulling a dog by the neck using a choke chain is incredibly uncomfortable. Also a tugging dog will deny itself oxygen when it's pulling on the lead. The harness fits under the front legs, across the chest and over the back. It will be much more comfortable for the dog and will give you more control. The lead should clip onto a ring in the middle of the back. There are also front-clip harnesses where the leash attaches at the middle of the dog's chest that can greatly reduce pulling.;
, This will lure your dog into following you around and, it will teach him to hold his head high, since he will be looking at you and the treats.


, (excitedly), treat him, and he will keep walking.
 until the dog is moving back towards you again and is at your side. At that time start walking forward again - the dog should be at your side and you should immediately praise and reward your dog.
 He will be happier with praise and a food or toy treat than he will be with any of those alone.
, If you hold the dog close to your side with a tight leash, it will be very difficult for the dog to learn to walk without pulling.
 Heel is a command that takes being tender, loving, and having patience. If your dog doesn't follow, do step three again, and if he does, but then starts pulling again say a soft yet stern "No Max", and continue.
