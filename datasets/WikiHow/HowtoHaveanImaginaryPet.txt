 Make a pretend phone call to a breeder, and ask them to deliver it to your house. Ask them to bring supplies.;
, Think of all of the items as free, so it won't be awkward when you "pay" for them at the cashier.
 If you have trouble thinking of a creative name for your pet, just look some up online.
 A long day of being shipped and/or shown around its new surroundings can be tiring for your new imaginary pet. And since this will be its new home forever, you have time.
 Teach the pet how to sit, climb, etc.
 Take it out on holidays and to different places. If you can, take it everywhere you go, even to school (just make sure your pet is quiet when the teacher is teaching). You can let it frolic wherever it likes, otherwise; but make sure it is not causing any trouble.
