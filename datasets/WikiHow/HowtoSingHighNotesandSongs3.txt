@summary
move higher up the scale in your falsetto voice until you again hit the top of your range.

 Be aware of where in your head you are making the sound resonate. The sound should be projected forward and should resonate in your sinuses around your nose and forehead, not in the back of your throat.
 Next open your mouth to an, “ahhhh,” sound. Make sure to keep the same feeling of resonance in your head for both closed and open sounds.
 When you reach your vocal break, switch to your falsetto voice tone and continue. Work on having a clean switch between the two tones.
 Focus less on the actual note and instead on producing on a clean, crisp sound and resonance as you move up the scale.
 Then try the next one. You’ll soon discover you can sing higher while practicing this exercise than you can while singing a song.
