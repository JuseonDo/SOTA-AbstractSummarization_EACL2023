 There's no sign-up bonus this time, but there's always the annual fee. Assuming the same $15,000 expenditure, ($15,000 X .01) - $80 = $70. Thus, your second-year return would be about $70.
 Look at other card offers and make comparisons.
 They may be willing to sweeten their offer, perhaps waiving the annual fee for one year.
