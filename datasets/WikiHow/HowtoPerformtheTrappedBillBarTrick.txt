 You will want to get the paper money as centered between the two bottles as possible. If the bill is off centered, your chances of success will be reduced.;
, Using your fingers to crease the bill, feel that the bottles are perfectly aligned. This is critical to the success of pulling your trick off.
 You will want to hold on to the left side of the bill, as pictured.
 Using your right hand, push down slightly on the bill, so that it forms a sort of "valley."

, With as much force as you can muster, bring your pointer finger down on the bill. When you are bringing your finger down, you will want to aim for the "valley" that we have previously created in the bill.
 You have successfully pulled the trapped bill trick off. Now drink your free beer, or if at first you did not succeed, give it another shot.
