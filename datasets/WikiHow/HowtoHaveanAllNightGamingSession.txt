 Plan on how you will get the food and wait for the right time to sneak it into your room. Wash some fresh fruits and vegetables and put them into small plastic bags in the fridge. You will be able to sneak these into your room a few hours before you begin.;
, There's no point in gaming without games, is there? If you cannot charge them, bring the chargers into your room.
 If you need an extra pillow, be sure to gather that ahead of time.
 Computer games are important, as well as console games.
 Obviously, do not use the mic if you could wake up your parents. The webcam is easy to use without getting caught. If you go onto www.tinychat.com with some friends and broadcast yourself playing games, you may get some helpful advice.
 These will make gaming at night quite a bit more entertaining.
 If you are not worried about printing at midnight, go ahead and bookmark the pages.
 Make sure your parents are asleep first, then you can play on your handheld device.
 If you do not have one that can be accessed at the moment, skip to the next step. Otherwise, pick one of your favorite games and play it for an hour.
 Grab a healthy and a salty snack. While eating, move to your console games and get comfortable. Bring your cell phone and music player.
 If you want to, pop in your headphones and multitask. It can help keep you awake.
 This will make you more awake and possibly be a bit nostalgic.
 To sum the night up, don't spend all your time in one place. Multiple activities are what keep you awake.
