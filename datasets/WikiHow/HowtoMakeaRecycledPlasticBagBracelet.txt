 These are listed below under the Things You'll Need list. Just be sure to choose plastic bags that won't decompose in the sunlight, or you'll end up with a disintegrating bracelet!

, (This part is often where it says the store name or logo.)

Cut three strips that are equal to each other in size but make them thick, so you have a strong bracelet.
Be sure not to include the handles.
The length is up to you. You can make the strips as long as you would like.
 Knot it just like you would if you were making a bracelet out of string.
, Push it all the way to the braid, not the knot. Then repeat four more braid and bead actions until your bracelet is long enough.
, Make sure you are able to slip your hand through the bracelet; as you tie, check that it fits. Enjoy your new bracelet!
