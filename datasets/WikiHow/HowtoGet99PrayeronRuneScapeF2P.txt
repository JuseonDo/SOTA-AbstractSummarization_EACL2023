 There is another chicken coop in the champion's guild but you can only access it if you are doing Dragon Slayer or if you have done Dragon Slayer. The coop in the champion's guild is better because there are not many people around and it is easier and faster to get the bones.;
, It is not hard because you do not need any food if you have 30+ defense and they are just lv.5

, There are many bone respawns there and you do not have to kill anything. Also they respawn pretty fast if you go on an average world. And there might not be many people burying bones there. But make sure you do not bring anything that you don't want to lose as there are revenants that might appear and attack you. But if you do ever get attack by a revenant while burying bones there, go pray at an altar which is also in the chaos temple and if you have 37+ prayer you can defend yourself against the rev's attack. This method can give you fast XP maybe even up to but it can get pretty boring at times so below we will continue.
 Hill giants give about 15 XP per bones and also, they are the best bones on F2P. Hill Giants are lv.28 so 50+ combat and adamant or rune armors are recommended.
