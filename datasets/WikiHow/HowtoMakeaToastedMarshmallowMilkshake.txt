 Use more than one skewer or do in rounds if there isn't enough room to leave adequate hand hold at one end.;
, Expect a little burning, it's what happens when you toast food like this and adds to the flavor. For safety's sake, hold the skewer with an oven mitt to protect your hands from heat.


If you can't toast this way, place the marshmallows on a baking sheet and broil (grill with heat topside down).
 Place on a saucer or similar.
 Add the scoops of vanilla ice cream and all but 2 of the toasted marshmallows.
 Blend until it looks reasonably smooth. This can take up to 5 minutes.
 Top with the spare roasted marshmallows.
