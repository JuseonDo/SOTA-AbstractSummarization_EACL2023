 There will be, of course, 5 gallons in the 5-jug. You must fill all the gallons up to the top, otherwise you don't actually know how much you have.
 You're left with 3 gallons in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.
 You're left with nothing in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.
 You're left with 2 gallons in the 3-jug. And nothing in the 5-jug.
 You now have 2 gallons in the 3-jug and 5 in the 5-jug. This means that there is 1 gallon (3.8 L) of space left in the 3-jug.
 Fill up the last gallon of space in the 3-jug with the water from the 5-jug. This leaves you with 3 gallons in the 3-jug, and 4 gallons in the 5-jug., You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water.
 You now have nothing in the 3-jug, and 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 5-jug.
 You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 3 gallons in the 5-jug.
 You now have 1 gallon (3.8 L) in the 3-jug and 5 gallons (18.9 L) in the 5-jug. This is because, in the last step, you only had 2 gallons (7.6 L) of space left over, so you could only pour 2 gallons.
 You now have nothing in the 3-jug and 1 gallon in the 5-jug

, You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 1 in the 5-jug.
 Simply pour over your three gallons into the 5-jug, which only had 1 gallon (3.8 L) in it previously. 1+3=4, and a successfully defused bomb.
