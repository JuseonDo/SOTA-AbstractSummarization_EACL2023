 You want to make sure the clothespins are placed directly next to each other (touching sides) so you don’t see the can underneath.
 Of course beforehand make sure the container will fit. If you are using the holder for candles use a glass holder (plastic will melt).
 This may mean that you either add dirt first and then plant seeds or you can transfer a plant directly from the temporary pot to your new holder.
