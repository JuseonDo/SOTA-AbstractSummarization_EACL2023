 If you have curly or wavy hair, you will probably want to create this hairstyle while your hair is still damp, so it will comb easily. This will hold better for any hair type if created on damp hair.

, Making sure the section is well divided from the rest of the hair, put it into a hair tie at the back of your hair.
 Include the small ponytail from the first section in the holder.
 (Include the small ponytail from your last section.) You're finished!








,, A number of options present themselves:

Use more or less sections, bobby pins instead of hair ties, or tie the sections loosely or tightly.













If you want to dress this style up, use bobby pins with sparkly studs or a pretty flower clip. Make the sections loose and perhaps leave the last undone. Using a lot of sections will make this look very intricate.













If you want to use this style for a sporting event, use a few sections and use ponytail holders that will stay in well.
