@summary
once your rockruff reaches level 25 during the daytime in pokémon sun or during the nighttime in pokémon moon, it will evolve into either midday form lycanroc (if you're playing pokémon sun) or midnight form lycanroc (if you're playing pokémon moon).

 It's found at the outside area of Ten Carat Hill, which is near your player's house. You need Tauros Charge to get there. You have a 20% chance of finding a Rockruff, which will be between level 10 and 13.;
, It shouldn't be too difficult for you to catch.
 Since Rockruff is a Rock-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Bug, Fire, Ice, and Flying-type Pokémon. For it to evolve, you'll have to train it during the daytime in Pokémon Sun, and during the nighttime in Pokémon Moon. Note that Pokémon Moon's in-game clock is 12 hours ahead of the 3DS' clock, so be sure to keep track of the time if you're playing Pokémon Moon.
