 If you are painting existing tile in your home, make sure that the colors you choose complement the rest of your design scheme. It is usually best to choose light colors when painting your tile, as dark or bright colors can overwhelm a room.


Ask yourself aesthetic questions. Do you want to fill up the entire tile space or simply paint one part of the tile? Both ways can be effective. One centered image of an animal, face, or object can look striking while a country scene, landscape, or cityscape would be a good way to fill the whole tile.
For a home surface, maybe you want to include an accent tile or a row of accent tiles that contain a pattern, picture, or word. Accent tiles can add beautiful variation and subtle color to a home tile surface.
 This is especially effective for intricate scenes or patterns. Be sure to press the pencil very lightly so that it is easy to hide with paint and/or erase if necessary.



If you are working on a whole home surface, apply several thin layers of paint, allowing the paint to dry in between coats.
, You can apply several coats if desired.
