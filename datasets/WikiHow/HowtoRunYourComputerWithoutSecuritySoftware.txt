 A large majority of viruses are written for Windows because of the fact that most people use Windows. Using a Mac or Linux operating system will drastically reduce your chances of getting a virus.;
, Using a guest account instead of your main account will typically limit exposure of your system to non-essential areas of your operating system.
 Again, because a large majority of people use Internet Explorer, most viruses exploit its vulnerabilities more often than Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.
 Do not use Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express.
 If a friend of yours sends an e-mail with the subject "Very funny" and the like, you may want to call them to verify that they did indeed send you an e-mail. If you do not have their phone number, it may be best for you to delete it to be safe.
 Note that there are vulnerabilities associated with links, even if using this technique. Overall, you should never click on a link that looks suspicious.
 Only turn on your network connection when you need online access.
