 You may need to use a third pillow if you are making a bed for a large dog.
 You will probably need to sew by hand to avoid jamming the pillow into your sewing machine.
 Depending on the strength of your sewing, you may want to sew the pillows together on top where they meet in little valleys. This will help the pillows stay together and also create a more consistent shape.
 It helps to measure the pillows with a tape measure or yardstick and then transfer the necessary dimensions to a piece of fabric before cutting. Make sure to account for the height of the pillows by adding about four to six inches of extra fabric to each side of the cutout.


You can also lay the fabric over the pillows and mark where the fabric meets the pillow edges using a pen.
Alternately, you can use old curtains instead of purchasing new fabric to save money and recycle your old things.
 Drape one piece over the pillow and place the other piece underneath the pillow. Make sure that the edges of the fabric match up.
 You can either fold as you sew or pre-pin all four sides of the bed before sewing using safety pins or sewing pins.
 Make sure to leave one side open in order to stuff the pillows inside.
 Make sure that the bed is evenly stuffed corner to corner.
 Snip any loose threads.


If you are seasoned at sewing, consider attaching a zipper to the fourth side of the bed. This makes it easier to wash the covering without having to wash the pillows as well.
The bed can sit alone on the floor of your home, or you can place the bed in an adequately shaped box or basket for extra support and a more polished look.
If using a box or basket, you can also sew strips of fabric onto the side of the bed to act as ties. You can then tie the pieces of fabric to the box or basket to prevent the bed from sliding.
