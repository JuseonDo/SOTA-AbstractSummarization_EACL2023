 This icon has gray gears and is on your Home Screen.;
, It’s about halfway down the Settings menu.
 It's at the bottom of the menu. The button will turn white, and your iPhone will now send images in their original format.


Taking your phone out of Low-Quality Image Mode will significantly increase the data required to send images.
This will not affect images that you receive, and you may still get images with lowered resolution from others if they have Low-Quality Image Mode enabled.
