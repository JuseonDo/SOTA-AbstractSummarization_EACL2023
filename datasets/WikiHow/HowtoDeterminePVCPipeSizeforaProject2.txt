@summary
schedule 20 pipes (also called dwvs) are the least rigid pvc pipes.

@summary
1/2 inch (1.27 cm) plumbing grade pvc pipes are also extremely flexible, but they lack strength and can kink when bent.

@summary
3/4 inch (1.91 cm) plumbing grade pvc pipes are very bendable and ideal for any project that requires flexibility, like green houses, pet agility hoops or other curved frames.
@article

They are suitable for non-pressurized or low pressure plumbing applications like irrigation systems, sanitary drainage, or for construction projects where flexibility is more important than structural strength.
 They works well for kites and other light structures.

The actual exterior diameter of a 1/2 inch PVC pipe is not 1/2 inches, but rather 0.840 inches (2.133 cm).
 These pipes will spring back to their original shape if bent.


The actual exterior diameter of a 3/4 inch PVC pipe is not 3/4 inches, but rather 1.050 inches (2.67 cm).
