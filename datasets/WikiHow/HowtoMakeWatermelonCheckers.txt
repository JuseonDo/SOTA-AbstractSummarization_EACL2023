This is a good time to remove pieces that are lopsided or of the wrong size â€“ cut more if needed, or simply reshape existing pieces.
Also remove any obvious seeds from the watermelon pieces, if you haven't used seedless watermelon.
 Use a very small cookie cutter or a small shooter glass turned upside down to cut out the checkers from the watermelon. Cut slices thinner than for the checkerboard squares.


Push all the way through to ensure that the checker piece comes away clean from the watermelon flesh.



As with the watermelon checkers, cut the slices thinner than cheese squares for pushing the cutter through.
 Place the watermelon checkers onto cheese pieces, and cheese checkers onto watermelon pieces, as this makes them easier to see and it looks more effective. Your watermelon and cheese checkerboard is ready for serving!


It's a good idea to provide toothpicks to enable guests to pick up the cheese and watermelon pieces easily.
