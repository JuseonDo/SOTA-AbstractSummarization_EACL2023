 After this time passes, stick a toothpick into the muffins to see if the insides are solid. If they're still mostly liquid, then bake the muffins for an additional 5 minutes and test them again. If they're still gooey, keep baking them and checking every 2 minutes or so until they're ready.

 Enjoy these delicious muffins as part of your breakfast or as a tasty snack during any time of day.
