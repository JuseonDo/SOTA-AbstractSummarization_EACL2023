@summary
please do not defecate in the snow.

@summary
instead, walk until you find dirt, or pack it out (double-bagged with kitty litter, or in a poop-tube).
@article
 When the snow melts someone else will find your "present", as well as there is a possibility that the run-off, mixed with feces, will contaminate a water source.;

Alternatively, if you are camping on a glacier, find a small, deep crevasse.
