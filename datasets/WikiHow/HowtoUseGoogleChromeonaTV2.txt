 If you have an Android device, you can cast your entire desktop to a TV using a Chromecast. When your desktop is cast to the TV, you’ll be able to run Chrome and any other app on your device.
 When you set up your Chromecast, you likely installed Google Cast from the Play Store. If not, the next several steps will walk you through setting up Google Cast for the first time.
 If you don’t already have Google Cast installed, get it now.
, When the app starts for the first time, you’ll complete a quick setup process., You won’t be able to proceed until you do.
 After you complete the sign-in, you’ll arrive at the main Google Cast screen.
,, A numerical code will appear on your television screen. The same code will also appear in Google Cast. Tap “I see the code” in Google Cast to continue.
 The next screen gives you the option to give your Chromecast a recognizable name. Type something into the blank, and then tap “Set Name.”


If this is not your first time using the Chromecast, this information should already be set. You can tap “Set Name” to save the name that’s already there.
 Google Cast will now prompt you to connect the Chromecast to a Wi-Fi network. After this, the app and Chromecast will be ready to use.


If you’ve never used the Chromecast, enter your Wi-Fi network info into the provided blanks and tap “Set Network.”
If your Chromecast has already been connected to Wi-Fi, just tap “Set Network” on the settings already listed.
 Once the setup is complete, you’ll arrive at the app’s main screen. Tap the ⋮ to view the app settings.,, In a few seconds, your Android desktop should appear on the TV.
 Like any other app, the contents of Chrome will now appear on the TV screen.


As you browse the web, each page you click to will appear on the TV screen until you disconnect from the Chromecast.
 To stop casting your Android desktop to your TV:


Swipe down the notification drawer from the top of the screen.
Tap “Disconnect.”
