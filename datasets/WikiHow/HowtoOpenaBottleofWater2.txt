 You might have one lying around the house, but if not, purchase a pack at your local convenient store.
 The rubber band will act as an extra grip.
 Be sure the rubber band is fully wrapped around the cap and is tight. The rubber band's lengths should be equally spaced., Apply all your pressure into breaking the seal. It should crack once this is finished.
 Once the seal is broke, you should be able to remove the bottle's cap with ease. Now enjoy the water.
