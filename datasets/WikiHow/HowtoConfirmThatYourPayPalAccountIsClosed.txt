Note: The removal process will be applied to whichever account you are logged into at the time, so make very sure that you are logged in to the right account.
, Revisit the PayPal webpage and try logging in. You should get this error message: "Please make sure you enter your email address and password correctly. If you still can't log in, please see the Troubleshooting Tips below."


At this  point, you can be fairly certain that the account has really been closed, but not entirely. You might simply have made a mistake typing your email address or password.
 After getting the error from the previous step, there should be an option to recover your password, like: "Forgot your email address or password?"

, You should be redirected to a page which asks you for the exact account problem you might be having.
 A drop-down box should appear just below that option.
, At the very bottom of the page should be a captcha (a security image containing a sequence of characters). Input the captcha correctly and click continue.
 If the account has really been closed, you should get this error message from PayPal, "We couldn't find your email address. Please try again or select I don't know what email address I used."


There is no need to worry. It simply means that the email address is not recognized by PayPal's search engine, your account has been successfully deleted from PayPal's database.
