 Spend time thinking about this. Every figure has a different body structure and requires time to learn. Focus on one to begin with.;
, Different views and styles of your chosen figure. Look for side views, front views and back views as well as different artists styles of each.
 Now take that picture and re-draw it as best you can. Take your time. Don't trace the picture. You don't learn anything from tracing the picture. Keep in mind the style of the picture and try to mimic that as well if you can.
 Keep repeating until you feel you have a hold of of the figure and your style.
 See how well you create your own image and style.
 Work towards better art and improving skill.
