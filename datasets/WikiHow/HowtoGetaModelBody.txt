, Measure your weight, hips, bust, waist, know your dress size etc. You can also take some pictures if you want. This encourages you as you go on and helps you determine your rate of progress.
 See a nutritionist, go online, ask around, and get a diet plan that will help you put on, get rid of, or maintain the weight you desire.
 Go to a gym near you, get a personal trainer and tell him/her what you want. You can also work out on your own at home, but whatever you do make sure you get regular cardio (you can get this through activities like dancing, and some sports like boxing, table tennis), and you tone your body. Cardio gets your heart rate up and develops muscles, while toning shapes the muscles to give you a sleek and sexy shape. If you need to work on a particular area of your body, do so, but do not forget that you have to exercise your whole body as well to stay in good shape. Make sure you work out regularly, and often, to get results.
 Take care of yours by eating lots of fruits, and drinking lots of water. Avoid foods with lots of fats or oils as this make the skin oily and gives pimples(zits). Do not use soaps and lotions that are harsh on your skin; avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. Any scars you wish to get rid of? See a dermatologist, as whatever treatment you get is peculiar to the skin type you have.
 You have to stick to your diet and exercise regularly. You can put up pictures of the body you're aiming for to inspire you. One thing you should always do is visualize yourself with that body. It generally makes things easier, and helps you see your body changes faster.
 Tell a friend or family member, several if you want to, about your plans. It should preferably be someone who sees you often, so that you don't just lie to the person through the phone.
