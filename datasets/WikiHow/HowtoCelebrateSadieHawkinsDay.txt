 If there's no dance at your school, or if you aren't even in school at the moment, have your own hillbilly party! Li'l Abner was a comic that featured a clan of hillbillies living in the mountains of Alabama, so do your best to emulate them (unless you think it's mean and would prefer to dress normally).


Make a Hillbilly Costume;
, This recipe comes from yet another book published by the comic strip author with more recipes from the comic strip.
 College students are the ones who truly started Sadie Hawkins day (201 colleges had footraces, which influenced many clubs, churches, and army camps to do the same). Maybe you could even get your church, school, or just a group of people to enter the footrace.
 It won't improve your spelling or grammar, and you might even find it offensive. However, it can be interesting reading old comics!

, Invite all of your friends over and have a sleepover, watch old movies, whatever you like.
