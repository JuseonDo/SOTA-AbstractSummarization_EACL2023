, While some people may like to even freeze the carrots, the cold temperature in the refrigerator could keep them cool enough to soothe sore puppy teeth.
 You don’t want him to think you are rewarding his behavior with a treat so delivering the carrot before he gets too mouthy is key.
 In order to assert your dominance over the pup, he or she will need to “work” for everything earned. If your pup doesn’t know how to sit yet, hold the carrot over his or her head so that the puppy has no choice but do back down into a sit position.
