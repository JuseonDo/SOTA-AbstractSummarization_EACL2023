The easiest way to do the latter is to measure how long the current brackets are.


If you don't have a stud finder, tap gently across the wall. The drywall will sound hollow between studs, and firmer as you're knocking over the stud itself.
 Hold the new brackets in place over the studs, supporting the rod so it lays flat, and mark the location of the mounting holes on the drywall with a pencil., Remove the rod and screw-mount the new brackets in place., The new brackets will help support it along its length, preventing or at least reducing sag.
