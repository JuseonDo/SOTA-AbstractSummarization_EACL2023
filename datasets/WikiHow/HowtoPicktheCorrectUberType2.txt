 Uber offers different levels of service in different areas depending on the demand for Uber in that area. So if you live in an area where Uber does not operate widely, you may only have access to uberX and one or two other services.
 From the home screen of your smartphone, tap on the Uber icon.
 If you are taken to a login screen, tap "Sign In" at the bottom-left corner. Then, enter the e-mail address and password associated with your Uber account and tap "Done" or "Enter" on your keyboard to sign in.
 At the bottom of your screen, look for a bar with a number of notches that are labelled with the names of different types of Uber services. These are the services available in your area.
 This will select the type of Uber you will be ordering.
 Tap the black "Set Pickup Location" pin in the middle of your screen to confirm your pickup address.
 Tap on the "Destination Required" bar at the top of your screen and type in the address or name of your desired dropoff point.
 Tap the black button at the bottom of your screen to request your Uber. Once a driver responds to your request, it'll be on its way!
