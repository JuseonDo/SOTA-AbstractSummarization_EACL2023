 If you don't have one, buy one. They only cost 1,000 gems.;
, Just about almost everything on Animal Jam will look adorable on a bunny. Wear a head flower, woven shoes, pink purse, a cape or blanket, necklaces (lollipop, original,etc.), heart locket, beanie, tiaras, etc. Don't wear anything like huge skulls, bat wings, fox hats, swords, etc. because some people are less likely to adopt you unless people want a demon bunny or whatever.
 Saying things like "gets out sword and slices something in half" won't get you adopted as fast-or at all for that matter unless people are looking for demon bunnies or something.
, Otherwise, the person will unbuddy you and lock you out of their den. Then you'll have to start all over again.
 Buy one for 1,000 gems if you don't have one already.
