 Make these types of preferable reading material easily available in your home, office, car etc. This will help stimulate their interest, hence also improving their learning abilities.
 Be there to guide and motivate them. Always bear in mind that each person is unique. Their attitude and approach to learning may differ from yours.

 Laborious and boring educational activities will only hinder the learning process. One can read a story to children in a favorite picnic spot. Introduce games like solving riddles. This can be very effective in educating and also provides a form of entertainment.
