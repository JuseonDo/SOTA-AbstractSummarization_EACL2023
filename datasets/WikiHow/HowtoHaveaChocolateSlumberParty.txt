 You don't want to plan everything out and then have your parents say no. Before you do anything, check with your parents! Then, you are free to start preparing.;
, It's going to be pretty hard on them while you're munching on your Mars bars and they have to sit in the corner eating lettuce.
 Do not forget chocolate! Tell your guests to bring their favorite sort of chocolate.
 If your walls are brown or orange, bonus. Brown helps everyone get into the mood. It is a CHOCOLATE party, after all.
 If you have spare beds, that's comfy. Slumber party beds and mats are nice too. Fold-A-Beds - not so much unless you mind sharing.
 If it's only that, your friends will get bored and want to eat something else. Put some fruits and candies there as well. Play games like: Truth Or Dare, Would You Rather, Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly, etc. If you have Wii's or 3DS's, connect them and play a multiplayer game together. If you have a game console like Xbox 360 or PlayStation or even a computer, that's fine too.
 Comedies are good, but not a tearjerker, that could really bring down the mood. If you all like a certain book series, try to get the movie based on the book. Sheer fun. Twilight and HP are good.
 You can stay up all night, don't be the first one asleep. That's just dull and you miss out on all the gossip, but don't be the last one, either. Everyone will be mad at you for keeping them awake. Be 2nd or 3rd.
 Leave out any snacks that won't spoil overnight. This is just in case somebody needs a midnight snack.
