@article
 If it does, print it off and show it to people you know so they can perhaps explain it to you.;
, To do this, you say 'Kore wa ikura desu ka?' (pronounced korei wa ikura des ka?), which means "How much does this cost?"

, You put the numbers together like this: 19 is 10 + 9 so it is juu-kyuu (十九). 90 is 9 sets of 10 so it is kyuu-juu (九十). So 198 is hyaku-kyuu-juu-hachi (百九十八); a mouthful, but break it down and it makes a lot of sense the way the Japanese do it. 1198 is sen-hyaku-kyuu-juu-hachi (千百九十八).
 You can hail the staff by calling, "Onegaishimasu" (oh neh guy shee mas- meaning 'please') or "Sumimasen" (soo me masen- 'excuse me'). Many nicer restaurants also have a call button you can push to summon your waiter.
 If it's not working, you can also point and the staff should understand. If you have Japanese friends with you, either ask them to read it to you in advance or have them order.
 Hitotsu (one), futatsu (two), mittsu (three), yottsu (four), itsutsu (five), muttsu (six), nanatsu (seven), yatsu (eight), kokonotsu (nine), and Toh (ten). If you want more than ten of something, specify using normal numbers- juichi, juni, jusan, etc.
 If you are in a public fast food restaurant, use Kudasai. So it would sound like this. "Yakitori setto o hitotsu, kudasai." (One grilled chicken set, please.)

,', answer 'Hai'. You were asked 'Is everything ok?' and you replied 'Yes'.
 Family members pass the bones of the dead relative between chopsticks. If you really have to pass some food, do it discreetly and with the non-eating end of your chopsticks (if they are decorated, this is the decorated end).
, This is only done at funerals.
, 'Oishikatta desu' means "It was tasty."

, In this context it serves as a thank you for the meal.
