, Pick your desired snowflake color, and turn on Mirror across center and Spiral towards center. Then adjust the settings to 6-fold rotational symmetry.
 This will make a faint and small design.
 Click, hold, and drag from one of the edges to any other to connect your snowflake to itself.
 Observe as the color builds up as the streak gets longer - it will be bright where you are clicking, but as it gets longer it fades away.
, Move the dots toward the center of the snowflake. Start to build up some color there by using the above method. This gives the snowflake a more intricate feel.
 Add color by clicking repeatedly, or by holding and dragging.
 You can stick to two, or you can use all of them.
 You could change the fold rotational symmetry, turn off Mirror across center or Spiral towards center, or try different ways of holding and dragging. Keep working until the snowflake looks right to you.,
