 If you don't have Bridge or Lightroom, you can still open multiple images as separate layers from within Photoshop itself. You don't have to have an open file to perform this, as a new file will be created when you import the images.
 This will open a new window, allowing you to select files to add.
 You can use this window to find files anywhere on your computer to add to Photoshop. You can load as many files as you'd like into this window.
 A new file will be created, and each image that you selected will be loaded into a separate layers. If you are loading a lot of images, this could take a while.
