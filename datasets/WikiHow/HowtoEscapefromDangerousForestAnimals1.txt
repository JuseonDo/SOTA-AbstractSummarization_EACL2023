,, If you have children, pick them up and put them on your shoulders to appear taller.
,, Never crowd a bear.
 If the bear follows you, stop and hold your ground.



When attacked: stand your ground. Don't run away as this will tempt the bear to chase you, and you won't be able to outrun a bear anyway. Don't try to climb trees, either - bears are better climbers than you are.
, All mothers are protective of their babies, so it is likely that if you seem innocent enough the attention will be diverted back to the infants.


Use pepper spray.






Once a bear actually makes contact, surrender. Assume a defensive position and curl into a ball and stay still. Often, after a bear thinks the threat has been removed, it will leave. If the bear leaves, stay motionless for as long as possible. It may react if you regain composure when its back is turned.






Fight back if they continue to attack. Some bears have been driven away by people using their hands, rocks, and sticks to fight back. It is always important to dodge two main areas of the bear - the teeth and the claws. Therefore, you might see it as wise to make your way to the back of the bear and do your damage to the spine, which will lessen retaliation from its 'danger zones'.








(When standing your ground, try not to intimidate the bear, but rather, make yourself look important, like something the bear might injure itself with).
