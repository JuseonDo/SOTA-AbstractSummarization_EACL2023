,, Remember that Stereofame and other social music websites are new to some people. They might not understand the game part of Stereofame and they may not understand how to support you. So tell them to give you the "thumbs up," if they like your song. Tell them to sign-up so that they can support you. It's Ok. If they like your music, they will want to help you out.
 Introduce yourself to the world.
 If you are a musician, include your Stereofame homepage in all your fan communication and in your email signature.
