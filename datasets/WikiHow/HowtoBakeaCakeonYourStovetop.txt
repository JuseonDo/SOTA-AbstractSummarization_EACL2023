 It can go upon the small burner of your gas stove, if need be.;
, You can use a steel or aluminium big mouth cooking pot for baking, like - kadhai, big pan and dhokla maker. Now turn on flame and pre-heat your pot for five minutes

, Any aluminium or steel pot of flat and thick bottom with big open mouth will do. You can even use a useless saucepan as a cake mould.
 Dhokla racks are available with dhokla making pots, if you are using one, but if you are using any other cooking pot, then place a small plate upside down in the middle of your cooking pot.
 Then place the mould upon the stand/rack in cooking pot. Cover cooking pot with its lid and turn the flame to low.
