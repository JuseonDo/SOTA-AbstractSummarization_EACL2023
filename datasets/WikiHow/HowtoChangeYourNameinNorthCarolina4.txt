 If you want to change your surname back to a previous married name, you can request it in your divorce proceedings. Your divorce decree will order that your surname be changed as requested. A certified copy of your divorce decree should be all that you need in order to change the name on your social security card and with other offices.
 If you are divorced, you can still use your ex-husband’s surname again, as long as you share children with him. If you do not share children with your ex-husband, you cannot automatically resume using his name. You would have to go through the Civil Clerk’s Office process of giving notice and filing a petition for change of name in order to legally change your name.
 Most Clerk’s Offices have copies of these forms for you to complete. They usually are relatively simple to complete.
 You often will need to obtain a certified copy of the divorce judgment for this purpose. Attaching the judgment proves to the court that you are divorced and that you share children with your ex-husband. , The amount of this fee varies widely from county to county. You typically must pay court fees using cash or a money order.
