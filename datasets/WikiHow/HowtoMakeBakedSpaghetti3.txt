 For many servings, cook the whole package. For only a few servings, cook half. When cooked, strain and set aside.
 Pull out what needs using up, from leftover cooked veggies to beans and pieces of meat. Chop into small pieces.


Open a can of beans or lentils, rinse and add to the ingredient selection to make this more substantial.
 Briefly fry the chopped ingredients and herbs to freshen and enliven them again.
 At least a half bottle of pasta sauce is probably needed to coat the spaghetti. Judge it by what seems right. Mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper (freshly ground).
, If this is to be dairy-free, make a white sauce instead (ideal for vegans).
 Simply dump it in to fill the dish.
 Swish around with a wooden spoon or fork until the spaghetti is completely covered.
 Sprinkle with paprika to complete.
 Cook for 10-15 minutes at approximately 350ºF/180ºC. Don't overcook it, just long enough for the topping to start browning and bubbling.
 Serve using a pasta ladle. Add a side salad.
