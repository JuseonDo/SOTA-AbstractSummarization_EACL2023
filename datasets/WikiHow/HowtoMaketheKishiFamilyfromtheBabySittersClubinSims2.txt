  All members here must look Asian, as Claudia is Japanese.;
,  He should have the Knowledge or Fortune aspiration.  Dress John in a businesslike outfit.  Give him short hair.  Make sure he is nice, but somewhat serious.
  Her aspiration should also be Knowledge or Fortune.  She should also be nice.  Give her a conservative dress or skirt and blouse pair.
  Make sure she is nice and she has the Family aspiration.  Give her short, straight hair.  This Sim is optional because Mimi dies in book 26 of the series.
  As Janine in the books is a nerd and a genius, her aspiration MUST be Knowledge.  Give her glasses with dark rims, and relatively short, straight hair.  Make each individual item of clothing a conservative solid color (but the entire outfit may be different, though coordinated, solid colors for different pieces).  She has to be serious and neat.
  Make her aspiration Popularity or Romance (or Pleasure if you have Nightlife).  Give her long hair and a creative hairstyle.  She must be outgoing and playful.  Bright colors and/or unusual patterns are a must in Claudia's clothing, but keep the clothes matching - this is a Claudia trademark.
,,  This allows better Sim Objects.
  Also put a computer in the house.
  In the books, they have "smart" jobs.  Faithfully send Janine and Claudia to school each day.
  Only Claudia should have a toaster pastry for breakfast - cereal is best for the rest of the family.  Lunch is up for grabs.  TV dinners are a good dinner, as are instant meals, but only Claudia can have mac and cheese.  Claudia may have any snack option for snacks, but other family members can only have juice.  In the books, Claudia is a junk food fanatic, but the rest of her family eats fairly healthy.
