 My video is an LG V782NWK;
, I'm using a card with the PCI id "Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture", which is using the bttv driver.
 I'm using the Fedora 15, but as the commands are quite generic, any recent distribution should be ok.
 The procedure outlines temporarily stores uncompressed video on the harddisk which may occupy several hundred Gigabytes of data, depending on the length of your movie. A rule of thumb is that you need approx 1G for each minute of the video.
