 You will need to use some energy and scrub hard. It is possible that this is all your furniture needs. Sometimes a good washing will make a world of difference. Allow the furniture to dry.;
, Before you begin scraping, be sure to place the furniture on a piece of newspaper, or place it somewhere that the paint chips will not hurt the environment or make a mess. Discard this used newspaper properly when you are finished.
 Sand until the wood is smooth and clean. Again, you may want to place newspaper underneath the piece of furniture before you begin sanding. Sanding prepares the furniture for painting.
 Look through magazines or search home decorating websites to get an idea of what color you would like for your outdoor furniture to be painted. Try to choose a color you will be satisfied with for at least a year.
 Make sure the paint you purchase is weather resistant and for the outdoors. Consider getting a water based paint that is easier to clean up when you are finished painting. You may also want to look for a paint that is easy on the environment.
 If you are spray painting, you will need to be aware of the direction the wind is blowing. Once again, the furniture will need to be positioned on newspaper, cardboard or something that the paint will not damage.
 The first coat will count as the priming coat for the wooden furniture. Try to cover the furniture with the paint completely. It will help if the furniture dries between coats.
, Be sure pillows are made of weather resistant materials. Choose colors to compliment your clean and possibly newly painted or stained furniture.
