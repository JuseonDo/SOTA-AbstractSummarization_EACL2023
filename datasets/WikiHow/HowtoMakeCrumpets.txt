Remember: the amount of batter you will need to make a crumpet depends on the size of your crumpet ring. Aim to get the crumpet to a thickness of about ¾ of an inch.
 If holes do not form on the crumpet-to-be, add a little more warm water - one tablespoon at a time - to the batter in the bowl and try again. If the batter is too runny and leaks out under from underneath the ring, work in a little more all-purpose flour and try again. Once the batter is at the right consistency, cook the crumpets in batches of three.
 When the crumpet's top is covered with holes (this should take around seven minutes) it is ready to be flipped. To flip a crumpet, remove the ring using tongs, and then flip the crumpet with a spatula.
 Remove the crumpet from the griddle.
 You can go for a hot topping - like melted cheese or butter - or something colder like jam, or marmalade. If you're making the crumpets for more than just yourself, it's a good idea not to put the toppings on the actual crumpet but let the other people serve themselves - not everyone may enjoy marmite covered crumpets, after all.
