 You will need a Northwest Forest Pass in order to park at this trailhead.


If you're coming from Portland, take exit 40 from I-84. Make a right at the stop sign and a left when the road splits.
You might notice many people taking a right; this is the way to the Wahclella Falls trailhead, a much more popular hike.
Follow the road up the hill to the spacious trailhead parking lot.;
, Look carefully to your right for a junction with a trail going uphill.


It's marked by a sign that says "Tanner Butte Trail".
 Follow the trail to the right.


At this junction is a sign marked "Trail 400/Wauna Pt/Tanner Butte Tr".



Look for a sign that says "Gorge Trail 400" with arrows pointing left and right. Follow the trail to the right of that sign. It's as wide as a road and goes uphill. Most people will be going to Wauna Viewpoint by following the trail to the left, but you're up for a bigger challenge.
, Continue on the road you're on until you reach the junction with the Tanner Butte Trail, marked by a large trailhead board on your left, with waterfalls gushing behind it.
 You'll cross a few streams.
 Look for the unmaintained Wauna Point Trail #401D heading left. The trail is not easy to spot. You might need to step into the middle of the campsite to see it.


Once you find it, you will see a "trail not maintained" sign on a tree to the left of the trail.
If you see this on a tree on your right just after passing the campsite, you've gone a little bit too far.
 It will get more challenging as you get closer to Wauna Point, exercise caution. When you get to Wauna Point, you will be rewarded with panoramic views of the gorge. Don't look down!
