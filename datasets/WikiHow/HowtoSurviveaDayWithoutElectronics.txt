 Start by buying the things that you need, then buying the things that you want (the things you need are more important). You could buy items such as food, toys, and makeup. Avoid electronics.


Instead of going to a regular store, you could always visit a mall. Malls provide a wide range of variety to shop From.
Bath & Body Works is an example of a store you could go to.;
, Try mascara, eye shadow, and other cool styles with your hair.
 Your pet will love it if you play with him/her. For instance, throw toys on the floor and get your dog to catch them. Also, be affectionate; pet your pets and give compliments such as "Good dog". This is an entertaining way to pass the time.
 Try observing plants in your neighborhood, or taking a nature hike on the mountains, for instance. This type of relaxation is always enjoyable! Get Fresh air that will rejuvenate your senses and will feel all refreshed.
 Exercise is not only good for your health, but it can be fun too! Try taking a bike ride, walking around your block, or doing something else you enjoy probably running or some sports.
 Realize that mistakes happen, and no one is perfect.


Be sure to tell your parents sorry.
