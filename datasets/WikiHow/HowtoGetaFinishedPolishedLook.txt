 Wash your face, use some toner (if desired)and moisturize your face.;
, Put some foundation on your eyelids as a base for the eyeshadow. If you have eye base, then of course, use it.
 If you have dark circles under your eyes, conceal those as well.
, It makes the eyes look more "open". Find an eyeshadow that's a bit darker than your skin tone and sweep that all over your eyelids. Then apply some brown eyeshadow to the outer corners of your eyes.
, Clamp down on your lashes for 20-30 seconds for each eye.
 If desired, you can let it dry and apply another coat. Only apply to bottom lashes if you know what you're doing.
, If you want a hint of color, then use a soft, subtle pink lip gloss.
 Start with very little and add more gradually, as needed. Too much makes you look goofy. And blush isn't that easy to take off.
