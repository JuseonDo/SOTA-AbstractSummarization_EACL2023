, The installation is straight-forward. But i will go through Step by step. Click on Agree

, You can select all of them. Click Next

, Click Install(I always remove the company name, and select directory as c:\Program Files\Virtual Clone Drive. So that when I browse through Program Files later on, I know what each folder contains.)

, It may take some time to install, So be patient. After installation, Close the window. And open "Virtual CloneDrive" from Desktop Shortcut

, of Virtual Drives. You can have 1-2 drives depending upon your need. (You can set as many as 8 drives.)

,, Go to 'Virtual CloneDrive' and Click on 'Mount'.
 Now, you can access the Image, as if you have a physical Drive. You can access its files or run installation just like a CD/DVD drive.
