 This can be done by loading your Twitter homepage, and looking to the left of the tweets. There will be a section with your profile, near the top where it says, "Home." Go to the bottom, and at the center, under your username, should be a section that says, "Following," then lists the number of people you're following.;
, Twitter should load up a list of people you are following.
 Use these questions as a guide:


Do you look up to them?
Do you know them personally?
Are they a company or a person?
What made you follow them?
Do you still like them now?

, You will be able to unfollow by hovering over the "Following" button for them and the bar will turn red. It should say "Unfollow." Click to unfollow. Since you don't like them, it would be useless to read their tweets and have them clog up your Twitter feed.
 Some people will have two accounts, but will only use one most of the time. Unfollow the one that is less used.
 Most of those don't really "tweet," but instead, advertise themselves or list updates. You can get those updates by visiting their website, which they will usually list.
 If you only like one celebrity just because, then unfollow them. You should only follow the celebrities that you are very interested in.
 The general rule of thumb is to follow as many people as you have as followers. This will be hard if you are not very popular. If you only have about 9 followers, then you should try to keep the list of people you follow under 200, although 100 is preferred.
