 Season to taste with salt and pepper. Then sprinkle on the 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) of garlic powder, dried parsley, dried oregano and dried basil.;
, After you brown them, transfer the steaks onto a plate and set them aside.
 In the same pan that you fried the steaks, add the cooking wine, water, orange juice, and chopped garlic cloves and stir a little bit. Cook the sauce for about a minute.
 Put the onion rings on top of the steaks. As the dish cooks, the onions will release their juices onto the steaks, giving them a delicious flavor.


Cooking the steak longer in the sauce makes it more tender and more flavorful.
 Let the steak rest in the sauce for a few minutes and then bring the dish to the table. Dig in and enjoy!
