 Cut one square in half diagonally. Tape the two remaining squares together.Tape the triangles onto the squares so you have a standing triangle thing.
 Tape it to the square on the bottom. Fold it up so that it rests on the triangle. Then tape the two sides to the end triangle.
, Tape them upright on the long side of the triangle. Place one in the middle, and the others halfway between the middle and the edge.
 Then tape it to the posts.
