@summary
set up a rewards program.

@summary
leave the pacifier in the bed, as it is an aid to sleep.

@summary
never let the baby walk around with a pacifier in his mouth -- the baby is in the beginning stages of speech when they are walking and a pacifier can interfere with their ability to communicate.

@summary
,

@summary
another trick is to cut the nipple of the pacifier and the baby won't like it as much.

@summary
simply take it away.

@summary
use an older child as an example.

@summary
inform the child that there are other children that need binkies that are just being born.

@summary
propose a trade of a toy for a pacifier.

 Give your child a star each day they go without, and after they have (x) number of stars consistently, they can get a treat, like a Popsicle, or even going to the movies.;
, This should be started when the baby is under one.
, Cut a little more every few days.
 This will upset the child for a few days, and they may dislike you for about a week. But after that, they won't remember. And you can have a huge sigh of relief because you don't have to deal with it anymore. This is most effective for younger children, who can't understand a reward system like a 3-5 year-old could.
 Even a cartoon character, like Dora the Explorer would work. You just have to say, "You don't see your cousin Sam with a Binky, do you? That's because he's a big boy. And you want to be a big boy don't you?" often works. Using a model can help them begin understanding comparisons earlier than say, preschool.
 Send him out to hang them on a tree,or to hide them throughout the house, so that the Binky fairy can pick them up. Keep a close watch to see where he hid them, and then get them that night. Leave a small gift, something cheap and plastic but that the child will like, in each child's place.
 Say, "Well, (child's name), I don't know... That's a toy for big kids. How about we trade? You give me your pacifier, and I'll buy you the toy." It really works, especially on girls.
