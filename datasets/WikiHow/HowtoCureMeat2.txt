 Wet-brining is great for ham or other smoking recipes. Try wet-curing your Christmas ham, for example, and then finishing it off in the smoker for a delicious recipe.
 Making a simple brine, and then adding the nitrites in the curing salt (which will cure the meat) is all it takes to wet-cure meat. Try this basic brine recipe, or research brines with added nitrite for a different kind of taste. In one gallon of water, bring the following ingredients to a boil and then allow brine to cool completely:


2 cups brown sugar
1 and 1/2 cups kosher salt
1/2 cup of pickling spice
8 teaspoons of pink salt (not to be confused with sodium nitrite)

, A brining bag is essential for larger cuts of meat, like a Christmas ham. Smaller cuts of meat can simply go in resealable freezer bags, but make sure that there's enough room for the meat and brine to rest comfortably in. For larger cuts of meat, Place the brining bag in a larger tub or container first, and then fill with brine. Add 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of ice water to the brine to dilute the concentrated brine. Mix thoroughly before sealing.
 If you have a five pound piece of meat, brine for approximately two and a half days. Turn the meat every 24 hours if possible. The salt in the brine tends to be thicker on the bottom half of the brine and turning the meat allows the brine to work evenly.


Change the brine after 7 days during the curing process to help prevent spoiling.
,, Wet-cured meat, such as ham, is great after smoking. Smoke your wet-cured meat in a smoker and serve on a special occasion.
