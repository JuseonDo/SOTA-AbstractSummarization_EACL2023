@summary
cut through the wheat field (you'll want a lot of bread when you're invading enemy forts later).

@summary
start mining iron.

@summary
craft a furnace (and a chest, if you didn't find one while mining) and start smelting the iron.

@summary
once you have 26 iron ingots smelted, craft some armor and a sword.

@summary
put on the armor, craft bread from the wheat you got in the fields, place spare resources in your hidden chest, and wait for the walls to fall.

 You should have a pickaxe at least. Hit the dig pit, all the maps have them. If you are good and can get a lot of coins (as of EULA), you should have an advantage with the pickaxe.;
, You'll also want cobblestone (for a furnace) and coal (for furnace fuel), so don't neglect these.
 While you wait for it to smelt, find a good hiding place for your chest. Note: If you are VIP or higher, your first three chests will receive a protection. Ditto for furnaces.
 You should also get spare for your chest. That means when you die, you can go, get gear and go rush/kill farm again with full gear!
