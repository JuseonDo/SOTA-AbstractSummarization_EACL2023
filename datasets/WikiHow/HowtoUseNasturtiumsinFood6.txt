 While not essential, it's more effective to choose a variety of colors for variation., Any soft cheese, dip or guacamole will make an ideal stuffing., Gently fold the petals back around the stuffing, the stickiness of which should hold the petals in place., The stuffed flower goes on top of the toast or cracker for ease of eating and completes the texture perfectly.

Alternatives to toast or crackers include slices of cucumber, sticks of celery or slivers of capsicum/bell peppers.
The stuffed flower can be eaten alone if desired.
