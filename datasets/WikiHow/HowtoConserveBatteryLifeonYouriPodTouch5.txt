 "Settings" is the grey gear icon--it should be on your iPod's home screen.
 This is located right underneath the "General" tab.
 Auto-brightness brightens or dims your display based on how much ambient light your iPod detects, but it's a huge battery-drainer., This will dim your display.
 You can adjust your display brightness at any time from the quick-access menu, which is accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.
