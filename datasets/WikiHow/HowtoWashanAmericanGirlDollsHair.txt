 Cover her eyes with a towel, because if they get wet they can rust!;
, Begin by rinsing her hair gently and thoroughly. Do this until her hair hair is soaked all the way through.
 Lather it up gently with your hands so that the shampoo gets in deeply. Start at her hairline and go down to the very ends.
 If it is cloudy you are not done rinsing yet.
 Gently massage it into her hair. After you rinse it out, gently comb the hair where the knots are to get them out, but do not comb ALL the hair yet

, Do not squeeze the hair, just press lightly on the towel until the hair is generally dry. Then, gently comb through the hair. Lay her somewhere to dry, and Voila! you have washed her hair!
