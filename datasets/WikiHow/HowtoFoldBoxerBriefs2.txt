 The band should be at the top.
 Fold it down approximately 2 inches (5 cm). You want it to be folded around the entire perimeter of the boxer briefs, so you will need to lift the top back of the boxer briefs up to complete the fold.









Smooth the boxer briefs down again.
,, Try to roll as tightly as possible. The tighter the roll, the smaller the bundle will be.
 Flip the band back over the rolled briefs to secure them tightly. Pack them on their side in your drawer or place them in your luggage.
