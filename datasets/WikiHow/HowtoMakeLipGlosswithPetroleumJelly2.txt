 Fill a medium-sized bowl with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a heat-safe bowl on top. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water.









Try to use a glass bowl. It will help things heat more evenly.
 The shea butter and coconut oil will moisturize your lips, while the petroleum jelly will hold everything together.









If you can't find coconut oil, try some jojoba oil or almond oil instead. Both are very moisturizing.
If you can't find or don't like shea butter, try cocoa butter or coconut butter instead. Both will give the lip gloss a subtle taste.
 Stir the ingredients often so that they melt evenly. The texture should be smooth, and there should be no lumps or clumps.
 Lift the bowl off of the saucepan and set it down onto a stable, heat-resistant surface. For extra flavor, stir in 3 to 5 drops of your favorite extract. For extra color, stir in some loose eyeshadow or powdered blush.









You can also use some powdered drink mix to give you both color and flavor.
 You can use an empty lip balm container or even a clean contact lens case. You can also use small containers meant for storing excess paint; you can find them in the painting section of an arts and crafts store.
 If you are in a hurry, put it in the fridge for a few hours. As it cools, it will become solid again. You can apply it with your finger or a q-tip.
