 They should be about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) wide and 20 centimeter (7.9 in) long.;
, Wash and condition your hair, then comb it through while it is still damp so there is no tangles.
 Do this by twisting the top half of your hair into a looped topknot. Secure this with your hairband.
 It should be few centimeters thick. Comb through it again.
 Fold it in half around the bottom of the section of hair.
 (Try to wrap the hair around the strip very tight - the tighter it is wrapped, the bouncier your hair will be.) Once it reaches your head, tie the two ends in a knot.
, Comb it through. Separate small sections of hair (a couple of cm wide) and repeat Step 5 and Step 6 until the top part is all in rolls, too.
 For best results, leave it rolled up overnight. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it is definitely worth it. If you really just cannot bear this, dry it with your hairdryer (on its coolest setting).
 To do this, undo each knot in the strips, and VERY CAREFULLY roll down your hair from it.
 (Avoid running your fingers through the curls at this stage, as they are much more easy to manage when they are still in their strips.)

, Then you can use them again.
 Remember, gently does it!

, You should now have a head full of gorgeous wavy hair.
