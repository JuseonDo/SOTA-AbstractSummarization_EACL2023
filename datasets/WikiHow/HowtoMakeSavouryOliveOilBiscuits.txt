 Spray the cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Alternatively, line it with parchment paper.;
,, Mix.
 Mix in the olive oil.
 Add the melted butter to the batter. Mix well.
 Place the biscuit dough onto the cutting board. Roll over the dough to flatten it just a little.
 Flatten the ball with a rolling pin. It should be about as thick as your palm.
 A round shape is ideal. You can use a glass end if you don't have a biscuit cutter.
 Repeat cutting and adding biscuits until there is no more biscuit dough left.
 Set a timer for 11 to 15 minutes. The biscuits are ready when they just start to turn golden brown.
 Let cool for 2-3 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
 If storing, keep in an airtight container.
