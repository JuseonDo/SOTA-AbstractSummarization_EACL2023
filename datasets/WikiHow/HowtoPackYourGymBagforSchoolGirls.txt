 Make sure you like it, because you're probably going to be stuck with it for a while. Also, pick a bag that you won't be embarrassed to be seen with. Would you rather have a plastic bag or a nice gym bag? Think about that.;
, Those usually are things such as: a t-shirt, shorts, deodorant, hair ties, etc.
 Drinking out of your own water bottle is better than drinking from a water fountain or somebody else's water bottle.
 You wouldn't want to be itchy and uncomfortable during gym class. This means that you should not pack itchy knitted clothing, etc.
 If they're not, you could get seriously injured. They have to be not too big and not too small for you.Also bring extra socks in case of emergencies.
