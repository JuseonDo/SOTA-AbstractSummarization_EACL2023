 There are eight 6 volt batteries under the turret floor. These power the engine starting motor and the tank electrical system.
 The tank has a dual turbocharged diesel engine that powers it. Check the engine oil, hydraulic fluids, and transmission lubricant levels before cranking the tank., You may need special permits, roadway or pavement protection padding, and traffic control personnel to help with the move.,

Throttle, which is used to increase or decrease engine speed.
Transmission selector to choose the gear the tank will be driven in.
Steering Wheel, connects the engine transmission to left or right track for turning.
Manual brake pedals, to stop the tank and/or assist with sharper turning.

Switch on the primary power control switch.
Push the starter button to engage the starter motor.
If the engine hasn't been cranked for a period of time, you may need to prime the injectors manually or use an ether based starting fluid added to the air intake to start the engine.
 The M60 engines will sometimes speed up on their own., The turret is controlled from the center compartment, not by the tank driver, so if no one is in the gunner's seat, you will need to rotate the turret before entering the front compartment., The transmission requires a lot of engine speed to start the tank in motion. The tank will lurch forward and will require about six to ten feet to stop. Once in motion it will drive something like a car., The drivers hatch cover slides to your right to open. Continue pushing the hatch until it locks in place. The hatch will slide back in a left tilt or a right turn if not locked in place.,

You will notice a big difference between turns in the two gears.â€“ The turning radius is about four times smaller in first gear than it is in second gear.
Lurching and stop and go moves are somewhat normal and doesn't mean you're a bad driver.
