 You can't continue without confronting him, so you won't miss him.;
, He will tell you to pick it up and put it in the nearby trashcan; you can pick up the soda can by aiming at it with your crosshairs and pressing X on your Xbox 360 controller.
 To throw the can, make sure you are still holding it before aiming your crosshairs at the soldier and pressing the Right Trigger. Make sure you aim precisely, as you will not get the achievement if you do not hit the soldier with the soda can.
 You can't die yet, so his attacks won't hurt you. Relish this small victory for the free peoples of Earth.
 It is represented by the Combine soldier's head with a soda can bouncing off it.
