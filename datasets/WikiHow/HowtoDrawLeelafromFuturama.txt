 Sketch a circle and under that, draw a square. Draw guidelines for facial features.;
, Don't forget her eyelashes, and sketch in a cute nose and lips with lipstick. Add in a half-circle for her ear.
 He ponytail is long and fairly shaggy; same with her bangs. Make it look as though they could be covering another eye (although of course they're not).
 Draw three circles: two large ones with a smaller one in the middle. Draw two circles for her chest.
 Draw two ovals for each, then draw her hand on her hip, as shown. Sketch in a bracelet on her right arm.
 Draw a set of two ovals for the legs and add an oval for the feet. Amy and Leela, the ladies of Futurama, have curvier features than the guys--take that into account while drawing them.
 These include her top, pants, and shoes. Make her outfit look so streamlined that it could be a jumpsuit, ending in hardcore boots.
 Make sure no excess guidelines remain.
