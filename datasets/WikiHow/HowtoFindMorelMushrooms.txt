 Morels often grow along the root systems of certain species of trees. Experienced morel hunters look for these trees, and search a pattern from one likely tree to the next. An elm tree that has just died in the last few years is one of the surest bets. Also look for soft maples, poplars, and locust trees. They may potentially be growing all types of trees, so don't ignore other species.;
, Forests that burned in previous years, and old apple orchards can be good places to search. Look for them growing in grass in pastures that are bordered by woods. You might be surprised and and even find them growing in your yard in town!
