 You will be using the donor's ears to replace the ear on your broken Furby.;
, Be sure to remove the outer shell too!

, Locate the base of the endoskeleton ears. Just simply follow the ear down to its gear like base. You will notice that there is a red cover over both of the bases. That needs to be unscrewed.
 Keep the screws in safe place like a cup or dish for later.
 The base of the ear should now be exposed. Just beÂ sure to move the cluster of wires to the side so that you don't compress them.
 There will be a peg that went through the hole in the middle of the base. That is where your new ear will go.
 Now you have the ear that will be going into your working Furby.
 Just put the new ear onto the peg that held the old ear! Simple!

, Be sure to screw it in!

, If it doesn't, then the Furby's ear mechanism may be damaged and not work.
 And now he has two working ears!
