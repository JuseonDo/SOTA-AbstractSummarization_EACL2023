be aware that air-drying techniques only work in dry climates.

 Chilies that are chosen for drying should be completely mature and of full color. Do not use any chilies that have cuts, spots, or blemishes.
 Attempting to naturally air-dry in a humid climate can result in very moldy and soft produce.
