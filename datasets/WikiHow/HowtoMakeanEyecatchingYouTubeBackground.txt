Try to use images that reference things you have done in your videos. If you have no videos, why are you making a background in the first place?
Unless you are handy with a mouse, you probably won't draw well with one. If you have a drawing tablet, use with that instead.
Adjust the template size. Try to make it fit small screens. You may have a 1080p HD screen, but what about other people? what if everyone else doesn't have a super giant screen? Think of laptops. You don't want your background so big that the background only has an arm and a leg on smaller screens. Make your art close to the info box.
 Log in, go to your channel, find the "Channel Settings" button, and upload your newly created background. Choose scrolling, and choose "No Repeat"
