,,, If you are trying to find a point that is lower than the other points around it, press min, if you are trying to find a point that is higher than the other points around it, press max.
 This is the point you are trying to find. Your calculator will ask for the left bound that means the part of the graph to the left of the vertex, even if the cursor is on the other side of the graph it will still work. You can use the left and right arrows to move along the graph.
