 Doing this will keep the juices from leaking out of the turkey into the water, and it will also keep the turkey from absorbing water and swelling.

An alternative is to use a bucket, cover plastic wrapped turkey with water and add a few ice cubes to keep water cold. Add more when the first ones melt. Putting bucket in deep sink (like a laundry sink) or bathtub makes it easy to dump out the water and carry turkey to the oven.
 For example, a turkey weighing between 4 and 12 pounds (2 and 6 kg) will defrost in 2 to 6 hours.
