,, Try to wrap up the whole soap.


If the kids are doing it, resist the urge to step in and do it right for them. Keep your hands off and let them do it, offering a few tips if necessary. The kids might not do it perfectly. The wool wrap might be a little loose. You might end up with a few thin spots in the wool felt. Remember, it will be their soap, their project, and their feeling of accomplishment. You'll be surprised at how great they turn out (the soap and the kids.)

, You can hold the stocking open while the child puts it in.
, You can take the soap long enough to show them how to flip the soap around in their hands, but otherwise, keep your adult hands off. This will take awhile. Encourage them and keep them rubbing and rubbing and rubbing, using more and more consistent hand pressure. This is really good for them and the messy suds are fun.
,,, Thin spots or unevenly felted spots. They're beautiful just as they are. These are like nice little scrubbing mitts. When the soap is all gone and fully rinsed out, you can then use the leftover felt to make a pouch, or in some other project.
