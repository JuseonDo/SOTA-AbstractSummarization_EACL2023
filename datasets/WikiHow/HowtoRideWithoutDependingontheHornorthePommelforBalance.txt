@summary
find out what you are holding onto and why.

@summary
explain to your riding instructor why you feel insecure and why you prefer to hold the pommel or the horn.

@summary
learn that when you feel insecure, hold the cloth a little more until you feel confident.

@summary
try holding the cloth with only your little finger, this allows better control and allows you to simply release your little finger without thinking and grabbing hold again.

@summary
understand that when riding in a competition, you will need to understand that you will be disqualified for touching your saddle, so this will encourage you to let go.

@summary
ride by trotting and you will want to grab hold of the saddle again.

@summary
know that at canter or lope, you will want to hold on to the horn or pommel again, repeat the breathing exercises and gradually take your hand from the saddle to the mane.
@article
 Are you holding onto the pommel to stop your self from bouncing, or the horn to keep you from falling off?;
, They can help you conquer your fears, If you're holding onto the pommel of an English saddle, the process to let go is a little easier. First hold the saddle cloth rather than the saddle, this puts your whole body into a better position, you hand will be at a level that allows for better control.
 Each few days, gradually try to loosen your grip and have less fingers holding the cloth.
 Once you have let go completely, you can ride without a hand support. If you feel insecure, hold onto the mane this way you can still have maximum control, If holding on to the horn of a saddle (Western saddle) it takes a little more effort from the rider. Make sure you have already done steps 1 and 2 at the top of this page.
 But if your simply riding a western horse for pleasure, it will take a little more. To begin with, try to ride one handed, you may find that it is a little difficult if you're a novice or a beginner. If it is harder, try two hands at a walk. This will be easier to steer and stop.
 Try to refrain from doing so and instead sing a song. Think about what you want to do and how your going to do it. Look straight through the horses ears and breath 5 big breaths in and out.# After the 5th breath, stop and adjust yourself. Then do it again, this time take in 7 really big breaths hold for 2 seconds and breath out, repeat 7 times. After a while you will become more relaxed and be thinking of your breathing rather than holding on.
 And then finally from the mane to simply holding the reins.
