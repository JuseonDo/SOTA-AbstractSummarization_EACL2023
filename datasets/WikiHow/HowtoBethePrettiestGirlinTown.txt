 You do not have to make friends with everyone you see, but reflect goodness in general no matter what. Be a loving and caring girl. Beauty begins from the inside.;
, Confidence is the second crucial thing. It makes you all the prettier to others if you like yourself already. If you are not confident yet, then "fake it till you make it." Never be overly cocky. Be confident yet sweet. After doing the next steps regularly you should build confidence.
 Own your own personality even if it is different. That makes you fascinating. But do incorporate the first two steps into your own personality.
, Getting your beauty sleep helps a lot. People do not think of this as much anymore. Do not stay up late browsing the Internet. A well rested girl has nicer skin especially under the eyes. You will need less makeup. A well rested girl is also a nicer one. Get at least 9 hours a night. On busy weekends take a quick nap between activities to refresh and recharge. All the girls on Gone With The Wind did it.
 This in turn hydrates your skin and makes it more beautiful.
 Obviously this helps your weight but many dark veggies help the skin. Also getting a lot of protein grows your hair and nails. Stay away from processed food. Eat whole foods. The modern world and its cheap quick processed food is making us less attractive and healthy. Research nutrition and what foods are good for what.
 You do not have to be model thin because it's not hot anyway. Just keep in mind your hip to waist ratio. It's one of the first things men are programmed to notice. It's all about the curves of the body, not how small the whole body is. Eating whole foods and not much sugar will help. Also find an exercise that makes your waist smaller first. Wear high waisted skirts and slim dresses sometimes. When you wear jeans make sure they are not giving you a muffin top. If you have a belly and you wear jeans make sure you top is fitted but long so you can scrunch it over the tummy.
 They don't have to be big to be nice ones.
 Check them everyday to see if you need to pluck some new little guys. Nice eyebrows make everything else look better. Work with you natural arch and don't to make them too thin. An unnatural eyebrow job is so unflattering.
 Being soft is gorgeous and it gets noticed. Put it on right away after your shower because you'll absorb more moisture. St. Ives Naturally Soothing Oatmeal and Shea Butter is awesome. But also wear sunscreen when your going to be outside all day. You may think tans are attractive now but they will make you wrinkle faster besides the threat of skin cancer.
 Go to the dermatologist and get a prescription. If you can't afford it then get something over the counter. Sulfuric acid or Benzoyl peroxide are the ingredients you're looking for in the highest quantity possible in the grocery store. People have different types of acne so experiment with trying one of these ingredients at a time, one should work for you. Also there are many cheap home remedies you can search for on the Internet to try.
 Shower everyday. Brush teeth twice or three times a day. Always have clean soft hair. Try out different up hair styles to use on the days you do not shampoo. Variety in hair is cute. Guys like it and girls compliment it.
 Body splash is your friend.
 But do not wear the crazy make up everyday especially around the guy you like because many men like a natural look. You can always wear a subtle amount of blush and concealer under your eyes and curl your eyelashes to look more awake. Cover blemishes with mineral based make up or make up or medicated make up. There is really no point to caking the foundation all over your face. Show off your adorable freckles. Keep your lips moist with chap stick every day even if you don't wear lipstick or gloss that day.
 If you straighten your hair use something to protect it. It's wonderful to do new looks but let your hair be natural a couple days of the week. It is prettiest natural,no matter how much you want to fight that. It will be healthier, stronger, and grow faster that way too. Use sulfate free products. If you want to curl your hair try doing it in a heat/damage free way like doing old fashioned pin curls. Deep condition hair once a week. Buy something or whip up something at home.
 Pulling off something that stands out will boost your confidence and get you noticed. But make sure it looks good and is flattering so you are noticed in the right way. It is okay to look simple sometimes too. Nothing is sexier then a plain white or black v-neck or tank top, or a simple sexy dress. You do not have to show skin to be sexy but if you do want to show some then just pick one feature and mostly cover up of the rest.
 Nails are so noticeable.
, Look like you are having a good time as much as possible and laugh a lot. This makes people gravitate to you. Keep your teeth white! Use white strips or just brush with baking soda.
 Do not take it seriously and then nobody will think anything bad about what you just did.
 But don't show off too much or be cocky.
 You want to know what most of the words in the ingredient list are.
 It's so refreshing, hydrating, and healthy. It wakes you up and makes you feel beautiful.
