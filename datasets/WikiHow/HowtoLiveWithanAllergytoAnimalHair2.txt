 Again, if your allergies make this difficult, this job is best done by someone else.


Take your dog outside in good weather or into the bathroom. Cats should be groomed in the bathroom. Close the door securely behind you.
Brush your pet thoroughly, including under the belly and chest, around the neck and face, and under the tail and back of legs. Remove the hair from the brush regularly and put it into a closed plastic bag.
Use a towel lightly dampened with water to wipe down the animal's fur after you are done brushing her.
Close the plastic bag with the hair in it securely and dispose of it, then wipe down all of the surfaces in the bathroom.
