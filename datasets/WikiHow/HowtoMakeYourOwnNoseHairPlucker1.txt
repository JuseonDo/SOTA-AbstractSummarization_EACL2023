 The little extension spring with the diameter of a drinking straw is the most important part, which is why you should be the most meticulous when choosing one.


It should be stainless steel, with smooth round coils, that fit tightly together in its relaxed state. It should not be a weak spring. It should be kind of tough, so you might want to try a few different kinds to see what suits your own quality and taste.

You may need to use more than one form of pliers to do this.






If you screw it up just cut the end off and try again till you get it right. It might take a few times for practice.
,, Filing the nail will take a little bit of time.


You may want to use a grinder to help speed the project along.
 The nail should be about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) longer than the spring.


Pushing will open the spring's coils just a little bit. It shouldn't take much pressure, pushing on the nail, to do this. The spring's coils should not open more than a millimeter (about the thickness of 4 sheets of printer paper).
 Take your time.


The tape need NOT be very tight. Wrap a bit more of the tape around the end of the spring near the plunger (nail-head).






This will provide a holding spot for your fingers while your thumb can push on the plunger. :







,, You may keep it in your pocket, but it is recommended to use a little pouch or container to keep the parts together, as well as for sanitary purposes.


The nail will easily fall out of the spring as it is, within this set of instructions. :

, Either way, now you can have a healthier nose with cleaner nostrils, the way you had when you were young. :
