@summary
cut the mantle into rings by slicing vertical to the line of the squid's back.

@summary

@article
 You will see the head, where the eyes and tentacles are, is distinctly separate from the body, or mantle .;
, These are not necessary for safely handling squid, but will keep squid residue from getting on your hands and imparting a "fishy" smell.
 Pull gently and steadily forward, keeping a firm grasp on the head. The internal organs should slide out.
 Feel for a hard, fingernail like sheathing; grab this and pull it out.
 The speckles on the squid should peel off in a cellophane-like sheet, leaving behind slick white meat.
 Set aside.
