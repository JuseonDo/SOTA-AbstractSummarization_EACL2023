work the reflex point for your diaphragm, which are located on both feet just below the lung area.

@summary
pay special attention to the reflex point for your pineal gland, which is located in the center of your big toe on each foot.
@article
 Use your thumb to edge along this reflex point from one side of your foot to the other. Start on the outer edge of your foot and creep along using steady pressure until you get to the inner edge of your foot, then go back in the other direction. Repeat up to five times on each foot.
 Your pineal gland plays an important role in the adjustment of your biorhythms. Balancing this area, which also includes the reflex for your pituitary gland, calms down any over-activity in your brain and helps you get a good nightâ€™s rest.
