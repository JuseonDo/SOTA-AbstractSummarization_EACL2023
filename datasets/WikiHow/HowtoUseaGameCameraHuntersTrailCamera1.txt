decide on how the camera will be set up, regarding timing as a new photo can, perhaps, be taken each/every 30 seconds for as long as the motion (or sensing heat) events are detected.

 Lock the included strap to lessen loss of camera, discourage theft.


It is a rugged and weatherproof camera designed for extended outdoor use.
Take pictures each "time-stamped" (with the date and time it was recorded).
 It is sold for hunters for instance to record and view deer, moose or bear, etc. that have been in a clearing, pasture or on an animal/game trail.


Use these unmanned cameras activated by motion to learn where game is located -- useful for "preseason scouting", finding good hunting locations, based on images on camera. Record images, either as a still photograph or a video.
,,


Take pictures of the same moment/place, as desired.



Digital pictures instead of film, or
Film to get developed, usually 35mm -- instead of digital memory,
Laser aim uses a red light beam to focus at a location to take the image,
Strobe flash (incandescent flash) that will reach out to 15 feet (4.6 m) for nighttime images.
, Some game cameras give choices of settings for regular flash or stealthy LED (IR) flash.


LED (Infrared) flash allows you to image game at night without visible flash. So, flash does not give away the camera position to others observing the different hunting areas. Some models have a manual switch to set an infrared imaging (filter) to day or night mode.
