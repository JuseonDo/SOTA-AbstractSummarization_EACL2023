 This will help you to personalize thank you notes.


Some shower hosts distribute blank envelopes to guests and ask that they write their names and addresses on them. This way the new mom can mail thank you notes without needing to look up and print addresses. Some circles consider it improper etiquette to collect addresses in this manner, and other circles use the envelopes to draw for door prizes at the shower. Discuss your opinions on this practice with your shower hosts prior to the start of the celebration.;
, Your stationery may or may not match your shower invites.
 If you receive a gift that multiple people chipped in to purchase use "Dear Friends."


Shower invitees are usually close friends and family, so first names are appropriate. In the rare case that a business associate, or someone you do not know well, attends you can use Mrs./Miss/Ms. with her last name.



For example, write "What a perfect gift from an amazing friend! I can't wait to get the new bedding set into the crib."

For example, you may write "Thank you for traveling into town to attend my shower. I was thrilled to see you!"
