Car construction of the Fiat takes place all over the world, so a global search for the perfect vehicle for you is not out of the question. Fiats have been built in factories in places like Brazil, Argentina and Poland, and they have joint ventures in places like Italy, India, France, Pakistan, Turkey, China and more.
Their oldest vehicle was the 3 1/2 CV, and there were only 8 copies made of the vehicle.
Many models of Fiat have won European Car of the Year, including the Fiat 124, Fiat 128, Fiat 127 and the Lancia Delta.
The Fiat 500 is a popular model. They were designed by Dante Giacosa, and they were available from 1957 to 1975.;

Use the newspaper classified section as a starting point. Search both the personal classifieds as well as the car dealership ads.
Hop to the internet and look through the inventory of the local car dealerships. While most put their newest vehicles on their print ad, generally their entire stock is featured online.
 These magazines can generally be found at convenience stores or gas stations in racks by the door.

, Start with a fair price as determined by what you found in the Kelley Blue Book, and don't be afraid to negotiate.
 Iron out if the seller will have it shipped, will deliver it to you, if you will have someone drive you to pick it up, or if you will fly or take other mass transit to its location to drive it home.
