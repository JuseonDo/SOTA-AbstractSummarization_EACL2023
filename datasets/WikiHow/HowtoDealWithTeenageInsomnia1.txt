 If possible, cut out caffeine as much as possible, like drinking de-caf tea.;
, Have your evening meal at least three hours before bed and have supper if you are hungry.
 This means your body expects to sleep when it is dark.
 This brings bad associations with the bedroom and the idea of spending time in there.
, You have to retrain your body when you get into the habit of staying up late so this must be kept up.
, Try to wean this down over time.
 This gives your body a chance to relax and wind down before sleep.
 Experts will say that if you have woken and are awake after 20 minutes, you should walk abouthowever this means you will watch the clock and expect that you will have to get up. Turn your alarm clock to the wall or cover it, especially if it glows.
 This may seem odd, but as long as from the second you put your head on the pillow to sleep you think about something outside of your own life, you will become less aware of your surroundings and gradually fall asleep.
 Technically, teenagers should naturally wake up at 10am and go to bed at around 1am (to get the nine hours) however most of society does not cater for this so it means getting up at around seven every day.
