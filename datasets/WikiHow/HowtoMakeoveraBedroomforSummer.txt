 Whether you're painting the whole room or just adding new decorations, be sure to use bright colors to match the brightness of summer. Some suggestions are orange, aquamarine, and lime.;
, Match these with the room colors. Though, make sure it is not too heavy, it is summer after all. You probably don't want a heatstroke!

, Choose lamps that have lovely shades, again fitting in with the room colors.
 Or use a portable fan if you can't add a new one to the ceiling.
 Find curtains that can block out heavy sunlight in the middle of the day but diffuse the light during other times of the day. A good combination is net curtains with heavier drapes over the top.
 These can create an instant new look in your room.
 Add a new bookshelf, perhaps a desk, or a chair.
 Add a few books sitting casually by the end table, or decorate a pencil pouch. Make your room look lived in. (Though don't clutter everything up!)
