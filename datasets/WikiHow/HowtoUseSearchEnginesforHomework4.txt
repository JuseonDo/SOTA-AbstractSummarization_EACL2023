 Try to work systematically through your research questions, instead of hopping back and forth.
 In order to downsize the information you have gathered into a manageable size, you will need to take the portions that answer your question and place them on a document next to the research questions.
 Although you will use the information you have gathered to study and answer questions in your own words, you may be asked to cite your research.
 Ask your teacher whether it should be in MLA or AP style, since it will change how you refer to the websites.


Good resources for bibliographies are easybib.com/reference/guide/mla/website and mesacc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=38266&sid=281078.

 Save your research and bibliography on your computer, if possible.
