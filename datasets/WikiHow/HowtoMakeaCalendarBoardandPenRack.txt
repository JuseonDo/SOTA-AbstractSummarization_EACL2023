, Where you have a piece like the upright of the calendar-board to mark out, with opposite sides alike, it is best to draw a center-line first, then lay off the measurements each side of this line, and connect the points with straight lines. Alternately, lay off the measurements on one side of the center-line, draw the lines connecting the points, make a careful tracing of the outline, reverse the tracing, and trace it off upon the opposite side of the center-line., The round corners of the upright piece of the calendar-board can either be cut with a chisel or be filed round. The bevel on the top edge of the base block can be made with a plane or chisel.,,, This used to be a standard size that can be purchased at stationery stores when this article was written initially. If you don't find such a calendar easily, you can print a calendar pad of your own using the computer to create one. The brass screw-hooks which screw into the front edge of the base block, to form the pen-rack, should be 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) long., This will prevent the base from scratching surfaces it sits on, and will give the gift a finished, professional feel.
