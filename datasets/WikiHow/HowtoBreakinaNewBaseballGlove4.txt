 This method is equivalent to breaking in a new glove for six months.
 Cover the entire surface of the glove. Coat the back of the glove as well. Let the material soak up the lather for several minutes.
 Put the foamed glove on a cloth-covered baking sheet. Set it on the top rack of the oven. Set a kitchen timer to make sure you don't leave the glove in too long or forget to take it out.
 Allow it to cool. Wipe away any residue from the treatment.
 Insert a baseball or softball into the glove's sweet spot where you are most likely to catch the ball. Allow the glove to cool around the ball.



Note: Most glove manufacturers recommend against using chemicals or heat to break in gloves. In other words, take the above steps in moderation. Too much heat or chemical treatment can ruin the flexibility and comfort inherent in leather.
