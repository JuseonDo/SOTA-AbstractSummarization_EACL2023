find some strong thread.

@summary
snip about 20 inches (51Â cm) (a foot and a half) of thread.

@summary
tie the two ends of the thread together.

@summary
now hold the thread with both hands, and wind it around ten times.

@summary
place the thread around the fingers of both hands.

@summary
practice the above motions until you feel fairly comfortable with the movements of your hands.

@summary
once you are comfortable, its time to start practicing on real hair!,

@summary
sitting on your bed or on a chair, prop up one leg and identify the portion from which you want to remove hair.

@summary
,

@summary
place the thread on this portion.

@summary
now, move the wound portion to the other side, making sure that it catches the hair while moving.

@summary
be patient.

@summary
once you are comfortable, move onto your upper lip or other parts of your face that need to be threaded.

@summary
avoid doing this on your eyebrows unless you are absolutely confident in your abilities.

 You do not need a special type of thread. Use white thread because its easier to see the hair you thread out.;
, This does not need to be exact. You can experiment with different lengths as you become more comfortable with the technique.
 A simple knot will suffice as long as the ends don't come apart (here's a quick one- remember the first knot you make when tying your shoelaces? just make that about 2-3 times with the two ends of the thread).
 The wound bit now lies in the center of the circle.
 Push the wound portion towards one hand by widening the fingers of one hand and simultaneously closing the fingers of the other hand (if you're doing this right, your hands will appear to be having a respectful, mock "conversation" with each other. When one hand "talks" the other will be quiet and vice versa).
 Usually, a smaller length of thread is easier to work with when you are still practicing your hand movements.
 My suggestion would be to practice on your leg since most people have hair on their legs that can be seen/reached easily.
, Let the wound part be one end of the hair, and the thread from the other side should be on both sides of the hair you want to remove.
 It will then lift the hair from the root as it moves back and forth.
 This will require lots of practice!

,, Remember, your eyebrows are less forgiving of errors than any other parts of your body.
