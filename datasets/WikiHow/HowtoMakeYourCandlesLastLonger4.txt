you can actually make a candle that has salt in it.
@article
 Get a metal spoon, table salt, and a candle.
 Wait until the candle starts to melt and you have some melted wax. You will need a fair amount.
 Mix it in good, use the metal spoon and try to do it before the candle hardens again. Do not mix in to much salt.
 This is probably the best method as the whole candle has the salt in it.
