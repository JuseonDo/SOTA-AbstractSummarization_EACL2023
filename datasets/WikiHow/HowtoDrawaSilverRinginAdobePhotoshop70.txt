 It would be ideal that your picture is a square. For this example, we set the size to 800x800 pixels. Set the resolution to 72 pixels per inch, and under "Contents", select "White".;
, Open the drop - down menu by clicking on the arrow icon to the right of the displayed shape and size of the brush. Click the arrow in the top right corner of the menu and select "Load Brushes". Choose "Assorted Brushes" and click "Load".
 Increase its master diameter according to the image size. Here the diameter of the brush will be 700 pixels. Set brush Opacity and Flow to 100%. Set black as your foreground color and white as your background color (this is the default color setting in PS7).
 Position your brush and click 5 times to create a thick, black circle.
 Click once. The white will over - paint the black and give the impression of gray. Click again to make it brighter - this is the silver look we're going for.
 Use the Eraser Tool (shortcut "E") to get rid of them. Make sure to leave some of the gray around the ring, to give it that "shaded" look.
 If you wish, use the various Photoshop tools - brush, gradient, clone stamp, pattern stamp etc. - to add jewels, texture and / or insignia to your ring.
