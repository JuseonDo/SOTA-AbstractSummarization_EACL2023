 Keeping them busy talking about something and joking doesn't permit them to feel bored. Switch on the TV and put some funny channels or any movie or anything worth watching and spending your time with them.

They may not have visited you for any particular reason and therefore be perfectly happy to watch TV. They may have travelled several house to visit you so be careful not to offend by preferring to watch TV than make your guests welcome and have polite, conversation about what is going on in your life












, Get games like Twister, specifically, it's an ideal game for when you are arranging tour house if visitors are coming, or must have something to had that keeps them busy and is fun.
