 Slice the meat, clean the shrimp, or dice the tofu. This takes the longest to cook. Judge the time it takes to cook by the time it would take the vegetables to cook or finish cooking.


If you're using shrimp, you want to start off by cleaning them and taking the tails off. Don't pre-cook them unless the other elements will be done very quickly.
 Boil the water and prepare the noodles as normal. When done, add a small amount of olive oil to keep from sticking and toss.
 Steam or saut√© the veggies until they are almost done.
 Cook until hot.
 It's leftovers, so it should be pre-cooked. Place into a skillet and heat with a small amount of water or light oil.;
, Drain and put into a bowl with a small amount of olive oil to keep from sticking and toss. When the meat is warmed, add in to the skillet.
 When the vegetables are almost done, add to the cooked meat.
