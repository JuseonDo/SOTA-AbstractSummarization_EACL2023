 These are the simple ways to check that your car has no problem.;
, We all think we're great drivers, and some of us are, but there are other people on the road too. Remember not to stare at anything for too long. Be aware of your surroundings and make sure you are aware of what's happening on every side of your car. Constantly check your rear-view mirror and try to judge every cars speed. Knowing where everyone is and how they drive will help you decide who to stay away from and where to go when the time calls for it.
 There are side-streets and parking areas where people can just pull out without noticing. Checking your blind spots before you move in the next lane always helps avoids side-swiping accidents.
 Pull ahead of them or behind for a brief moment to show them that you are still there, just in case they don't check their blind spots.
 Not everyone pays attention!

, Remember that emergency vehicles sometimes have to drive through red lights or against the normal direction of traffic!

, When you use the signal lights, you are also warning everyone that you want to change your lanes. They may slow down or stop the car until you pass the road.
 Most people have accidents because they don't follow the laws. The laws may not align with your idea of how to drive, but they are there to keep you and the people around you safe.
 When you push the brake, it takes a few seconds to stop the car because of the time it takes to think, react and push the brake. The safe distance depends on the speed. When you push the brake, you also can slide a little distance, so we must keep a safe distance. Remember, more speed/more distance.
, You never know what is going to come from the other side.
