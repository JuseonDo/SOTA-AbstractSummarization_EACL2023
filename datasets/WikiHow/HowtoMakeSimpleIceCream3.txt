 The more ripe the bananas are, the better your ice cream will turn out.
 You want the banana chunks to be about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If they are too big, they may clog up your food processor.
 Do not over-blend your ice cream, or it will start to melt.
 At this point, your ice cream is ready to eat, but you can take it a step further by adding some goodies, such as chocolate chips. Here are some yummy ideas to get you started:To make mint-chip ice cream, add a few drops of peppermint extract and a handful of dark chocolate chips.
To make chocolate ice cream, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder.
To make strawberry ice cream, toss in a handful of sliced strawberries and a few drops

, Scoop the ice cream out into small serving bowls using an ice cream scoop. If you aren't going to eat it right away, transfer it into a freezer-safe container and put it into the freezer; it will last for about two days. Keep in mind that because this ice cream is made from bananas, it will turn a light brown after some time.
