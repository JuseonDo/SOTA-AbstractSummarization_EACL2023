,, Leave it to cool.
,, You can adjust the amount, just keep in mind: more honey means you need more liquid and more oatmeal. It should form a paste texture but after few minutes the oatmeal will suck in all the liquid. Too much Vitamin C power can irritate your skin and is more difficult to dissolve into the water, so don't overdo it.
 It's a bit messy so better do it at the sink.
 It's recommended that you leave it at least an hour and up to three hours. It always take times to work. You can test by trying to soften your skin with honey; the longer you leave it on, the better it works.


Put a paper mask on top to avoid the oatmeal dripping all over when it starts to dry up.
Note that this mask won't be dry even if you leave it until morning, because the water is very limited, and honey can't easily be dried up, and the oatmeal keeps the moisture in as well.
