 Why? By meeting Barbara (she's a cop) you will get out of jail for FREE and with all of your weapons anytime as long as she's your girlfriend. She is located in Tierra Robada on El quebrados's' parking. To meet her, just go near her and wait until she talks to you and then answer her positively. A message will show that you got a new girlfriend.;

, If you know where the restricted area is, Fort Carson is the small town just south of the base. Go there and look for a Freeway bike. They are lower than an NRG-500 or a PCJ-600.
 Turn off the road before the corner on the dirt road leading to the base.
 If you keep on the road, you'll go through an open gate. Keep on going into the outdoor area of the base.
 Go towards the vent and put the bike (with CJ still on it) parallel with the vent NOT ON the vent. Get off the bike on top of the vent. You should end up inside the base. If not, then keep trying.

, To do that you have to first spawn a Quadbike:


Xbox: Left, Left, Down, Down, Up, Up, X, B, Y, R Trigger, Black
PS2: Left, Left, Down, Down, Up, Up, Square, Circle, Triangle, R1, R2
PC: AKJJYGLC

,, DO NOT KILL any cops! Remember, you have to get BUSTED! It's your only way out. When you see a cop, get out of the Quadbike and then get in again. You'll see that the cop will run to you and try to arrest you. Just let him do his job and you will get out of Area 69 with ALL of your weapons. If not, try to get closer to the cop; keep trying.
