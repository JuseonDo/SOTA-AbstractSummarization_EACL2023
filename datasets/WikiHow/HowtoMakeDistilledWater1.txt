, Be sure it floats. The bowl should not touch the bottom of the pot.


If the bowl doesn't float, remove it from the water and set a round baking rack on the bottom of the pot. Then place the bowl back in the water

, This water should be hot but should not boil. If the water begins to boil, turn down the heat on the stove.
 You can do this by inverting the pot's lid and filling it with ice. When hot steam hits the cold lid, it will create condensation.
 As the water continues to boil, it will cause steam to rise and condense on the pot's lid. The condensation will drip into the bowl. Allow the distillation process to continue until you have enough distilled water in the bowl for your needs.
, Use caution when doing this so you do not burn yourself. You can allow the water to cool before removing the bowl, if you prefer.
