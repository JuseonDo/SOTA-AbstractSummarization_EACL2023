You could also use a large jacket or a towel to achieve the same effect., Break it up!” along with your pillow-throwing for added effect. With a barrage of pillows raining down on them, both cats will be eager to exit the area.


You should aim for the area around them, but if they don’t heed your presence right away, don’t hesitate to throw pillows at them with moderate force. Take care not to hit either cat in the face.
 If you suspect the other cat will pursue the cat that left the fight, give both cats their favorite toys.
