 Don't worry about the progress you've made in Sims 3. Most will be saved and all not saved can be done again. After all, why even play it if it's not fun to do this stuff?;
, Do not put up any Internet tabs before you go on without closing them. Too many tabs up at a time could make your computer unresponsive.
, Bringing it down and up too much can make it glitch up and freeze.
 Restarting it too much when it freezes could close down some important things like Anti-virus programs and firewalls.
 If you use Internet Explorer, switch to Internet Explorer 9.
