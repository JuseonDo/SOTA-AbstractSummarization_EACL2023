deny that the episode happened.

have no recollection of the event the next morning.your sleepwalking episode will no doubt be the first topic of the morning, so be prepared to look completely confused and claim to have no recollection whatsoever about what transpired.

@summary
act out of sorts the next day.

 Mutter phrases like, “What happened?” and “Where am I?” when you “wake up”.
 You’ll want to appear so disoriented that you're unable to recall the event, so denying that it happened would be a very believable response. Argue defensively a bit with the person that woke you up and claim that you’re certain you didn’t sleepwalk.



When pressed, continue to insist that you don’t remember. This is a very common side effect of sleepwalking and not remembering the episode is very authentic behavior.
 It’s common for sleepwalkers to feel disoriented and have problems functioning after a sleepwalking event all the way into the next day. If you’re going for the long con with your sleepwalking fake out, act edgy and confused the next day. Fumble with items and pretend that you’re having difficulty focusing.
