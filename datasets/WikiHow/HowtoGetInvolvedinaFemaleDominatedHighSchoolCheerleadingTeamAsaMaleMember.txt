 It will take time and you have to practice everyday.;
,, Take this time to ask any questions.


If the cheerleading team at you school is only for girls try to persuade the coach that it would look good if the boys got a chance too.
To help persuade the coach, show him a few moves. It might help.
,, Run, go to the gym and practice jumping. Try to work out everyday.
 Have confidence in yourself, it will help.
, It is not only good for you but it will help your muscles and provide energy.
 You don't see cheerleaders scowling. If you try your hardest then you have nothing to fear, also if you do make a mistake continue and don't let it knock you.
