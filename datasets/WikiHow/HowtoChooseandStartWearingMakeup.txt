@summary
try to figure out what kind of skin tone you have.

@summary
if you have a warm skin tone, you look better in jewel tones, reds, blues, purples etc.

@summary
if you have a cool skin tone, you look better in earthy tones, browns, greens, golds etc.

@summary
once you've figured out your skin tone, try to find makeup in these tones.

@summary
start with something basic, and natural, for example, some mascara, a little eyeliner, and lip gloss.

@summary
once you feel confident pulling off an easy look, try to get more advanced, and buy concealer, setting powder and foundation.

@summary
look up video tutorials of more difficult looks, or figure them out yourself, so that eventually you'll be able to do your own glam looks for parties.

 Look at the veins on your wrist. If they are a greenish tone you have a warm skin tone, if they are blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone. If you have both, your skin could be neutral. Different kinds of colors go with different skin tones.;
, Your foundation should be leaning towards pink, and you look good with pure white and black.
 Your foundation should be leaning towards pink, and you look good in ivory and should not wear too much black.
 Start with more neutral tones, nothing to bright or crazy, because these are harder to get off if you make a mistake. Avoid waterproof things until you are more confident in your makeup applying as these are also very difficult items to get off.
 To apply mascara, brush the wand from root to tip of your lashes, to apply eye liner, gently pull your lid taut, then draw a thin line, as close to your lashes as possible, from the beginning of your lashes until the end.
 It's important that you get an exact match for your skin tone. Apply concealer first, then foundation, then powder. To apply foundation, dab it on your face, a couple dots all over, then with large sweeping motions blend it in. To apply concealer, put a small dot and gently rub it in with your ring finger or a makeup sponge. To apply powder, drag your brush through the powder, then tap the edge on the edge of the powder, getting rid of any extra. Then using sweeping motions, lightly cover your face. Be sure to always blend into your neck for a natural look
