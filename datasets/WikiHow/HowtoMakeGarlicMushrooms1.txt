 Rinse the mushrooms first using cold water, focusing on the undersides. If necessary, trim down the stems. Once the mushrooms are all clean, cut them into thin slices using a sharp knife.;
, If you have a garlic press, you can use that instead.
 Get the oil hot, but not so hot that it starts to smoke.
 Use a spatula to spread them as evenly as possible across the bottom of the pan.
 Stir them often with a spatula so that they get evenly coated with the olive oil and garlic.
 You won't need a lot of salt at this point; you will be seasoning them further with more salt and pepper just before you are ready to serve them.
 Stir them occasionally. The lid will trap the moisture, and keep the mushrooms from burning., This will help evaporate any excess liquid, and keep the mushrooms from becoming too soggy. Remember to stir the mushrooms from time to time with a spatula, so that they don't burn.
 If you'd like some extra flavor, chop up some chives or green onions, and sprinkle them over the mushrooms.
 You can eat the mushrooms on their own, or add them as a side dish to steak, chicken, or any other thing you like.
