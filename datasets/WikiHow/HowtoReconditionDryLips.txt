 Don't forget a small bowl to put the ingredients in, and a spoon to mix them with. You may want a paper towel for later on.;
, Take your spoon, and mix them together until you get a smooth consistency. The petroleum jelly might stick to the spoon a bit, so take your finger and push it off. Then continue to mix.
 Using your finger, dip it in the scrub. Then rub the mixture all over your lips for one to two minutes. Then take a paper towel, and wipe it off.
 Doing it a second time allows the sugar to remove the dry skin on your lips.
 Run a washcloth under warm water, drain it, and lightly run it over your lips if you would like. Just to get off any sugar left on them.
