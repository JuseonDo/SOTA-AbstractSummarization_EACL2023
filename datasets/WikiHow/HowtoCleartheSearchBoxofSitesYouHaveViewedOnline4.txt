 If you don't see a Gear button, press Alt and then click the Tools menu.
 This will open a new window with the Internet Explorer options.
 The "Delete Browsing History" window will appear.
 This option will delete the entries you have typed into forms and search fields on websites.


If you don't want websites that you've visited to appear in the address bar, check the "History" option as well.
 This will delete your selected items.
 When you just need to delete a single entry, you can do it manually without clearing your entire history:


Click the field that contains the entry you want to delete. If there are lots of entries, you may need to type the first few letters to make it appear.
Highlight the entry will your mouse or keyboard keys.
Press â‡§ Shift+Del to delete the highlighted entry.
