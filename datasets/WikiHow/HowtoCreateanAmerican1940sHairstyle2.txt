 This may take some trial and error, so be patient.
 Let it air or blow dry so that it is still damp. It is most useful to put setting lotion into an atomizer because it can be applied more evenly.
 Sections of hair can be from ½ inch to 1½ inch in thickness, depending on how thick your hair is or how it reacts to curling. If you want a certain set, curl in the directions that it will need to go in the final style. If you want just the ends curled, start with the underneath sections of hair and work up.
 Make sure that the strand isn't twisted in any manner that would disrupt the direction of the curl. Once the end is started, it is easier to roll up more.
 For more ringlet styles, remember to keep the curls uniform and make a little donut shape.
, However, these are hard to sleep in and best for use with hairdryers.


Avoid rolling ends too tightly or they will be frizzy. A set can last from one to five days if it is kept up at night in a snood or scarf.
