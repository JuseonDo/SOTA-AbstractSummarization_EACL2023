, If you are looking to pay less, then a used Furby may be best for you. If you are willing to pay a bit more, then you can get a Furby new in box., You can only find Furby Boom, Furbacca, and Furblings in stores. Any other Furby must be obtained online. EBay and Amazon are great places to find Furbys!, But if you are up to the challenge of a repair, consider purchasing one new in box., If you ordered one, track the package so that you will know when your Furby will arrive. If you purchased one from a store, then you can just take it home!,
