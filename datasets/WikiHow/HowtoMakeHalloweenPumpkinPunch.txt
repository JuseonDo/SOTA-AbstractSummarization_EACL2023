 Once hollowed, you can decorate with a black magic marker (make sure that it is not toxic), paper cutouts, or just go "pumpkin naturel" if it's not Halloween.;
, Form little balls from the apple using a melon baller.


Place the apple balls into a bowl.
 Spike each ball through the center with a clove.



Give it a quick stir and heat for a few minutes until warm.






Remove it from the heat. You can let it cool, or you can serve it nice and warm.
 Pour the Halloween Pumpkin punch into the hollowed pumpkin and serve!
