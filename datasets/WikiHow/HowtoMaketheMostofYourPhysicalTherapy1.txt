 Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.;
, Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.
 Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.
