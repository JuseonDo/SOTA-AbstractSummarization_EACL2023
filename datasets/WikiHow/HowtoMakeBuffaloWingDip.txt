 If the chicken is still frozen, then make sure to fully defrost before boiling. (Be sure that you disinfect the sink after chicken is placed into the boiling water).;
,, Cover the pot and allow the chicken to cook until the insides of the chicken breasts are no longer pink. The amount of time that you need to allow it to cook can vary depending on the thickness of the chicken. However, it should take no longer than 25 minutes.
, Use a fork and knife to shred the chicken until you get two full cups of meat, and place the shredded chicken into a large mixing bowl.
, The cream cheese works best if it is at room temperature. If you are in a rush, then you can take the cream cheese out of the foil, place it onto a paper plate, and warm it up for 10 seconds in the microwave. The cream cheese should not be fully melted, but easy enough to mix and place it in the same bowl with the chicken.
 If you would like, blue cheese can be used in place of ranch dressing, to really make the dip "Buffalo style."

, Depending on the spice preference of the people who will be eating this dip, you can add more or less to the mixture.
, Make sure there are no visible signs of clumps.
, After that, serve with various dipping foods such as tortilla chips, carrots, and celery.
 It is best to use the dip 2-5 days after making. When reheating, use a microwave safe plate and reheat for 30-40 seconds.
