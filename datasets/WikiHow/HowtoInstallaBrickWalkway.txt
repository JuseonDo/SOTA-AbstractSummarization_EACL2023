 Some people like straight walkways, while others like to get a little fancier with the design and use different bricks or sizes.;
, Garden hoses are long and flexible, making it easy to make changes.


Make certain the walkway is straight, unless you have the talent necessary to cut the bricks to fit a curved design.
 You'll want to mark each side of the walkway with stakes.


Tie colored string from stake to stake, making straight lines to use as a guide when digging.
 Follow the walkway and dig down into the ground about 8 inches (20.3 cm).


The depth of your walkway must be consistent for the entire walkway.
 This type of shovel works great for digging through tough soil and grass.
 While the walkway needs to be level, the ground should slope gently outward from the brick walkway to act as a runoff route for rain and snow.
 Be certain you evenly spread the gravel over your walkway.
 These stay in the ground and act as permanent support for your bricks. Your bricks should fit within the forms, which are flexible enough to compensate for any curves in your walkway border.
, This works great under your bricks and acts like concrete once you water it and allow it to dry.
 Check your walkway every few feet with a level to be certain you are maintaining the proper height and curve.
 Using a rubber mallet, tamp each brick as you place it.
, Be sure to sweep stone dust along the brick edges with a soft broom.
 The stone dust will become hard over time and hold the bricks in place.
