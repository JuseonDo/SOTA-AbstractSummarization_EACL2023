@article
 Mix together 1/3 cup shea butter with 1/3 cup virgin coconut oil, ¼ cup jojoba or sweet almond oil, 10 drops of rosemary essential oil and 3 to 5 drops of peppermint essential oil.
 Keep a close eye on the pan, as you don’t want the ingredients to bubble or fully cook but instead melt and blend.
 Continue to stir as you remove the pan and turn off heat once the ingredients are almost blended together (but not entirely). Stir until fully mixed.
 Cover with either aluminum foil or plastic wrap to protect the cream from being “infected” by other food odors.


Chill cream until it solidifies. This could take anywhere from three hours to overnight.
 You want this cream whipped up and fluffy so continue whipping until desired consistency has been achieved.
 Use a spoon or rubber spatula to transfer cream to jars. Don’t pack tightly but allow cream to settle naturally in the mason jar. Add lid.
