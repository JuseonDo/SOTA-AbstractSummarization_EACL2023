 It won't help you if you're trying to escape in a minivan.;
, Crashing will be a major setback, and can kill you if you're too reckless.
 Drive across railroads, down beaches, through parks. Chances are, they will attempt to follow you. Stay in the general area, wait for them to slip up, then speed off.
 Officers tend to follow your exact route. If you weave in and out of traffic, around buildings and trees, and make false turns, eventually they will crash.
Â Police make scans of public areas to identify suspects. If you are in a scanning zone (indicated by the yellow circle on your map), duck into an alley and hide in your vehicle.
 If you are being tailed too long, a chopper will show up, and escape becomes unlikely. Try to lose them by going through underpasses, then turning around.
 Once police lose sight of you, they will begin combing the area of your last sighting to find you.
 Quickly leave the area before a blockade is set up.
