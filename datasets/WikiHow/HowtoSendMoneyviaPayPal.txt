Confirm that you have the email address or phone number correct before sending money so you don't accidentally send it to the wrong person.
Click on the field instead of typing the information if you have sent money to this person in the past. A scroll-down list will appear that shows everyone you have recently sent money to.
 As of 2010, PayPal does business in over 150 countries and offers 16 currency choices.

Read through the payment information, making sure there are no errors in the payment amount and payee information.
If the balance of your PayPal account is great enough to cover the payment, the money will automatically come out of your PayPal account.



Click "Change" on the payment review page where PayPal lists your funding source if you wish to send the money from different source. The site will then direct you to choose the credit or debit card, or other linked account, where PayPal can withdraw money.
