Look for a beat up cooler at a thrift store or garage sale. As long as it seals at the top, paint can cover other superficial damages.
Buy a cooler at a box store, such as Walmart or Target. Plastic coolers range from $20 to $100.;
, The more flat surfaces, the better, since you will be able to apply paint directly.


A cooler with a flat surface is better than a cooler with a ribbed surface.
 If you have dents or an indented logo, you will want to follow this step.
 This paste is available at most home improvement stores, just like primer and other painting tools.
 Wait approximately 12 hours for it to dry.
 Sand all the surfaces that you plan to paint.
, Then, wash it with a mild soap. Rinse well and allow it to dry.
, You will want to do all of the priming and painting outdoors.


For best results, try a primer especially made for uneven plastic surfaces. Look for Rustoleum Fusion for Plastic or a similar product. The spray paint allows for easy and fast application.
 Apply 2 coats, if recommended by the manufacturer.
 You can print out stencils and logos.
 Copy the design over to the tracing paper if you have printed out designs.
 You can also draw freehand onto the cooler with a pencil, and use the lines to guide your painting.
 You can also buy a bulk paint, like Gesso, and mix your own colors.
 Outlines and small illustrations are much easier with these pens.
 Take your time to ensure you fill out the design completely.


Use blue painter's tape to form straight lines. Put the paint onto the primed surface. Then, take it off afterward and paint the outline of the tape.
 Do not tilt the cooler onto painted sides, while the paint is still curing.
, Make sure you apply an even coat.
 Apply 1 to 2 more coats.


The care you take with sealing your painted cooler will determine how long the paint job lasts.
