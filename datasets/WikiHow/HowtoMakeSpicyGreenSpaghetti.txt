, You may wish to do this over a garbage can or sink so you can immediately dispose of the peelings. Slice the peppers open and take all the seeds and veins out, and dispose of them.
 Pour one cup of half-and-half into the blender. Puree the mixture of peppers and half-and-half. Puree the mixture until there are no large chunks of pepper.
 Add 3 teaspoons of salt and a splash of olive oil to the water. Allow the mixture to come to a boil. For each person eating, add five ounces of angel hair noodles to the boiling pot. Turn the heat down to medium-high and allow to boil for 5 minutes.
