 There are Five Parts to the witch's hat diagram: The exposition, the rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.;
, Thinking of the plot as you go along is perfectly fine, but you *will* have to do some editing later on.
 This diagram gives you a visual aid to the basic outline of your story. First, you will need to draw an up-side-down "v" shape on a piece of paper. Hold the paper sideways, so that it is in "landscape" form.
 They both should be about 3 or so inches long.
 Underneath it, write out the name of your protagonist, and a trait that makes them distinctive. Do the same for the antagonist. Then list the other important characters and their interaction with the protagonist or antagonist.
, Remember, this is the biggest event in your story.
 Then comes the falling action. This is usually the last conflict that the protagonist encounters, and towards the end of the story, where he defeats the antagonist. This will be on the right side of the "v" on the witch's hat.
 Finally, there is the resolution. This is the ending of the story, where all the conflicts are resolved. This is on the right horizontal line of the diagram.


This is what the final product should look like. The witch's hat diagram is good for novels+ and short stories. NOT for books that are in or part of a series.
