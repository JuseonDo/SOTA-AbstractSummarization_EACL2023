 This game really requires more than about 10 people to play per team, that's why its commonly played at schools.;
, A level floor playing surface is adequate enough, however, more often this game is played in a large gymnasium or other large open area where it is deemed acceptable to play a game similar to kickball.
 Although you can use whatever "base" you'd like to use,as long as it's large enough for all the players to stand on the bases at the same time. The bases themselves tend to be gymnasium mats (thereby the reason why this game is called Matball).
 Crossing that imaginary line makes the kicking player automatically safe. Most often times, this imaginary line is centered at the direct center of the area of the gymnasium floor - all so that the kicking player can have room to take action on the ball when it arrives.
, The kicker can either kick the ball and begin running the bases, or they let it slide past and into whatever is behind them. However, the outcome of missing this ball can be deemed to be either an out or just a miss, but must be based solely on the umpire or other officials officiating the game.
 They can either run to the right (much like the current game of baseball) or towards the left and run from base to base until they reach home.
 You can have many players on one single mat.


Sometimes, game officials give the teams an ultimatum when they reach base, in hopes that they are not called "out" at any time (outs are discussed a little later). They can continue running in hopes not to get stopped by any one baseball fielder near the mat, or they can stop and safely rest on the mat.
Recognize what should happen in the case the player oversteps a base (even by just one foot). Most often times the game official gives players the opportunity to lead with their one lead foot, however, they must not come off the base or they can be thrown out to be considered "out". Most often times, once you leave a base, you can't return again to that same base.
 Games vary from location to location and include (but are not limited to) these two universally-accepted rules.


If the ball is kicked behind home plate, it is considered to be a foul ball.
If the ball hits the ceiling of the location traveling forward, it is either a foul or out (dependent on location rules).
 An out for a player is recorded when either the player has swung their leg and missed on several attempted kicks or when they swing and kick but the fielder catches with their hands, when the running player gets tagged while running the bases or during an altercation in the game that causes the out.
 If the location's doors are open in front of home plate and the ball heads out the doors, some places consider the ball to be live at all times until the fielding team retrieves it, or it may be considered a home run. Sometimes if the game is played indoors inside a gymnasium and there are basketball hoops that have been raised and the ball travels into or through the baskets, it's an automatic home run, but that's only a general advisement and not a required idea to determine.


Recognize that there are more scenarios than what are posed here, but vary widely upon each individual situation the location encounters.
, Sometimes, interference can be called in the field when some members of the fielding team are playing their position in or near the basepath and/or to a certain extent so that the running player must collide with them to get to their next base. If this error is recorded, the player can safely be marked as safe on the next base, and the player who committed the error must sit out until the next inning or till the end of the game and can't be up to bat unless these players are elementary school age and are just learning the game.
, Sometimes, as long as theirs a ball in play and their is a runner on a base (or is running the bases) these teammates can continue running the bases. However, if you want, you can tell the teams that they have to stop after (x) amount of runs.
 After several outs have been recorded by the kicking team, the side is out. If all players reach base without leaving any other players behind, you may end up waiting for someone to make a mistake and have all players leave their bases, but that won't happen very often.
 Repeat this play after the two teams switch places (the kicking teams becomes the fielding team and the fielding team becomes the kicking team).
 The team at the end of a few rounds or the one to record the most runs will win and the game will be over.
