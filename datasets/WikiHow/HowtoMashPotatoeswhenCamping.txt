 Boiling is best, but baking works too if you're cooking over coals.;
, Give it a good wipe down to ensure that it is clean.
, Keep pushing the can down until the potatoes are mashed to an even enough consistency.
, Goes well with baked beans, anything out of a packet, and bread. It won't be as smooth as what you're used to out of the kitchen but it will taste just as good and solve everyone's hunger!
