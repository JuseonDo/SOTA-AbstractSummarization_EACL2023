 If you can, shut off the the power to the pump.
 Turn the air relief valve on the top of the pool filter counterclockwise (anticlockwise). The gauge should read 0 psi. Leave this valve open.
 There should be one for the main drain and one or more for the skimmer lines.
 Depending on your box, you may need to turn a knob counterclockwise (anticlockwise) and possibly do some unscrewing.
 If you see anything, take the basket out of the strainer box, clean and replace.

Check the lid of the strainer box and its seal. Note if there are any cracks or any other signs of damage.
Apply petroleum jelly or a similar lubricant to the O-ring.
Tighten lid. Do so by hand when possible to avoid over tightening.
 This disengages the filtration system from the circuitry, allowing the water to flow through the pump without distraction.
,


Air should begin to come out of the valve as the pump starts up again. If all goes well, water should start to spray out of the pump.
If water does not spray within a minute, repeat all steps up until this point.
 Turn the knob clockwise to close.
 Some manufacturers may recommend opening the main drain valve first.
 Any problematic air from newly opened circuitry should begin to come out of the valve. If all goes well, water should start to spray.


If water does not spray within a minute, repeat all steps up until this point.
 Turn the knob clockwise to close.
 If you find that no water sprays for any valve along the way, repeat all steps until this point.

Be sure to bleed air from the filter once water circulation to the filter has been reestablished.
