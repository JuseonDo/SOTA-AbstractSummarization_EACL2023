 For a wide veil, use a 108 inch (2.7 m) width, and for a smaller veil, use a 72 inch (1.8 m) width. It is a good idea to buy up to 8 feet (2.4Â m) of tulle so that you can cut it to your desired length.;
, You will want to decide how long you want your veil to be from the top of your head and write down the measurement. This will depend upon your height and preference.
 Fold it vertically, placing the fold toward you. This may match the fold lines from the store.


You may want to vacuum your carpet well before laying down delicate tulle fabric on its surface.
 Take the right edge and gently align it with the left edge.
 Keep it in its folded form. Cut any excess from the left side and not the side that has been folded in.
 Lay the platter over the top left side of the veil. Mark the curve over that corner with pins.
, It should have curved corners on all sides now.
