 A good amount to measure out is two teaspoons of each product. Even separately, these two products are good at removing hair dye stains. Together, they’re almost a sure solution.


To avoid irritating the skin, choose a mild detergent that doesn't have a lot of added fragrances or dyes.
 This is an optional step; on its own, lemon juice won’t remove hair dye stains, but it can boost the effect of the other two products being used in this case.
 A dry washcloth won’t pick up as much of the mixture, and you’ll have a harder time getting the stain off your skin.


You can also use cotton balls or your fingers, but a washcloth will do a better job of rubbing it into the stain.
 Rub gently at the stain, making sure not the irritate the skin or rub yourself raw. Depending on how much dye you have on your skin, this might take some time, so be patient.


Re-wet the washcloth and re-apply the baking soda and dishwashing detergent mixture to it as necessary.
 Use a face cleaning product to make sure your face is clear of all products that don’t belong there.


If the stain isn’t completely removed at this point, repeat the process as many times as is necessary.
 Baking soda can really dry your skin out, so you want to give it a moisture boost after you get the stain out.
