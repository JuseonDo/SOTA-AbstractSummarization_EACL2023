 Prepare the cake pan by greasing or lining it.;
,, Add the sugar and stir together.
 Combine until it looks like fine breadcrumbs.
 Pour the milk in and stir through with a butter knife. Do not mix too much.
 Place the dough onto it and knead gently.
 It should be about 2cm/0.78".
 Make about 18-20 scones (if you make a lot less, it's probable that the scones are too large in shape).
 Stand them next to each other, touching. Then sieve a little flour over the top of the scones in the pan.
 Bake for 10-12 minutes or until they turn golden brown in color.
 Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove and wrap in a clean towel inside a bowl to keep them warm.
 Spread the jam on and add dollops of whipped cream. Display with other petits fours on a cake stand or platter.
