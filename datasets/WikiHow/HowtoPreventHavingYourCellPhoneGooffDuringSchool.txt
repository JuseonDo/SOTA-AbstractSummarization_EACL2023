 You may not want to do this, if you plan to use your cell phone during school. If this is the case, then keep your phone on vibrate.


Turn the vibration off as well.;
, This is because your cell phone turns on when certain buttons are pressed, and you want to avoid having those buttons pressed. Keeping your cell phone in your bag is a bad idea if it doesn't have a cover because your bag will move around, and so will your cell phone. Then, those buttons may be pressed, and your phone could turn on. So make sure your cell phone has a cell phone case.
 Again, you may not want to do this if you want to use your cell phone during class, but it's worth consideration because if it does go off, it will be in your locker, and the chances of somebody being right next to your locker when your phone goes off are very slim.
 Skip this step if you plan to text your friends during school. This will decrease your chances of your phone going off.
 You can do this in your phones settings. Consider reading the manual if you are confused.
 Surely he would allow your phone after a conversation with your parent.
 That way you will prevent butt dialing, which is accidentally pressing numbers with your butt and could cause you to call or text someone.
