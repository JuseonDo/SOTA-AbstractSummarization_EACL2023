 As you'll need to put the plastic sheet into the oven, this is your size limitation.;
, The example here is the outside of a mold, but it can work inside, too.
 The only major variable that can affect the forming process is the thickness of the plastic sheet. This article uses a sheet about 1/4" thick, so all times are about 10 to 15 minutes per step. For thicker sheets, it will take longer, and for thinner sheets, it will take less time. Modify the timing as necessary.
 Make sure the sheet is just big enough for the form. Use a plastic cutting knife to cut the sheet down to the general overall size.
 This should include any interior cutouts, corners, etc.
 When it's ready you'll find it flexible when you try to pick it up.
 It's hot and will burn you if you're not careful.
 using the heavy shears or scissors. You'll have about 2 minutes before it cools and hardens too much to cut. If it gets too hard, put it back in the oven to warm up again.
 Above that temperature it can melt and/or begin to bubble.
 use your fingers and firm pressure to press into any corners, fold, bends, etc. Continue to hold and press into shape until it begins to harden.
,, If there are a few curves or bends that need correcting, you can turn on a burner on low to pass the piece back and forth over to SLOWLY heat it up for localized bends.
