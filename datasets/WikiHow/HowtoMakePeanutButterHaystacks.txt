 Arrange the bread into two rows. You can use as much or as little bread as you'd like.;
, In it, combine both the 3 1/2 cups of coconut flakes and the amount of peanut butter desired, stirring until all of the coconut flakes have peanut butter on them.
 Start spreading the the peanut butter and flakes onto only one side of just the first bread slice.
 Be sure that you leave the other bread slices without a spread, as they'll go on top of the sides that have the spread on them.
 The cinnamon should go on only the slice with the spread on it.
 Serve the sandwiches as soon as possible.
