 Trust me when you turn on, the phone is laggy and you couldn't type well.
 First, lets get started with the "New Message" button.
 To switch between capital letters and lowercase letters, press 0 once. Then you might notice the upper left corner, an icon with the arrow pointing upwards might appear. To type 0, press 0 for a while. Then, you may see the 0 number appear. To space, press the * button once. To switch between languages, press the # button for a while. To change between symbols, dictionary mode, and numerical mode, press the "#" button once. To delete the previous character, press the "back" button.
 Like, if you access the music software, the controls change between 12 key to the iPod-like controls.
 To skip a track, press the side controls |<< or >>|. To fast forward, use the trackpad (the C shaped control on the front ). To shuffle, press the shuffle button once. To repeat the entire playlist/ all songs, press the the repeat button. To repeat the song, press it again. You might notice the repeat and shuffle signs beside the album picture.
 To zoom/ minimize, press the coordinating buttons on the ModeShift Keypad. You can shift from video mode or picture mode directly from the ModeShift Keypad. You can also access your pictures directly from there. By pressing the button.
