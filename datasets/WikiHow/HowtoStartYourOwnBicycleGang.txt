 You can't be in a bicycle gang unless you got some wheels. Check out your local dealers for bikes.;
,, I normally pick top floors of multi-story car parks as they are mostly abandoned and it also makes for a great place to race. You can try your local parks, abandoned lots or warehouses. Wherever it is, make sure it is legal to cycle there. If not, make sure you have good escape routes in case the cops come knocking around.
 Swap tips, practice tricks and race. This is to build up your skills. You can't be a biker just cause you have the ride. You got to have the skills to prove it.
 If you can print the patches on a jacket, its even better. Your patch identifies your gang, so make sure people can see it.
 Race each other on empty streets. Perform stunts while riding around. Do anything to build notoriety.
 Race them to see if your gang is tops. If you win, good for you. If not, it's back to practicing, then challenge them again.
 Maintain your reputation by winning races and claiming turf.
