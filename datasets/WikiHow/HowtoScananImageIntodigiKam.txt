 This is what you will see. It shouldn't be grayed out.;
, Here, Flatbed has been chosen.
 Your options are color, black and white, and line art.
 If your image will only be seen on the Internet, there is no reason to go above 72 DPI. If you will be wanting to work with it and manipulate it, you might want to choose a higher DPI. Just remember:






Lower DPI - smaller image - faster loading pages
Higher DPI - larger image - slows the browsers down - more post processing options
