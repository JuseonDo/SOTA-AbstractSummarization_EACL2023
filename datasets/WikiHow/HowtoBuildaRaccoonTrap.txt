;
, (30.48 cm) long pieces from the 2x2 in. (5.08 x 5.08 cm) lumber. These will be the corner supports.
 (1.27 cm) thick plywood to two pieces - one 12x36 in. (30.48 cm x 91.44 cm) and one 12x38 in. (30.48 cm x 96.52 cm). The shorter of the two will be the top of the trap; the longer will be the bottom.
 Place the shorter (top) plywood piece flat and nail the four corner supports to the corners of the plywood. Place the longer (bottom) plywood piece on top of the supports, lining up one short edge of the top piece with the short edge of the bottom piece and nailing it to the four support pieces. Allow 2 in. (5.08 cm) of the bottom piece to hang past the supports - this will be the front of the raccoon trap.
 Trim the wire to the dimensions of the trap with wire cutters and secure it to the wood with a staple gun, leaving the front of the trap open.
 (5.08 cm x 1.9 cm) lumber. Cut whatever is used to 24 in. (60.96 cm) and nail to the front supports of the trap, with the grooves facing inward, toward each other.
 (35.56 cm) high and just wide enough to fit into the grooves of the tracks. This will be the door of the trap. Be sure the door slides freely in the track so that it will fall quickly when the track is triggered.
 (2.54 cm) from the bottom edge.
 (7.62 to 10.16 cm) from the back of the trap. Make sure that the hammer bar of the unset trap is facing the back of the trap before you secure it to the wood.
 (2.54 cm) longer than the distance from the hammer bar of the set mousetrap to the door of the raccoon trap. Tie one end of the string or wire to the hammer bar and another to a nail, right behind the head of the nail.
 The hole should go through the mousetrap and continue through the top of the raccoon trap.
 Tie a slipknot by feeding one end of the string up from the inside through the hole on the top of the trap. Tie it to the bait pan of the mousetrap.
 When the raccoon takes the bait, the bait string will pull on the bait pan, setting off the mousetrap, causing the hammer bar to pull the nail out of the whole, allowing the door to fall and trap the animal inside.
