, Large potatoes serve one person each, but you'll need 3 or 4 smaller potatoes per person.
 Smaller chunks will get crispier, and large chunks will be creamy inside.
 Toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper.


Consider adding more seasonings like garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, or chili powder.






Other oils such as peanut oil, vegetable oil, or canola oil also work.
 Brushing oil on the baking sheet is also another way to prevent potatoes from sticking to the baking sheet.
 Place the sheet in the oven.
 Remove them from the oven and toss them with tongs or a spatula, then return them to the oven for 15 minutes.
 They should be brown and crispy, but not burned.
