 Plaster of Paris can be purchased from many craft stores. Mix 1 cup of plaster compound with ½ cup water.This should provide enough plaster for several eggs. Stir the mixture until it has a smooth and creamy texture, like a thin milkshake.


Do not pour excess plaster of Paris down the drain, as it can harden and clog pipes.;
, Make sure to insert the end of the funnel far enough into a balloon so that it won’t fall out or spill the plaster.


Alternatively, you could fill a clean squeeze bottle with plaster of Paris so that you can squirt it into the balloon.
 Fill the balloon until it is nice and round. Be careful not to fill the balloon so much that it can burst.
 Close the end of the balloon with a tight not and/or tie it closed with a piece of string.
 This ensures that you do not have a dinosaur egg that is flat on one side. The setting process may take up to several hours (follow the plaster of Paris package instructions for details).
 Carefully cut or peel the rest of the balloon off. Smooth out any rough spots with sandpaper.
 Then, you can decorate them with paint, glitter, etc. Have fun and use your imagination!
