 Make sure you have nothing planned on. The easiest way is to pick a day you want, and ask your parents if you have anything planned. It is okay the reschedule.;
, Pick some new ones and some old favorites, but be sure not to add too many.
 Pick which one you are going to play first. See which ones interest you most

, You can change these in the later steps if you have excess time or too less time. Try not to go over your bedtime.
 If you have too many games, remove some.
 A DS (If you won't play with it during your marathon), some computer programs can do this (disable sleep), a cell phone or a regular alarm clock can do this.
 Sitting for long periods of time isn't good for your health. Get up and walk around the block every couple of hours.
