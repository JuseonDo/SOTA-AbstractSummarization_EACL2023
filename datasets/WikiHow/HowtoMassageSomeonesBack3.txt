vary touch from light to firm, you can drag fingers lightly as if tickling, then alternate with firm or intermediate levels of touch.

@summary
gentle chops are another way to vary the touch.

@summary
don't limit touch to hands alone, another useful way to alternate touch is to use your elbow.

@summary
a knuckle massage is also effective, but like the elbow technique caution must be taken (in intensity and location).

@summary
skin rolling is another way to vary your technique.

, Relax your hand and in a chopping motion pat the clients back. Keep in mind the motion should come from the arm and you should offer no resistance from the fingers or wrist.
 This must be used gently to avoid causing pain. Do not cross the client's spine when using this technique! This technique is especially effective for masseurs who have weak or fatigued hands.
, If the client has skin that is not hyper extended, it often feels very good. Pinch with both hands starting by placing your thumb and forefingers about four inches apart. Then "pinch" down to about half the distance. Then grab the next couple of inches a finger at a time allowing the previous grab to slide under your thumb. Your forefingers end up crawling and your thumb keeps the "roll" in check and sliding forward. The easiest area to do this is side by side the spine, but not on it. You end (or don't begin) when it is difficult to grab a roll.
