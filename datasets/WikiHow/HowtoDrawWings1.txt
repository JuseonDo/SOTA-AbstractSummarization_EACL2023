 They should look like connected tree branches, or the skeleton of a bat's arm.;
, They should be mostly oval-like in shape, overlapping one another but not going beyond three rows or so per wing.
 These can be as thick or as lengthy as you like, but try to keep even the proportions of these feathers and the feathers from the previous step.
 You don't necessarily need to have too many extra lines or spots on your feathers, but the image at the right will show you how if you want those elements.
 To create a set, if your character is being viewed from the front rather than the side, simply mirror the drawing you've already done on the other side. And remember, when detailing/coloring, use your imagination!
