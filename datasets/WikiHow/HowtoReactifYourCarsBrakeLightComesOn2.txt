 Your brakes should remain completely functional. If this occurs often, you should get it checked out by a mechanic.
 The anti-locking system will shut down leaving only normal braking ability.


The ABS will not engage on wet or slippery surfaces or during an emergency braking maneuver. Get your anti-lock brakes examined by a mechanic as soon as you can.
 Pull over immediately and call for help. The vehicle is no longer safe to drive .
