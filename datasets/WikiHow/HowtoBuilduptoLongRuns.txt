 Take good note of that – don’t make all of your runs longer. If you’ve been running 3 miles (4.8 km) a day (for example) 3-4 times a week, don’t suddenly make all your runs 4 miles (6.4 km). Just pick one day a week to go longer.;
, It’s not good to keep increasing without rest — so if you increase for 2-3 weeks straight, cut back on your long run one week before progressing the next. This means that if your long run progresses each week like so:


3.5 miles (5.6 km), 4 miles (6.4 km), then 4.5 miles (7.2 km).
Take a cut-back week where you just do 3.5 miles (5.6 km) on the fourth week.
Then go back to 4.5 miles (7.2 km), then 5 miles (8.0 km), and so on.
, Do your long runs a little slower at first — later, when long runs aren’t a problem for you, you can do faster-paced ones, but that’s more of an intermediate/advanced tactic.
