limit the amount of attached lights.

@summary
you can get around this three string "limitation" by using inexpensive outdoor outlet power stakes.

@summary
plug the mini-light strings into the outlets on the power stakes.

@summary
there seems to be no problem daisy chaining power stakes, so you can plug additional power stakes into these six outlets to give you even more outlets.

 Do not put more than three strings of mini-lights end-to-end.;
, These are three (or more) outlets on a stake that you push into the ground. Some models have timers which can be set for a period of hours or from dawn to dusk. This is useful with Christmas lights. Assuming you have two outdoor electrical outlets, plug a power stake into each one. That gives you a total of six outlets.
 Each outlet should have a maximum of three strings plugged end to end. Six outlets accommodate a total of eighteen strings.
 The key is to never plug more than three strings of min-lights together.
