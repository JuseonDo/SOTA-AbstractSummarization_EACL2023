 Hoes can also be used to chop off annual weeds (perennial weeds must be dug out and removed) and other plants at ground level. A weeding hoe has a short handle and a two-sided tool head. One side of the tool head is narrow and the other side has 2 or 3 tines.
 Cultivators are used in a chopping and pulling motion to remove shallow rooted weeds, and to break up surface soil crust around plants.


It is convenient to have both a long-handled and a short-handled cultivator so that you can easily reach all your plants.
 Weeders look like wide screwdrivers, except they have a notch on one end. This long narrow design allows you to dig down the side of the taproot of dandelions and other deep rooted weeds.
 Hand cultivators allow you to dig down and remove the tap roots of perennial weeds without needing to strain your back by bending over repeatedly.
 Gardening trowels look like miniature shovels and are invaluable, especially during planting season. Drop shank trowels are for general gardening use. Straight shank trowels are for planting bulbs.
 Landscaping rakes are similar to steel garden rakes, except that they are wider and the back of the rake head is straight and even.
 They are a must item you will need to care for your landscaping plants.
