If making your own, either paper or cellophane bags can be used. Paper bags can be jazzed up with drawings, patterns, stamps, etc.; while cellophane bags can be improved with stickers or glued-on images.
Choose colors matching the party theme.;
, The candies can be matched to the party theme or simply chosen because you know the kids like certain kinds.

Be mindful of any allergies when choosing the candies. If you're not sure, steer clear especially of candies containing nuts. Other allergens include milk, egg, soy and gluten.
 Tip the candies into the bags., Finish with a ribbon or yarn bow.
