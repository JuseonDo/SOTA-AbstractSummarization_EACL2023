@summary
in the case of overflowing toilets, you can shut-off the toilet water supply valve.
@article
 This valve can usually be located between the bathroom floor and the toilet tank, on the water line supplying the toilet.


If this is your plumbing problem, it is not necessary to shut-off the water to the entire home.
