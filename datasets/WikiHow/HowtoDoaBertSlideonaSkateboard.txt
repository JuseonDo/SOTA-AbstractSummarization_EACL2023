 If desired, you can perform this on a waxed surface, but this makes it easier to slip so be careful. The position is back foot on the tail so the turn is easier and the front foot should be on the front bolts so you have more control.;
, A sloped surface like a driveway is a nice place.
 (It is helpful if you crouch down as low as you can before putting your hands down. It takes a lot of pressure off your wrist, thus, less painful.)

,,, There! A Bert Slide.


Bigger spins call for more movement. For a 360 it's the same directions but after 180 degrees flip over and continue.
