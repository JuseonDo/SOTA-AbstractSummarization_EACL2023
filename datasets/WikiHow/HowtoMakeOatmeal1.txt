 To make more oatmeal, add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water per serving., This will give you nice, firm oats. If you want creamier oats, add the oatmeal to the water first, then boil it., To make more servings, add another ½ cup (40 grams). Both rolled oats and old fashioned oatmeal are the same thing; they just have two different names. This type of oatmeal is your standard oatmeal, and it looks like flakes.
 Eventually, the oatmeal will begin to absorb the water and thicken.
 There are certain items that you can add to your oatmeal while it is cooking, while others are best left for the very end. Here are some suggestions:


For a savory oatmeal, add a pinch of salt and some butter.
For a sweeter oatmeal, stir in some honey or maple syrup. You can also use some brown sugar and cinnamon.
For a hearty oatmeal, stir in some raisins or dried cranberries. You can also use sliced almonds or crumbled walnuts or pecans.
 The longer you cook your oatmeal, the thicker and softer it will become.









Once the oatmeal has cooked, consider covering the pot with a lid and let it sit (off the heat) for 2 minutes. This will allow the oatmeal to absorb any extra moisture., You can add some toppings to enhance the flavor and make it even more filling. Here are some ideas for toppings:


For a sweeter oatmeal, use brown sugar, cinnamon, honey, or maple syrup.
For a creamier oatmeal, add some cream or butter.
For a fruity oatmeal, add some milk or cream, and top with blueberries, chopped peaches, or cut strawberries. You can also use diced apples and a pinch of cinnamon.
For a heartier oatmeal, add some raisins or dried cranberries. You can also used sliced almonds or crumbled walnuts or pecans.
