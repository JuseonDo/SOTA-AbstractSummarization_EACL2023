 If you want more of one color, for example two blues, then you're going to have to get it from another controller. Just make sure that the controller has the same kind of fret buttons (since there are two kinds).;
, You will notice there are several screw holes with star shaped screws in them they are called torx screws and you will need a torx screwdriver for them.
 Look for a circuit board in the neck. You will also have to unscrew this in order to get to the fret buttons.
