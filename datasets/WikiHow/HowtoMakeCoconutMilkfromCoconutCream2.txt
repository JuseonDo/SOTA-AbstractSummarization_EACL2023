 You can make this by the cup or by the quart.
 Pour the coconut cream into two bowls, in even amounts.
 Mix it at the ratio of about 1 ounce of coconut cream to either 7 or 8 ounces of packaged coconut water.
 You now have coconut milk made at home.
 Refrigerate if storing, or follow the freezer method in the Tips.
