 Separate and part each section of your hair until your entire scalp has been covered. Part the hair into four sections, using hair clips or pins. You should have a cross in your hair.

, Make thin parts applying the cream relaxer to the new growth with a relaxer brush without missing spots. Try concentrating on just applying the relaxer to the new growth and not the scalp. Move on to the next section and so fourth.
 Gently comb through the new growth of each section of hair. The texture of your hair will determine how long to leave the relaxer in your hair. (Refer to product instructions)








, Ideally you should apply a light protein conditioner and keep it in for 5 minutes, then rinse, before neutralizing. Lines such as Affirm have this conditioner as part of their system and it's vital to rebuilding the hair shaft.
 This kind of shampoo allows the relaxer to discontinue the relaxing process and prevents breakage. When shampooing the hair, make sure you work up a good lather and completely rinse out the relaxer. (Color-activated neutralizers are available as well. They indicate the amount of relaxer left in your hair.)








, After rinsing your hair, pat dry the excess water from the hair. Apply deep conditioner to all parts of the hair. Comb it through and let it sit for three to five minutes. Hot oil treatments work wonders, too.
 Towel dry the wet hair, comb through and style as usual.
