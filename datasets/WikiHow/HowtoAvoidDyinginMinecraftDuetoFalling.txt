 Avoid the danger of falling by clogging up ravines, caves, and other holes with dirt, wood, stone, or other common materials. Don't use gravel, sand, eggs, or anvils because they obey gravity.;
, If you see lots of caves and ravines, then it's not a good mining place. One thing you should know about Minecraft is that caves are not too deep, but they are filled with monsters so it still is not good to fall into a mineshaft or cave.
