 If you can prevent an encounter with a band, the rest of the steps are unnecessary., Poorly built houses are not acceptable., An ocelot, which is a type of wild cat, is a good choice. There are also lions, tigers, cougars, leopards, and jaguars available., Aggressive bands like The Rolling Stones and The Beatles are not afraid to hurt you., The Dave Clark Five are excellent climbers (although they are not dangerous and may just sit in the tree with you), The Rolling Stones and The Beatles can climb a little, and any other band other than Monkees cannot climb at all.,
