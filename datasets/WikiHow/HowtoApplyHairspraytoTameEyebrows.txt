 If you do not have a can of hairspray, you can just use water but the hairspray makes it last longer and also maintains a firm hold.
 Make sure that the toothbrush is clean and is dry or otherwise the hairspray will not work properly., Slowly stroke your eyebrows in the direction that you want your eyebrows to stay., Take some selfies or hit the town with your friends. Be proud to show off your eyebrows and you can continue these steps every day if you are happy with the way that it looks.
