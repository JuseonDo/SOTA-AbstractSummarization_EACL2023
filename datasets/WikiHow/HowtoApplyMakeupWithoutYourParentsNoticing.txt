 Think about why your parents don't want you wearing makeup, and think deeply about why you want to. Know that your parents mean well, but that it isn't your duty to obey them unconditionally. Have a conversation with your parents and tell them why you want to wear makeup (e.g. improving self-esteem, feeling beautiful, motivating your dreams, etc.).;
, If your parents question your reasons, simply tell them it's for your costume. You won't be lying!

, Learn what matches your skin. If you get to a good, quality department store, ask at the cosmetics counter if you can get some tips.
 Your parents were your age once, too. They know you are going to use it. They want to see it used responsibly.
,, Use the tip of the applier. Make sure that the shade isn't too dark though, otherwise you'll be WAY too obvious or you'll look like you have huge circles under your eyes.
 The Revlon Colorstay® is perfect. If you can't get any lip gloss, cherry lip balm is nice too.
 Make sure to take it off right after school.
