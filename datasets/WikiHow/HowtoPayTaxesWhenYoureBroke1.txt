The amount of tax you owe is $10,000 or less.
During the last 5 years, you promptly filed your tax returns and paid taxes due.
The IRS determines you can't pay the taxes based on the documentation you provide.
You commit to paying the full tax due within 36 months and comply with all tax laws during this period.;
,,,, (If you mail the tax return after March 31, the response time could be longer.) Whether it's approved or denied, you'll receive a response either way.
 If it's approved, the response will detail the terms of the agreement, along with a fee request to implement the agreement. Penalties and interest charges for late payment will continue to accrue until the tax is paid in full.
