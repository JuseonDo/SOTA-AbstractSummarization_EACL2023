 A passcode is a four-digit code that you can use to lock your device. It is not possible to bypass the passcode to access the information on the phone.;
,,, You will be asked to enter it again to confirm.
 This will allow you to change the amount of time until your iPhone requires the passcode to unlock. For more security, choose a lower time.
 There are several apps that make themselves available if the phone is locked for your convenience. You can toggle these off by tapping the slider next to each app.
 If your device is stolen and the wrong code is entered ten times, your iPhone will automatically delete all of its stored information.
