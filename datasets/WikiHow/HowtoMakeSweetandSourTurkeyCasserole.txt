, Then wipe the chopping board down, turn over board, and slice the meat

Caution: Wash the board thoroughly before cutting vegetables, if meat is prepared first to avoid salmonella, etc.

You can use a toothpick to pierce each breast piece, if sliced very thick, and pull the toothpick out to see whether it comes out clean. If so it is done.
 Add the diced onions to the frying pan and turn down heat., Then drain the cooking water. Or, alternatively, don't use raw sweet potatoes, as a tremendous time saver:


Use canned sweet potatoes/yams. Buy one or two large can(s) of sweet potatoes for ease, saving about over 1/2 an hour preparing and cooking them.
, Add the jars of sweet and sour cooking sauce and stir everything in casserole dish until evenly coated with cooking sauce. Then put casserole lid on and bake in the oven for 45-50 minutes.
