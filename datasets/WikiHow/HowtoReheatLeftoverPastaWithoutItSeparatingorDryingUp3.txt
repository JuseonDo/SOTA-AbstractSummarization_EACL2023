 This is one of the easiest ways to heat pasta. Just add melted butter or oil to a frying pan, add the pasta, and heat. Stir occasionally.


Add more sauce if the pasta looks dry.
 These easily separated sauces should be heated over very low heat. For lower risk of separation, see the cream sauce method below.
 Cut yourself a slab and toss it on the pan, cut side down. Rotate occasionally, heating each cut side until crispy.
