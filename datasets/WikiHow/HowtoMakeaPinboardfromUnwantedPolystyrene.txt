 If you cannot get a box with a lid, cut down the sides of the box and use the base instead (or the sides if they are the right shape and size for your needs). In fact, you can make several pinboards out of the entire box if you like!;
, Give it a wipe down with warm, soapy water and leave to dry.
 Using a pencil with an eraser end, gently push a design into the board. The indentations should be very minor but distinctive enough that you can make out the design. It is important to plan the design on paper in advance. Shapes, animals, patterns, etc. are good choices.
 The paint should be acrylic. A little pot of test paint is perfect for this project.
 Paint over the imprinted design and paint to the edges of the pinboard.
 Once dry, hang the pinboards in place (hang string through two little holes or use stick-ons suitable for a wall) and use as wished.
