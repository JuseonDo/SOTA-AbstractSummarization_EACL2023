A mobile kitchen service can offer all sorts of different menus, from hot dogs, French fries, and popcorn to healthy soups, sandwiches, and salads.
Bear in mind that a mobile kitchen service has space and equipment restrictions that will limit the types of foods you can produce.;
,, In addition, describe how you intend to reach your customers, what your management plan is, and how much revenue you expect to make in your first 2 years based on profit margins of the food products you sale.

Register your mobile kitchen service with your city to obtain your business license.
If you're planning to employ staff, apply for an employer's identification number (EIN) with your tax authority.

If you're buying a used mobile kitchen service or renting one, make sure it contains all necessary basic equipment such as a sink, refrigerator, freezer, and counter top.
If you're buying a new mobile kitchen or concession trailer, you can specify exactly which equipment you want in addition to the basics, such as a sandwich prep unit, additional sink, deep fryer, or griddle.



Contact your city's parking authorities to find out where you're allowed to park to sell your food products.
Enquire at local business parks whether they'll permit you to sell your products on site. Most will do so for a small fee.
