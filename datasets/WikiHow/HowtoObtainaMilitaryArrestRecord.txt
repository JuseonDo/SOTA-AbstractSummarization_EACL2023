 If you are unsure of the service number, date and place of birth may suffice.
 Unless you are next-of-kin, you must have the service-person's permission, since military arrest records are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

The following are considered as next-of-kin: current spouse and immediate family (mother, father, daughter, son, sister, or brother).
The authorization must be in writing and must specify that the arrest records may be released to you. The authorization must also include the signature of the service-person, or if deceased, the service-person's next-of-kin.
 You can pick up a form from your local Veterans Administration office or request a form by mail.

Mail or fax in your form. Federal law states that all requests for military records must be submitted in writing, with a hand-written signature and date.
Pay any charges associated with your request. The NPRC will notify you as soon as possible regarding the amount of your payment. Service-persons or their next-of-kin are allowed to request copies of records for free, but members of the general public will be charged a nominal fee.
Wait up to 12 weeks for a response. The Military Personnel Records division of NPRC receives almost 5,000 requests per day. While most responses are given within 2 weeks, arrest records dating from 1973 and earlier may take much longer.
Find out the status of your request by contacting the NPRC Customer Service Center. It's best to wait at least 10 business days before checking with them. Email them at mpr.status@nara.gov, or call them at 314-801-0800. Note that their telephone number is not toll-free number.
 Make sure to include the necessary personal information and authorization, if required. Branch addresses are:
