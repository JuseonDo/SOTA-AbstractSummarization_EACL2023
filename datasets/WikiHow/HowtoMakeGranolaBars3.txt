 Place an oven rack in the middle of the oven. , Combine 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour, ½ cup of whole-wheat flour, 3/4 cup of quick oats, ¼ cup of ground flax seeds, ¼ cup of wheat germ,1 tsp. of baking soda, 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. of salt, and ½ tsp. of baking powder together. Stir the ingredients to blend the flavors.
 Use a stand mixer to cream together 1 stick of unsalted butter at room temperature,½ cup of coconut oil,½ cup of brown sugar, 1/3 cup of honey, and 1/3 cup of peanut butter. Continue to cream them until the mixture is smooth and creamy – this should take about 4 minutes. To thoroughly mix the ingredients, scrape down the bowl halfway through.
 Stir the egg into the rest of the ingredients until it’s thoroughly combined with them.
 Mix them together until you’ve created one incorporated mixture.
 Fold in 1 3/4 cup of granola, 1 cup of dried cherries, and ½ cup of unsweetened shredded coconut into the mixture.
,, Cover it with plastic wrap.
 You can do this with your hands or a spatula or another flat cooking utensil.
 Bake it until the edges start to brown and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
 Let it cool in the pan for 15-20 minutes. This will make the granola harden a bit.
 Let it cool for 2-3 more hours. If you move the granola too soon, it will crumble.
 Use a large knife or a bench scraper to cut the granola. The bars should be about 3 x 1 inches each.
 Enjoy this delicious tasty treat any time.
