 This is safe for baby’s who will have more difficulty with the spit rather than swallow action that is required with toothpaste. This can be used until the age of 3 years.
 A drop no larger than a pea is all that is required.
 If you decide to use toothpaste with fluoride, be sure to decrease the amount used from a pea size drop to a grain of rice size drop to avoid giving too much fluoride to baby.
 This will assist with diluting any paste that has been swallowed, which is particularly important if using a paste that contains fluoride.
