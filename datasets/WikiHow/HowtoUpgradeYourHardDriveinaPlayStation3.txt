Plug the external USB hard drive into one of the PS3's USB ports.
In the Xross Media Bar go to Settings > System Settings > Backup Utility.
Follow the on screen directions and select "Back Up" to back up all game saves, downloads, media and game installs to the USB drive.
Disconnect the USB drive when backup is complete.
,, Mine is a bit larger than the other visible screws and colored blue.
,, Then insert it into the PS3 and slide to the left with the little handle until it pops into place. You can then fasten it with the first screw you removed and replace the plastic cover.
 You will be prompted to format the new hard drive. It will ask you if you are sure and just click yes until it begins the formatting process. Wait patiently during the formatting process. It may take several minutes. At this point, on occasion, the console may refuse to run due to the appropriate firmware not being present, simply download the firmware from the official Sony Playstation site, save it to a USB stick in a file called UPDATE, itself in a file called PS3, and then plug the USB stick into a USB socket on the console


Once formatted, you have completed the process and you can utilize the greater storage capacity.



Reconnect the USB drive to a USB port on the PS3.
Go to Settings > System Settings > Backup Utility in the Xross Media bar. Select Restore from the onscreen menu.
All backed up material should now be restored from the external USB drive to the new hard drive you just installed.
