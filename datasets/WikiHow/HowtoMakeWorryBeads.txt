 Traditionally, worry beads have an odd number of beads, usually one more than a multiple of four, 5, 9, 13, etc. Additionally, you will need one "shield" bead, usually somewhat larger than the others. Natural materials such as stone, amber, and wood are considered more pleasant to handle, but you may use any type of bead you like.
 (optional), Typically, the length of a loop of worry beads is two hand widths, so cut your cord at least 4 hand widths long, plus enough room to attach the shield and tassel.,,, A simple overhand knot will work fine so long as the diameter of the string is close to the inside diameter of the bead hole. If your string is significantly smaller than the holes in your beads, you may need to use a bulkier knot.,,
