@summary
for a bigger teddy, wrap some fabric around where their shirt would be, and cut out arm holes.
@article
 Make sure the sock is tidy and good-looking before you start, and clean. Choose a cute sock, as it will be teddy's PJ's "fabric".
 This will make two pieces, measuring the same size.
 Cut a small hole on one side, large enough to fit on your teddy's arm. Cut another small hole on the opposite side, again of a size to fit the arm. These should be in the same place, only on opposite sides. Pull over the teddy's head and push the arms into the new holes. This is now teddy's new PJ's.
 Teddy just got a new sleeping hat!

, You now have a set of epic pajamas for your teddy, made in only a few minutes.
 Then Fabric Glue the fabric together for an easy PJ top!
