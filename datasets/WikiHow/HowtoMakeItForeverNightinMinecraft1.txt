 Press "E" and either search up redstone or find it in the "Redstone" tab.
 You can place them both anywhere, but make it so that they can connect.
 Enter this command right here: /time set night.
 If you want to place them very far apart, use redstone repeaters to expand the amount of power you can have.
 Typing the command /time set day will activate the daylight sensor, powering the redstone and activating the command block, using the command /time set night to turn it back to night.
