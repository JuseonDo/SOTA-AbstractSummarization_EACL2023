,, This pricing will give you a good starting point as you begin negotiations with the seller.
 Since you already know the approximate value, give a fair price that is slightly under book value, while at the same time knocking down price depending on the condition of the vehicle.
 Determine if the seller is going to have it shipped to you, if he or she is going to deliver it, if you have to have someone drive you to pick it up, or if you will fly to that person's location and drive it home.
