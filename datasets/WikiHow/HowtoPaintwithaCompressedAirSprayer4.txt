 If you have a significant amount of paint left, you can return it to the original can; remember, however, that the amount you return to the can has already been thinned, meaning the next time you use it, you may need to adjust the amount of thinner used.


Epoxy paints and paints that use a catalyst (two-part paints) cannot be returned to the original can; they must be used entirely or disposed of properly once mixed.
 Wipe off/out any excess paint.
 If there is too much paint left in the cup or the spray assembly, you may have to repeat this step a few times.
 Do this as soon as the paint job has dried; leaving the tape on the surface for an extended period will allow the adhesive to set, making it difficult to remove.
