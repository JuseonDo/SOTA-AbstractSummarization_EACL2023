 Decide on whether to read fiction written in English, or a book in translation. Decide on a country of origin, a century, a topic of interest.;
, Do a bit of research first. Whether you choose a book or not, go read a little about the author, what is known about how and why the book was written, its historical setting. What was happening at the time it was being written?

, This will give you a preview of the book. For modern books, find reviews in past magazines or newspapers. For older books, read some standard discussions on the book, what English professionals have said in history.
 Try to recognize these as you see them happen. Learn the basic genre of the book, if western, horror, historical, adventure, science fiction, romance, drama, or comedy., Try to find the names and descriptions of main characters, and the setting. When and where does the story happen? Look at the author's writing style, and begin to get used to it.
 You are not doing a translation exercise. You won't understand every word. Get a main idea, a feeling, a mental picture first.
 Underline, put a question mark if you want to check something later, or an exclamation mark if something catches your attention. Later you can go back and check new words or ask a question.
 Don't worry about grammar, just write your ideas.
 In class, ask other students and participate in class discussions. Do any work sheets given by the teacher.
 In a class, you may have a reading schedule. If not, give yourself 2-3 months, and try to read the same amount every week. Keep a reading journal, with ideas after each chapter.
 Even if it's an old movie, it will help you visualize the story.
 Think about what the author had to do to create such a piece of writing for you to enjoy.
