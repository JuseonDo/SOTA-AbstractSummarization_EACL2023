Just sitting on the ball is one of the foundations for learning how to use an exercise ball for beginners.
,


If you have towels bracing the ball, scoot your behind forward until your lower back rests on the ball, then walk your feet forward until your thighs are parallel to the floor.
Your body should make a straight line from your knees to the top of your head.
 Do not sit up all the way; You just want to flex the space between the top of your hips and your rib cage.
 Repeat the sit-up at least 10 times.
