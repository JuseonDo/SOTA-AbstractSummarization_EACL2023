Products like grains, seeds and nuts are often far cheaper when
you're buying them in bulk.
Make sure you calculate the savings on other products.;

Talking to the farmer. You may be able to get a lower price if you buy in bulk or plan on buying from him or her on a consistent basis.
 Co-ops are stocked with a wide variety of natural, organic and local foods.
In addition, many co-ops have hot natural food prepared that you can get for lunch or bring home for dinner.

You pay a fee up front for the growing season and often a small fee on a weekly or monthly basis.
Prices are generally far less than buying from a grocery store. Consumers receive a box on a weekly basis filled with whatever produce the farmer has harvested that week.

For example, if it's strawberry season it might benefit you to buy a large quantity at a lower price and freeze the excess.

The money you'll save from not buying a mainstream brand is sometimes dramatic.

Many online stores and distributors are making natural dried foods available for purchase.
You often end up paying less if it is in bulk and, depending on where you purchase the products from, you may not have to pay sales tax. An online search should yield many results.

When a product is labeled "natural" it doesn't necessarily mean it is free from pesticides and preservatives.
Be sure you're buying foods that have a short list of ingredients.
In general, the more ingredients on the list, the more chemicals and other unnatural ingredients the product has. Look for organic ingredients to be sure you're buying quality food.
