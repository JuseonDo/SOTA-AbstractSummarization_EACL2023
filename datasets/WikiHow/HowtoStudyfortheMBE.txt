answer everything, on practice tests and the real thing: you are going to get scaled out of the all 190 (remember there are 10 pretest questions), so leaving an answer choice blank won't help.

 One of the single most important things to help you prepare for the MBE is to practice, practice, practice. And the only way to do that is to get practice questions. You can do this by purchasing commercial books and/or finding an online review program that has practice questions. Or, you can purchase them online on the National Conference of Bar Examiners website.;
, Treat it like the real thing so you can time yourself.
 Even if you get a question right on a practice test, read why it was right and why the other choices were wrong. If you got it wrong, read the right answer explanation and the wrong answer choices explanations.
 The answer choices are short, memorizing will go a long way.
 If your jurisdiction has a lot of distinctions (i.e, New York) it is easy to get confused. Make sure to highlight or find another way to clearly indicate what rules apply to what.
 Although by making them you can word things how you want, it might not be the most efficient use of time.
, Did I say that, well good, then go practice.
