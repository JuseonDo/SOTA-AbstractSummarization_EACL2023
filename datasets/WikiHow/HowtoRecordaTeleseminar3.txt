 Even if you're recording your teleseminar yourself, you will need an audio bridge that will allow other people to call in to your presentation.
 If you are using an inexpensive microphone, look into using a screen. This could be a polystyrene sleeve that fits over the microphone or is a physical screen that connects to the base of the microphone and covers the front of the unit.



Some hosting companies provide an online audio feed. To record that most audio programs will allow you to select that audio line to record. It's usually called "Line In." If you can only call in by phone, you should look into setting up a microphone that can record a speaker phone feed.
