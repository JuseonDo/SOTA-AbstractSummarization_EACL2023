,,, Erase the numbers, and put in your the numbers of people you want to be able to unsilence your phone during emergencies.
 Just be sure not to go over the character/text message limit, which is usually 140 or 160 characters. Tasker won't split the message in half. Be sure to put in only reply with the code if it is an emergency.
, Unless you want to change the keyword for unsilencing. If you want to change the keyword follow these steps:


Find the file un-silence.prf.xml and open it.






Search for "wakeupcall". Once you find that, change "wakeupcall" to whatever keyword you would like.






Then save this file.
