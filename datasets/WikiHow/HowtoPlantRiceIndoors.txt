 These types of rice are best for planting because they were nearly or never touched by machines and chemicals. Do not use white rice; it will never grow because it was highly processed.;
, (These are self-sealing bags.)

, These will serve as your sprouting pot(s).
, When the rice plants have sprouted stems, relocate them to a bucket, or a large waterproof container.
 Rice plants thrive in wet and warm conditions.
 Keep two inches of standing water in the bucket.
 At first the rice will be green but will eventually turn golden brown. Once it does, it's time to harvest.
 This will enable you to plant more next year.
