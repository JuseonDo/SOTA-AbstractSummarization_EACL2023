@summary
know the difference between liquid and dry measures, and use the appropriate one for each task.

@summary
use a liquid measure for liquids, such as water, milk or oil.

@summary
use a dry measure for powders, such as sugar, salt, and baking powder.

@summary
measure a liquid in a measuring spoon by filling it full.

@summary
,

@summary
use measuring spoons for dry ingredients by filling and then leveling with the straight edge of a spatula or knife.

@summary
measure a "heaping" or "rounded" tablespoon, teaspoon, or (less frequently) cup.

@summary
measure a "scant" cup or spoon by filling the measure not completely full, or by shaking or pouring a little bit out.

@summary
add measurements if you don't have a measure that size.

 While they hold the same volume, they are used differently. Measurements are labeled on each measure.;
, Fill the cup to the appropriate line, place it on a level surface, and read it with your eye at the level of the liquid. Water surface curves downward, so use the bottom of the curve for accurate measurement and not the edge that is against the measuring cup. This is helpful for bread recipes in which the exact amount of water is crucial.
 Spoon or scoop the powder lightly into the cup. Run a knife or spatula across the top to level the surface and scrape any excess back into the jar or canister.
, Many baking powder cans come with a built-in edge for leveling. In a pinch, you can also use the edge of the lid.
 This quantity is not so precise, but it is generally a moderately sized, round mound, or heap of the dry ingredient in addition to that which fills the spoon.
 Again, this is an imprecise measurement.
 For instance, 1 3/4 teaspoons is 1 teaspoon plus 1/2 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon.
