@article
 Set up a Barbie house or doll house, or just improvise. Have Barbie spend a day doing house things, from watching TV to doing the dishes. Also she could have a big grand dinner and all her besties could come over and have dinner and then sit down and watch a movie, or you could put on old Barbie clothes and she could have a clean out day and she can tidy up her house.;
, Have her study. She could even hold a study group. If she does hold a study group make sure her besties are in it!!!

, You could turn the barbie venue into a sleepover den for her and get popcorn and Barbie pjs
