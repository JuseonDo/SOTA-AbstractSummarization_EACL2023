, Windows Vista will ask if you want to run it, and it will also say that there are compatibility issues with the game. Dismiss this info, and just click cancel.
 Right click on the CD/DVD drive icon (it should say something like Quake4TM).
 Click Open or Explore.
 Double click it.
 Do all is says to do.
 If you have the standard Quake 4, with 4 discs, inserts the next disc when the program tells you to. A small window will pop asking if you want to run the disc, this time, you should accept. Do this for the rest of the 3 discs. If you are using the DVD version of Quake 4, you will only need to use the one DVD. (I think so, I am not sure the DVD version comes with 1 or 2 DVDs).
