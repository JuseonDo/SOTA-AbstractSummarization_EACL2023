 It might be later or earlier than you get up at other times of year.;
, This will give your body enough time to wake up and warm up.
 You may find a warm shower more useful for waking you up in winter than other times of the year.
 If you didn't already lay out your clothes the night before, pick them out now. You might need to do this other times of year but make sure you have the correct technique for doing this in the winter.
 No one is happy on an empty stomach in the morning in winter!

, Apple Cider first thing on a Winter morning is not for everyone , especially drivers.
