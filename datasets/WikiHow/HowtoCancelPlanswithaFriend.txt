 The best way to avoid inconveniencing your friend is to give them plenty of time to make an alternate plan. Most resentment comes from cancelling at the last minute, when friends have already changed their day to accommodate your plans., Reaching a person directly is essential when cancelling friends, so that no time is wasted. If they don’t answer, leave a message and follow up with a text or email.
 Friends can often tell when someone’s not being honest, so tell the truth whenever possible to avoid the knock-on effects of little white lies.Sometimes, you may need to tell a little lie. For example, if you’re having bladder problems or you’ve learned that the person’s ex-boyfriend will be at the occasion, you may want to spare your friend a reaction. Leave those lies for times when you really need them. In most cases, you can come clean later and your friend will understand.
 Be sincere, and recognize that someone has blocked out time for you and you may be wasting their valuable time.You needn’t apologize more than once or twice unless you feel the message has not been delivered.
 If you leave them with extra tickets, take the burden to find someone else to buy them.
 Your friend won’t feel as though you are trying to avoid them and you can choose a time that is convenient for both of you.
 Relationships become strained when one party starts cancelling with regularity. A cancellation is more likely to be fine if it’s only done on very rare occasions.
 Suggest several times that will definitely work for you.
, For example, if you need to cancel lunch plans, you might suggest that you’ll take them out at their favorite lunch place or cook them lunch soon.
 If they seem put-off, they may be hurt by your cancellation. It may take time and several un-cancelled plans to build up trust again.
