@article
 If he is in a relationship or dating somebody, don't be afraid to still talk to him. Flirt with him subtly; if you do it properly then he will subconsciously flirt with you back.;
, Hold eye contact with him, smile, touch his arm while laughing, be assertive. Don't be afraid to make the first move.
 It shows you're interested and you want to get to know him. Don't be too pushy, but slip in the occasional 'what is your opinion on that?' 'Do you like this/that?' It makes a difference.
 It will show you're confident and keen.
,,,, If the date is awkward and you decide you don't like him, tell him you should just remain as friends. If you still like him, but you're convinced he doesn't like you back then play it down - don't communicate as much for about a week and then start flirting again.
