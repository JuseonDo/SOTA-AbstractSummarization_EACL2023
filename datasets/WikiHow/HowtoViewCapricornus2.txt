 When gazing up at the sky, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the number of stars. Narrow your view to just the stars you can see when facing south. This southern sky is where you will find the sea goat, Capricornus., The direction of the Capricornus also changes if you live in the southern hemisphere. In this case, you would look to the northern sky, not the southern sky. Again, it helps to ignore the rest of the sky if you are looking for just one constellation., The sea is in the southern portion of the sky (northern from the southern hemisphere). It is home to several water-related constellations, such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Cetus. Knowing this area and these constellations can help you find Capricornus.If you are familiar with the Summer Triangle constellation, you can draw a straight line from one of it’s points (the star Vega), through a second point (the star Altair) and straight to Capricornus.
