 Use the entire contents of a 3 oz. (85 g) box of any flavor dessert gelatin.;
, Measure the water exactly.
 This will take about 2 minutes. A fork, whisk, or rubber spatula is recommended for mixing the powder and boiling water.
 Measure the amount exactly.
 This will take approximately 90 minutes, and the gelatin will have the consistency of unbeaten egg whites.
 Add 3/4 cup to 1 1/2 cups (110 g to 226 g) of chopped fruit.


Take care not to add extra liquid with the fruit. This could prevent the gelatin from setting (becoming firm), resulting in a runny dessert dish. Drain all juice or syrup if using canned fruit, and use a paper towel to blot dry all fruit.
Defrost frozen fruits before mixing them into gelatin.
Avoid adding certain fresh or frozen fruits. Figs, ginger root, guava, kiwifruit, papaya and pineapple will prevent the gelatin from setting. However, you can add canned versions of these fruits or put them on top of completely set gelatin as a garnish.
 This will take about 4 hours.
