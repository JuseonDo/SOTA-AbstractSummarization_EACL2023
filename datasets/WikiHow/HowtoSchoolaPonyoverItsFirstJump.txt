 Place these next to some jump wings, in readiness for use as the poles get raised with growth in the pony's confidence.;
,, Get your pony on the bit.
,, Repeat until your pony is confident and going over without hesitation.


Be prepared for anything. Keep your leg on and look ahead.
 Repeat the walk, trot, canter over it until the pony is confident with each approach.
 Then walk up to the jump and let your pony look at it, to become familiar with what it will shortly jump.
 Your pony may hesitate but speak softly to encourage and reassure it that what you are doing is okay. Be prepared for it to leap or stop.
 Always remember that this is scary for your pony––it's new and daunting. Anything could happen and it's as if you're suddenly jumping off the monkey bars––you'd hesitate and find it scary at first too.
 Give it a few more tries jumping fillers and coloured poles.


Keep the jump on cross poles but change the height. Do not try spreads or combinations yet, as your pony is not used to having to stride and pace itself at this stage.
 Pat your pony and praising it. Always cool down effectively, on a long rein.
 Give it a treat, acknowledging that the pony did a brave thing for you. However the exercise went, the pony still tried to please you.
