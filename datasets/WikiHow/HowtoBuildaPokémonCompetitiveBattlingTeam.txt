,, For example, if you have a Pokémon that has a high Attack stat, you may want to give them an Adamant nature to raise their Attack and lower their Special Attack.
 You can change this later.
 Does it have all attacking moves? You may want to remove a move and put in a stat boosting move that raises your Pokémon's highest attack stat (Attack or Special Attack). Swords Dance will double your Pokémon's Attack stat, while Nasty Plot will double Special Attack.
 Ideally, for a 4 Pokémon tournament team, you need two leads, a special attacker, and a physical attacker.
 Replace stat-boosting moves on your lead(s) with moves like Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock. These damage your opponent's Pokémon when they switch in.
 In addition to a stat boosting move, they should fill their other move slots with moves of three different types that complement the Pokémon's weaknesses. Make sure that these moves are either all Special or all Physical (if you have a stat boosting move; however, you could have a mixed attacker).
 The Focus Sash is a good item to put on your leads, while the Life Orb and Choice Band/Scarf/Specs. The Choice items raise Attack, Speed, and Special Attack, respectively. If you choose to use these, do not put a stat boosting move on your Pokémon. The Choice items allow for your Pokémon to use only one move until you switch them out or lose the item.
