first of all, get a good lubricant: vitamin e oil (jar or pill form), jojoba oil, olive oil, or emu oil are commonly used.

 This assures a smooth painless insertion of jewelry. Do not, under ANY circumstances, use Vaseline.;

,, Careful! We don't want to tear it. Be aware as this is where most blowouts occur; the fistula is being pushed out to the opposite side of insertion. If a blowout does happen to appear at any point of tapering, an upgrade to taping may be the way to go. If you don't want to do the taping method, you must downsize to the size that you were beforehand.
 is clean and at hand. (Autoclave is the safest way because the micro tears in your skin make you vulnerable to microbes.) Do not leave tapers in for any amount of time as it will result in uneven weight distribution, greatly increasing the chances of a blowout.
,, Listen to your body. While some discomfort is expected and a mild stinging, it should be easy, not painful.
 Allow plenty of time to heal properly with warm saline solution (or sea salt soak) twice daily then follow with oil massages, and wait before you stretch again. Apart from listening to your body, this is the next best thing you can do. Bleeding stretches are a sign of tearing somewhere in the fistula; if not healed properly, this can create a blowout during future stretches.
