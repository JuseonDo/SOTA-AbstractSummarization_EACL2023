,,,, (Optional). Answering these questions will help CafePress recommend the best account type for your specific needs.
, CafePress offers three kinds of shops: Basic, CafePress and Premium. Basic and Premium Shops let you set your own price as a markup over the base price CafePress sets for each item, while CafePress sets the sale price for items you sell in a CafePress shop.


Basic Shops are free, and you can set up as many as you want, but you're limited to selling only 1 product in each shop. You can, however, promote your shop in the CafePress Marketplace, and CafePress does provide other promotional tools to help you promote your shop.
CafePress Shops are also free, but CafePress determines the retail prices for items in your shop; you get a 10 percent commission on each sale. The range of products you can choose to sell is more limited than in a Basic Shop, and you're not eligible to receive a performance bonus or to be listed in the CafePress Marketplace. (This feature, an adaptation of the CafePress Marketplace, is currently in beta version.)
Premium Shops charge a monthly, quarterly or annual fee for the shop; however, you can choose to sell any of the products CafePress offers and different products from the same shop. You also have a choice of pre-made designs for your storefront or the ability to create your own design, as well as the ability to organize your products in categories.
 This will used as the ending of your shop’s URL. For example, http://www.cafepress.com/ShopID.
 Enter the name exactly as you want it to appear on your shop.
 By default they will be directed back to the shop front page. (Optional)
