 Act respectfully, responsibly, and do not be loud. Most teachers hate that.;
,, You can take part and be active in the classroom by volunteering answers and raising your hand when the teacher asks the class a question to see if you were listening. Do not be afraid to ask questions if you are confused. It does not make you look dumb, it shows the teacher that you were listening and want to learn.
 Write down the things you want to remember, and the important main ideas. Do not write down every single word the teacher says. Write neatly and put the date so you can easily review your notes later.
 The language teacher will like it if you use your French skills and mix it with your accent. Listen to how the teacher pronounces words.
 Some teachers like a student that will progress, not one that stays at the top all the time and answers every question, stripping other classmates of opportunities to learn.
 Any person that learns a second language knows that accent marks are a pain. Do not stress over where an accent mark goes, just try to see correlations between how a syllable is pronounced, and the accent effecting its pronunciation. Once you make the sound-accent connection, accents are not difficult.
 If you know the stuff pretty well, studying may not be a huge responsibility, but you should review daily. If you do not know your material, step it up in class.
 Help them and ask to be helped, you might even make friends.
, Not only is this essential to getting good grades, it will give you practice and help you understand the material better.
 This will help your brain remember the things you learned. Study even if there isn't a quiz or test coming up. Read in a textbook, review your notes, use any study guides you have.
 This will help you SO much.
 Ask them questions if you are confused, and ask them how your accent is and how you can improve.
