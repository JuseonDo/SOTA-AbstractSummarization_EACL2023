,, Mix by hand until the mixture forms crumbs.
 Stir to coat in flour.
 Add the treacle and stir thoroughly.
, Top with a greased layer of kitchen foil.
 Then tie string around the bowl to form lifting handles.



If you don't have a steamer, make one from a dish or pan larger than the pudding basin and fill to halfway of the basin with boiling water. This will need to be put into the oven and steamed at around 180ºC/350ºF.
 Check every quarter hour or so for the water level; if needed, top up with more boiling water. (Be very careful when doing this.)

, Undo the cover and tip the pudding out onto a serving plate.


The serving plate should be warmed before adding the pudding to it.
 This pudding can be served with whipped cream, ice cream, ginger syrup or other tasty choices.
