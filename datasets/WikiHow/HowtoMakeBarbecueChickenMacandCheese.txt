 Place the chicken breast into a large bowl and sprinkle about ¼ cup of baking soda on it. Then pour about a cup of vinegar into the bowl and mix it all up.;
,, Take the chicken from the bowl and put it onto your cutting board. Using the large knife, cut the chicken into little strips, then take the chicken strips and cut them into cubes. The cubes should be roughly around one inch in size.
 Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. You can also add other seasonings that you may want.
 Turn the stove on low heat. The low heat is to prevent the oil from getting too hot and start popping.


Make sure to heat the olive oil until it is less thick and flows easily. This ensures that it is hot enough to cook the chicken.
If the oil starts popping, it's because it is too hot when you add the chicken. Immediately take the chicken off of the stove and lower the heat. Put the chicken back on once the oil has had a chance to cool down a bit.
 Using a wooden spoon, constantly stir the chicken in the pan. Cook until the chicken has become golden brown on the outside.
 Add ¼ cup barbecue sauce to chicken.,, Set the heat to medium-high.
 After the water has reached a boil, add the macaroni. You know the water is boiling once it is bubbling over.
 Constantly stir the macaroni so it won’t stick to the bottom of the pot and so the water will not bubble over the pot.
 It is important not to overcook the macaroni so it still is a bit firm.
 Mix these together on the lowest heat.


This recipe uses olive oil instead of butter here because it is a bit healthier. However, if you wanted to use butter, then use one tablespoon of butter in place of the olive oil.
 Keep the heat on to melt the shredded cheese after adding it. Keep stirring to distribute the cheese throughout the macaroni mix.
 Add the barbecue chicken to the mix and stir it up.
 Add hot sauce if desired.
