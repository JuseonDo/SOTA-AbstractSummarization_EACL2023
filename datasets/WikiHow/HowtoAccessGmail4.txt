 First, you will need to set up Gmail to allow connections from other programs.
,, Gmail recommends using IMAP so you can check your Gmail more than one location. This is helpful if you use a mail client but also want the ability to use the web interface or mobile app if necessary.


Another option is POP. Select “Enable POP for all mail” if you don’t want to save copies of your Gmail messages on Gmail’s server. When your e-mail client retrieves messages through POP, the messages on the Gmail server will be deleted.
 You will find this link under POP or IMAP (whichever service you chose). This will launch Google’s official support page that contains up-to-date server addresses that you’ll need to input into your e-mail app.


Some clients may not require this information, but you should open it just in case.
 The location is different depending on your mail client.

Follow the prompts to start receiving your Gmail on your Mac.
 This is where you’ll configure your Gmail settings.


Select “Add New Account,” then select “IMAP” or “POP” from the options, depending on what you chose previously. Click “Next” to proceed.
Enter the information from the “Configuration Instructions” into the appropriate blanks.
