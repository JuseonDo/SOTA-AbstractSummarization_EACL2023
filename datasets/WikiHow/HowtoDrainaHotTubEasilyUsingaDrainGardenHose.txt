@summary
connect the hose to the water bib (that's the faucet on the side of your house).

@summary
once you've got flow into the tub, turn off the water at the hose bibb.

@summary
bend a kink into the hose a couple feet below the connection to the hose bibb.

@summary
disconnect the hose from the faucet.

@summary
once you've got the end you're holding (still kinked) below the level of the hot tub, and you're in your pre-selected location for where you want the water to go, let the end of the hose un-kink.

@summary
remove the water.

 Put the open end into the hot tub, and start filling the hot tub. The idea here is to fill the hose with water completely, with minimal air bubbles in the line.;
, Keep the hose end in the hot tub submerged, or you'll have to refill the hose with water!

, This seals the water inside the hose, more or less.
 You'll have to hold the kink in the hose until you get the tail end (the end you're holding) below the level of the hot tub. This is where gravity comes into play.
 The water will start flowing. You've just created a siphon!


Water "seeks it's own level", which is how this system works. The water pressure in the hot tub essentially pushes the water out the hose, because the open end of the hose is lower than the level of the water in the hot tub. Yes, the water has to go up and over the edge of the tub, but here's the neat part––because the hose was full of water, the water inside the hose creates suction at the end inside the tub, which pulls the water over the edge, and flows down the line.
 Wipe down and dry the hot tub and store/cover as suggested by the manufacturer.
