@summary
finally, you should put your key back in and switch on your windscreen wipers once to put them back to their resting position if you had to follow step 2.

@article
 The wiper arm is fitted with a spring, so only a small amount of force is required. When fully extended, they will stay away from the screen until you push them back. If the car's bonnet is in the way and prevents the wiper from being lifted all the way up, proceed to step 2.;
, If your windscreen wipers cannot be raised all the way up, rest them down again as normal, jump in the car, turn the key to the first or second position, and then operate the windscreen wipers (you normally do not need the engine running for this). When the wipers are at around a 45 degree angle (pictured), quickly turn the key to the off position so that the wipers stop half-way through their motion. You should now be able to pull the windscreen wipers away from the screen fully.
 Pinch the serrated tabs (both sides of the wiper), and at the same time pull the wiper in the direction indicated by the red arrow. The wiper should pull away from the wiper arm (shown in the next step).
 You may have to rock the wiper slightly as there is a small catch at the top, but no force is required.
 You're Half-way there. Make a cup of tea, go on - CELEBRATE!Â :)

, Remove the clip from the windscreen wiper. To do this, grip the clip as indicated by the red arrows. Push the square tab situated between your fingers down, and then pull in the direction of the blue arrow. NOTE: The image shows the clip partially removed already. The square tab has already been pushed down to allow the clip to slide.
, Simply align the new blade with the wiper arm. The tab on the wiper arm marked with a red arrow pushes the flap marked with the blue arrow down, and then secures into place (as shown in the next step).
 The clips you are squeezing will lock the wiper blade into place.
 All that remains is to set the windscreen wiper back down to the windscreen. Just gently push the wiper blade, being careful to support it all the way back down.
