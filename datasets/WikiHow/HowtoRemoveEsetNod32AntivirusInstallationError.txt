 In order to start logging follow these steps:
Open the registry editor (Start – Run – type ‘regedit’ (without quotation marks) and confirm OK)






Find the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\LogLevel and set the value to 0x0000FFFF hexadecimal






Exit the registry editor







, Say for instance (C:\ess_nt32_ENU.msi /lvx* install.log)






This will create an installation log with useful information in case of failure of an installation process. Finally, locate the log files install.log and C:\Windows\setupapi.log and send those files using the online form at http://www.eset.eu/support/form.
