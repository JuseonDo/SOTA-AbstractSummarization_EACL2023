 It should ideally be on level ground.


Dig a shallow hole for your first block's location. Use a hand tamper to make the soil level and compact. Add 2 or 3 inches (5 or 7.5 cm) of gravel to the hole.
Set a 4-inch-thick (10 cm) concrete block into the hole. The gravel will help prevent any rainwater that could run under the shed from washing away loose soil.
Continue placing 4-inch (10 cm) concrete blocks in this manner in evenly spaced, straight rows. The number of blocks you need and their spacing depends on your shed's dimensions.
Stack 2-inch-thick (5 cm) blocks on top of the initial concrete blocks to level the foundation as necessary.
 The number and length of pieces you will need depends on your shed's dimensions. The 2 by 4-inch (5 by 10 cm) measurements refer to each board's width and depth., Each frame should have a slanted top and a center board as a crosspiece. Assemble the frames with 3-inch (7.5 cm) deck screws., They should stand vertical and be spaced next to each other like a series of partitions., Nail the boards along the fronts and backs of the frames., The doors will be placed under the lower side of the shed's slanted roof.,, Add an extra 3/4 of an inch (1.9 cm) to your floor measurements to let the plywood line up against the 1 by 2 (2.5 by 5 cm) boards., Screw the plywood into place., Screw them into position. The crosspieces will support shelving in the shed., Secure the shelves inside the shed with screws., Use boards with tongues and grooves in them to lock them into place more easily., Use 1 5/8-inch ring-shank siding nails. Apply constructive adhesive to better secure the cedar planks to the framing if necessary.,, Nail more tongue-and-groove cedar boards to the angled top of the frame. Let the cedar roof hang down the sides and front of the shed., The height of the doors should reach the bottom edge of the 2 by 6 (5 by 15 cm) header board.,, Use strong hinges to attach the doors to the shed.
