 Before the race even starts, you should have an, "I will do well," mindset. If you don't think you will do well you won't do well.;
, Once you can see the finish line, you should be running all out. Don't worry about coming up short. It's better to try to fail than to never try at all.
 You can tell if someone's behind you by listening to their breathing and footsteps. Looking back will only slow you down. Instead, think, "this person isn't beating me," and run as fast as your legs will carry you.
 Try to catch up to them anyway. While you may not win, it will improve your time and keep others from passing you. Have that same, "this person isn't beating me," mindset and run as fast as your legs will carry you.
 The officials usually stop the clock as the runner's chest passes the finish line, not their legs, as it would be harder to tell who won in a close call. This could make the difference between 1st and 2nd place. (See the picture of the bunny.) Do this in races that donÂ´t use time chips. When you are in a race that uses time chips thrust the foot that has the time chip first to lose some extra milliseconds.
, If you have another event, go to that event.
 If you felt like you had energy to do another lap at the end, you should have probably kicked sooner. But, if you are exhausted and feel pushed to your limit, you probably kicked at the right time.
