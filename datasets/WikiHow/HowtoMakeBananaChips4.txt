 Pour in water to cover, then bring to the boil for 10 minutes.
 Let cool.
 Slice thinly. Make sure that the slices are even, to avoid uneven microwaving.
 Season to taste with salt.
 Keep in a single layer and don't allow the slices to touch.
 Microwave on high for 8 minutes.


Every two minutes, stop the cooking, remove the plate and flip the slices over. This ensures even cooking on both sides.
Be extra vigilant in the final two minutes, to avoid burning the banana chips.
 Let cool and the banana chips will crisp up.
 Arrange in a small bowl. To keep, place in an airtight container.
