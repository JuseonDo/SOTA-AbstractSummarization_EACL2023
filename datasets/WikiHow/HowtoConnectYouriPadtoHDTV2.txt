 Make sure that you have an active Wi-Fi connection and that your devices can connect and surf the net. Apple TV allows you to connect your iPad to your HDTV wirelessly using your Wi-Fi Internet.


You can purchase Apple TV through Apple’s website or any Apple Store near you.
 Open the box, and plug the HDMI cable that comes with the Apple TV to its HDMI port. Plug the other end of the HDMI cable to the HDMI port on your TV.
 Do so by switching on your TV and adjusting the video settings so that the display comes from the HDMI port your Apple TV is currently plugged to.
 Switch it on by pressing its Power button at the back.
 Use the Apple TV’s remote to adjust the settings and connect it to your Wi-Fi network.
, Afterwards, swipe the multitasking tab at the bottom of the screen to the media control buttons.
 This is the small button right beside the iPad controls (beside the Forward button).
, Your iPad’s screen will now be displayed on your HDTV’s screen!
