 It should look like a door, but make it relatively small on your paper, since you still need to add shapes of the other dominoes.;
, This will give your domino depth, make it look more three-dimensional than it did before.
 Simply repeat the first two steps of the process, but overlap each domino that you add to the one before it.
 Make it look as though it's pressing against the last domino you drew, trying to push it away.
 This domino should be slanting even more steeply, however, nearly parallel to the ground.
 Remember, they go from zero to six. Also remember to draw the dividing line in the middle.
 Use a contrasting color for the details.
