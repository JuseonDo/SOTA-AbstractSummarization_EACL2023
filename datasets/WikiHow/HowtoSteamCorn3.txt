, If you have not yet done so, husk the corn and pull away any threads or strings. Rinse the corn, then chop off any bad spots. Cut the corn in half when you are done.
 Do not grease the baking dish.
 Do not add any salt to the water, or it will make the corn tough.
 As the water heats up, it will steam the corn., Cut the butter into cubes first, then melt it in the microwave or in a small saucepan over the stove. Stir in the parsley and salt, then set it aside.


The parsley is optional, but it will give the corn more flavor.
 You can also use a pair of tongs to transfer the corn from the baking dish to your serving platter.
 Use a pair of tongs to turn the corn cobs around in the baking dish. This will help the butter coat them evenly.
