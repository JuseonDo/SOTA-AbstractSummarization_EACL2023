 You are only able to deduct the mileage and usage for your business purposes. Your personal use cannot be deducted.



Find the amount you may deduct for things such as utilities, advertising and office supplies in your first year of business. The maximum you can deduct is currently $5,000, but the law may change (for example, in 2010 the maximum was $10,000).
 These are deductible if the lawyers, tax professionals or other consultants you hire are performing work for the current filing year.
 When a customer does not pay for a product you sell, you can write off the debt as a tax exemption. This does not apply to a small business that provides services.
 You can deduct up to 50 percent of your entertaining costs if you paid to feed or entertain current or potential clients.
 All of the travel costs, including airfare, taxis and meals can be deducted when the purpose of travel was for business.
 If your small business purchases a new asset, you can either write off the full cost of the equipment the year you buy it, or capitalize it over several years.


Talk to your tax professional about which deduction is best. You may also need help determining whether your asset qualifies. For example, inventory purchased for resale and real estate are not tax deductible.
 Some software can be deducted in the year it was purchased, or it has to be depreciated over 3 years.
 If your small business gives money or equipment that has not been depreciated to charity, you can deduct that contribution.
 Eligible taxes include fuel tax, sales tax, employment tax real estate taxes.
