To get these, you first must smash a Shadow Orb (if you have a Corruption world) or Crimson Heart (if you have a Crimson world).;
, Each day after the aforementioned step, the Goblin Army has a small chance of occurring. The event isn't very hard to beat, but do this before it happens:

When the Goblin Army attacks, lead them away from your house and NPCs. Although they aren't as dangerous as other armies, such as Lunar, Pumpkin Moon, or Pirate Armies, they still can spawn in your house, destroying things and killing NPCs.
Prepare potions and weapons. As most Goblins in the Goblin Army use swords and other melee weapons, use ranged weapons to combat them. E.g., bows, guns, blowguns, etc.
, Look for a bound goblin.

Right clicking on him will free him, giving you the Goblin Tinkerer NPC.
From him, you can buy both the Rocket Boots for 5 gold and the Tinkerer's Workshop for 10 gold.
,

Underground Cabins are mini-uninhabited homes found in different underground biomes.
In the standard Underground Biome, you can find the Hermes Boots.
In an Underground Tundra or Snow Biome, you can find the Flurry Boots.


Any of these can be used in the recipe.


Make sure the Rocket Boots and the set you found aren't equipped as accessories.
 You can either equip them or store them until they're next needed.,

The Aglet can be found easily by exploring Forest Chests on the Surface. If you can't find one, you have a chance of getting it from a wooden crate while fishing.
The Anklet, however, requires more exploration. You can find one in the Underground Jungle Biome, inside of a Jungle Shrine or in a Jungle Crate (fished up only in a Surface Jungle Biome).
,

They can be found randomly in the Underground Tundra or Snow Biome. Look in every Ice Chest you can find, as they contain the boots.
, Now you have the Frostspark Boots. Equip them and enjoy.
