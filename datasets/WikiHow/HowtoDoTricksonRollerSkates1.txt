 These skills are important because you have to glide for a little before you can jump, and then you are continuing with your glide. Also, if you don't land just right, you will fall, and if you don't fall correctly you could end up breaking a bone.
 Since you have mastered the basics of skating, it might seem embarrassing or unneeded to go to the wall again, but it will help you later. Hold onto the ledge of the wall, push up so that your feet are off the ground, and then let go and go slightly backwards. You should land with your legs slightly bent and your arms at your sides, barely raised. You might want a friend behind you to stop you from rolling backwards. This simulated landing after the jump. Do this many times until you are comfortable with it., Take a few powerful strokes and then glide. Bend your knees and get your feet as close together as you can. Now jump straight up. Your momentum will carry you forward., You must get ready to land, so straighten your body, with little weight forward. Keep your knees bend, but them behind you. This will help you from going too far forward., Make sure to keep your leg slightly bent. This is very important because if you don't, you could hit the floor the wrong way and off balance and break a bone., Make sure you keep your glide going because it makes the jump look smooth, even though it already happened. You will understand if you see someone else jump.
