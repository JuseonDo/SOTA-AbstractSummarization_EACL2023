 For example, you might like fantasy and action and hate educational and literary apps. Remember, each person's likes and dislikes are different and just because your neighbor likes one game doesn't mean you will like it too.
 There will probably be hundreds of apps ( paid and free ). There will be a column of top free games and top paid games. Free games are fine, but paid games offer more features and fun too.

It is not recommended to buy paid games which again have in-app purchases. There are some apps which have no worth in buying the in-app purchases.
 Remember, your eye power can increase and you might get distracted .



There are some games which are multiples of each other. In these types of games, buy only one. Don't buy ten of them, because at the end of the day, they are all based on the same concept.
