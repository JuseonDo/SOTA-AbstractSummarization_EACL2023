 Use manners and speak nicely and not to loud or too fast. When your mother or father says to make your bed you do it, after you do it you should feel better and so will your parents!;
, Don't be too messy, be organized, sort your stuff out. Maybe go shopping and buy new stuff you don't have but really need. Paint your walls a lovely plain colour like white, light blue, light purple or pink (happy colours not emo, Gothic, dark depressing colours) put a painting on the wall instead of poster.
 Moisturise your body every day to have clean healthy skin!

, Eat 7 veggies and 2 pieces of fruit, it's yummy and healthy! Do some dancing, yoga or something smoothing and calming! And drink 8 glasses of water a day to give you energy to play, have fun, and look good!

,, Write the price and save up.
, If there are others waiting to take one, be speedy! But always make sure you are clean.
