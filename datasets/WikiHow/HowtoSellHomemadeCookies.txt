  Be careful not to eat all your merchandise, too.;
,  You can throw them away, eat them with your family, or give them away as free samples. You could also donate them to a food bank or food collection if you are into helping people. Plus, then you can say that you donate food. It's a good advertising campaign.
  Make sure they are arranged in a visually-pleasing way. You could have them in neat stacks, or spiraling around the jar, or if you're creative, you could use food coloring and dye the cookies complementary colors and alternate those. Also be careful of crushing the cookies.
 Be sure to think about people with allergies. If you put peanut butter in all of your cookies, but don't tell the person, they could have an allergic reaction and possibly die from anaphylaxis shock.
  Be willing to go a little bit lower to please a tough customer, but don't go too low or you'll eat up your profit. For example, 1 chocolate chip cookie could be $1.00, an oatmeal raisin cookie could be $1.75 or maybe a $1.50. You get the idea.
