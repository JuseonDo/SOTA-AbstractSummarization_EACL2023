 If they are leather or suede, this is the gentlest method for drying them quickly. Hard-soled clogs should be dried with this newspaper method.
 Discard any pages with dark ink or pictures. The ink can sometimes bleed onto the shoes.


The ink can easily be buffed off on dark leather shoes.
If you are worried about ink damage, place them upside down in a box filled with one inch (2.5 cm) of rice. Close the box tightly and check them in 2 hours.
 You can also remove dirt with a damp dishcloth.
 Continue with each shoe until the entire insole is filled with balls of newspaper.
 String a rubber band around the midsection of the shoe so that the newspaper will stay.
, If your shoes were soaked, the newspaper will need to be changed several times.
