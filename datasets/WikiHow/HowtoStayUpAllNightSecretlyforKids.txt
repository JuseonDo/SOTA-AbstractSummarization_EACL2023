 You don't want to do this unprepared, unless you're a total night owl. To stay up all night, you need to have some things. If you're planning on sneaking around the house, make a map of your house. Test the floors, chairs, couch, and beds and mark out where things creak, shake, or make any noise when you move around. If you're afraid of the dark, plan out which areas you will avoid. You're almost ready to start. Get all your things and entertainment ready to go. Stuff it somewhere inconspicuous (like under your bed). Also, you will want to place a bucket of cold water or a wet cloth there too.;
, Go at your normal time, acting completely ordinary. You can't have them suspecting anything. If you have a computer, PlayStation, DS, Xbox, etc. in your room, it is a good idea to leave them on with the monitor off, because if you have to turn it on totally in the middle of the night your parents (even sleeping ones) will be woken by the sudden change in volume.
 This may take a long time, even more than an hour, but be determined to stay awake. Now, once your parents are asleep, it's time for you to have lots of fun!

, Don't leave your room. It'll pass time for a while. Get on the computer or something that will keep your brain active.
 When you find yourself closing your eyes, go as quietly as possible and put a cold rag on your face or splash water on your face. It feels awful but it will keep you awake.
 Use the map to quietly navigate your house to get food or electronics.
 Put another cold rag or splash water on your face and watch some TV or do extra homework.
