 New copies of games always mean more expensive prices. So consider buying used copies.;
, Doing this will help you not accidentally over spend more than you could really afford.
 Some popular game stores like Gamestop have a cheap Edge card that you could use to buy used pre-owned games and have a 10% discount, Thus saving you money in the process.
 You could save money and get more games for this.
 Many stores might offer some sort of special offer during special occasions and you could sometimes save a bundle.
 Sometimes your family members might be willing to buy you video games as a gift. This works best if you were still a preteen or young teen.
 Such as mowing lawns, Water someone's plants, walk someone's dogs or feed pets while the owners were gone. This will help you get the money you possibly need to get the game you want.
 Like if you are a PS3 or a Xbox 360 fan, consider buying the past generation games like PS2 and xbox games. Some very popular titles are not available for the current consoles and a lot of those games are dirt cheap as well.
 There's no point on buying the games you already knew you will not enjoy because then you'll ended wasting your money.
 One way to save money on games is to actually play them for a while before buying more.
 Many stores might be selling other games for a cheaper price so consider shopping at more than one location.
 If you are willing to share a game with someone, consider buying the game with someone and determine a proper timetable for you and your friends. Doing this will keep costs down.
 Most games will have sort sort of price drop after it's initial release. So consider buying them after it gets cheaper.
