 The top one should be a little smaller than the bottom circle, and the circles should overlap slightly.



 ;
, Draw a large circle directly behind and wider than the previous two circles to make up the upper section of Drizella’s hair. Also, draw two curved lines down and slightly outward from underneath the head for the neck.
 Make the top oval’s line curve into itself as shown to make it appropriately fluffy. For the lower section of the hair, draw a few curves on each side of the neck one on top of each other connecting them to the large circle drawn in the previous step.
 Put overlapping ovals on both sides near the top of the large circle. These side circles will form Drizella’s puffy dress sleeves.
 Draw two horizontal ovals connected to the first two, drawn inward toward the center of Drizella’s body. Connected to these ovals draw another pair of ovals, which should be angled upward for the hands.
 Over the waist, her hands should be held together with the fingers interlocked.
 Draw the facial features, the neckband, and the dress modifications as shown.
 Color in Drizella and your drawing is completely done!
