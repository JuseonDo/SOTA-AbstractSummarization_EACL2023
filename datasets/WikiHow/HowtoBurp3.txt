 Even if you perform this method incorrectly, a closed mouth will muffle the sound of an otherwise loud burp.
 Burps that escape through the nose are almost completely silent. This is because they don't vibrate the upper esophageal sphincter, like a mouth burp. The sound produced will be like that of a normal exhalation through the nose, though any odor may remain.


Try to have clear sinuses beforehand - otherwise, your burp will have nowhere to go.
 Doing this will help your burp be as subtle as possibleâ€” unless the scent causes you pass out.
 Covering your mouth with your hands or a closed fist will further muffle any sound from the burp. When you've made your burp, open your mouth to allow the gas to dissipate.


Pretending to yawn can be a great excuse to open your mouth. Just make sure you don't have any extra burps before you do it!
