 You need an ordinary duel-sided flat iron to curl your hair. A 1 inch (2.5 cm) iron will be perfect for the job. Just give it a minute or two to fully heat up.
 Sectioning your hair can help you isolate parts of your hair. This can make it a bit easier to curl your hair, especially if there's a lot of it, but it can take longer. If you're sectioning your hair, you'll need to clip or pin back the top part of your hair so you can reach the bottom strands first. If you're not, then you can start with any of your strands. As you curl more hair, you'll be sectioning less and less of it.
, Curl it forward gently, away from your face, leaving just a few inches at the bottom. Just turn the iron one time and pull it straight out. You can hold on to the end of the hair with your other hand for more control.
 Pick a strand that is next to the strand you just curled.
 Complete the same process you used for curling the strand forward, except turn the iron in the opposite direction this time.
 Alternating between curling a strand forward and backward will keep your curls from clumping together and will create a light, bouncy look. This method will make your hair a bit less curly than the pin curl or alternating curl method.
 Spraying your hair will hold the curls in place for longer.
