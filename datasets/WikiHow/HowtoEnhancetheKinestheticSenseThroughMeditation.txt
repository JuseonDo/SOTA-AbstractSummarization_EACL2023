 It can also be called kinesthesia. When you increase your bodies sense of its own movement, you can enhance the performance of the body in relative space and time.;
, The space must be a place you feel comfortable in and can completely relax into.You can meditate indoors, or outdoors whichever you prefer.
 Do not talk while you are stretching, try to clear your mind and bring yourself to the present.
 You may sit down on the ground or on a cushion, or chair if you have knee problems, what ever is available to you.
 The open upright palm position increases the bodies ability to listen and remain open to the world around and accept the energy it offers us.
 Do not force it if it is painful, now is when we begin to listen to the body and pay attention to its needs.
 Inhaling big through the nose and blowing out through the mouth, releasing any bad energy or tension out with the breath.
,, The counter tops are immaculate white and grey marble and the cupboards are soft white wooden panels.
With your eyes closed, imagine yourself walking through this kitchen towards the large stainless steel refrigerator. Your bare feet feel the cool tile beneath them.
Grasp the handle. Once you wrap all five fingers around the steel handle, pull the door towards you.
Reach into the fridge and grab the only large, bright yellow lemon inside. Once you have it in your hand, place it on to the counter to your left of the refrigerator.
Reach into the drawer below the counter and pull out a clean, sturdy knife.
Slice the lemon once in half, and then half the halves.
