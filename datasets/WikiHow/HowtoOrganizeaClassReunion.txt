 Select people that will go the extra mile to ensure the reunion is a great success. Appoint one person to set up conferences and set up meeting agendas. Appoint a second person to oversee the financial sector of the reunion.;
, Share your work with your committee members that you assemble. Usually, there are lots and lots of details that are necessary and must be worked out.
 Some locations where you may be interested in may require up to one year in advance in booking. Also you need the time because some of your fellow graduates may live very far away and need to clear time to attend your reunion on the specific date.
 During the meetings divide the activities that you plan into work groups.
 You'll have make decisions on how much are you going to charge to cover expenses on various items.
, It might be a good idea to plan a few speeches, do a tribute to classmates that have passed away over the years. But allocate most of the reunion to free socializing. Another great attraction is a slide show in one corner of the room. If you want dancing to your reunion play music relative to your generation.
