 Tori wears it down most of the time. On special occasions, you can straighten it and put it into a side part. Long layers are the way to go!;
, If a tan is unachievable, just make sure your skin is healthy or use a tinted moisturizer such as Jergens.
 Tori always sports a beachy, effortless look. If you're pale, sweep on some bronzer. Wear a tiny bit of blush, eyeliner, curled lashes with 1-2 coats of mascara, and gloss. If your skin is in a bad condition, feel free to reach for a concealer/foundation.
 Tori has a slim, healthy figure and says in her video profile at www.theslap.com that she likes to stay in shape. Victoria Justice, the actress who portrays Tori, loves to eat, so do not starve yourself.
