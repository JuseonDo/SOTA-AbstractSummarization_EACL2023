 These are usually made out of wood, and consist of two horizontal bars that pull together. They are ideal for suit pants.
 The hand pockets should be on the inside, and the seat of the pants should be on the outside.
 Grip the hook part of the hanger and pull it towards you. The two horizontal bars should open up.
 You will be hanging these pants by the cuffs. You don't want to hang these pants by the waistband when using this type of hanger. This is because bulky things, such as buttons and zippers, get in the way. They prevent the hanger from closing together all the way., Push the hook part back down towards the hanger and away from you.
