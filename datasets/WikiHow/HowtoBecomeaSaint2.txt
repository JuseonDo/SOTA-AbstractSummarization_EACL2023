 Hopefully this should grow naturally out of your extraordinary life and works.
 This will get the ball rolling, but you have a long way to go before the canonization process is complete.
 A postulate will pour over the details of your life, works and your writings. Any miracles attributed to you will also be thoroughly and skeptically investigated. Make sure everything is squeaky cleanâ€”nothing is off the table for this investigation, and a "devil's advocate" will be around arguing against your case.
 This is simply an acknowledgement that you lived an especially holy life, or were martyred, but it is the first step on the canonization process.
 After that you will be called "blessed," and a feast day will be dedicated to you in your home diocese, your religious order, and in places significant to your life works.
 If the Vatican recognizes a second miracle attributed to you, the pope may then name you a Saint. You will be assigned a feast day that can be celebrated by Catholics everywhere, and churches can be named in your honor.
 Now that Catholics are officially permitted to venerate you, they can ask you to speak with God on their behalf.
