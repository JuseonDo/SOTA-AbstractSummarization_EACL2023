start by doing handstands on your trampoline.

@summary

once you are able to do that very well, try doing it by jumping in the air 3-8 times then doing a handstand.

@summary

@summary

 When doing the handstand fall over onto your back or bottom. Keep doing this for about 2 days.;
, That means go on your hands then fall over as quickly (and safely) as possible. Do this for about 1-2 weeks.
 Be careful when doing this! Do this for about 1 week.
 Make sure you go fast. And make sure your head is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) off the ground. If not, jump higher! And jump a few times before you flip. Just jump and pretend you are doing a handstand but forgot to put your hands down. Keep your arms by your side or straight out for balance. If you do not feel comfortable, then wait a few more days. You will land on your back or bottom.
 This is a little trickier. What you need to do is jump in the air ( don't flip forward yet) and then land on your feet but have your bottom about 2 feet (0.6 m) off the ground. Keep doing this for a week.
 When you go to land , try keeping your legs bent and feet flat. You may land on your bottom, or you may land on your feet but then slip and fall onto your bottom. Do this for 3-5 weeks.This takes about 2 -4 months to master.
 When you land, lean forward a tiny bit. You will land on your feet and will be leaning forward so that will make you not fall backwards.
 Try keeping your legs straight while flipping then bending them a little when you land . Don't keep your legs locked! This can cause a serious injury.
