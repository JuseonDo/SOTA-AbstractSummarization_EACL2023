 The #1 complaint that most candidates have with Recruiters is their lack of communication. However, the problem is that any successful recruiter will have hundred of candidates to communicate with at any given time.;
, The company with the job is the client of the Executive Recruiter. Except in very rare circumstances, candidates don't pay fees.
 As mentioned above, any successful recruiter will have very limited time and more phone calls to make in a day than he can possibly make in any given day.
 Candidates with attitudes rarely get called back. Recruiters may refuse to call candidates back simply because they appeared to have a bad attitude.
 There is a big difference between appearing motivated and desperate. A quick email once per week should suffice.
 Treat every conversation with your recruiter like you would a conversation with the hiring company.
, It is very common to see candidates work with an Executive Recruiter until they have a job and then they fall of the face of the earth and never speak with that recruiter again.
