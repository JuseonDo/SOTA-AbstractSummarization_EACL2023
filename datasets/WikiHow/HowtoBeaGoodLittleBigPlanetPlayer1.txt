 Inspiration will always fuel the need to make, build, and actually find an idea. So if you based it on nature, you would use wood, grass and more nature based things.;
, Consider the design of the level beforehand so your building will go smoothly. For example, think about enemies for the game. Try to think of an engaging/not boring game.
 Try learn about everything you can do. This way your true potential can shine through. You could even develop a strategy when building.
 A good place takes time and effort.
 This way people would stick around. Cool ideas will keep them around.
