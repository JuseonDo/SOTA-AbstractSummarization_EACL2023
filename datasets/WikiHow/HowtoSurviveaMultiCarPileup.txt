 You are legally required to do this in many countries, however you should do this even if not legally required to do so. Also ensure that everyone else in the vehicle is wearing their seat belt. Even if you are wearing your seat belt, someone else who is not wearing their seat belt could be thrown into you in a collision and cause death or serious injury.;
, In a collision, the airbags will inflate. When airbags inflate, they shoot out so fast that anyone leaning against the dashboard could be thrown backwards and seriously injured or killed.
 (The front seat position for child seats is illegal in many places.) Regardless of legality, if possible, rear-facing child seats should always be fitted in the rear of the car.
 This is dangerous for the same reasons it is dangerous to lean against the dashboard.
 These are extremely dangerous if sent flying in a collision. If you have heavy objects, place them in the trunk or tie them down securely so that they cannot move if impacted.
 There may be further collisions.
 Switch off your engine first.
 The pileup may have involved a vehicle which is carrying dangerous goods. You may not be able to tell this just by looking at vehicles, so assume that it is unsafe to light up.
 If it is safe to do this, find ways to warn others; for example, using a warning triangle. This will reduce the likelihood of further collisions.
