 If it is a landline, listen for a dial tone with the dial button is clicked. Check to make sure the base is plugged in and the phone is charged before you move on to the next tests.


If it is a cell phone, try calling a number in your contacts since you will not be able to hear a dial tone.;
, If you have to find a new phone to do so, you will want to keep the receipt so that you can return it if your old phone isn’t faulty.
 You can also go on your computer and use an online calling system, such as Skype.
 If the call doesn’t go through, despite a dial tone, you may have a problem with your line.
 Look for a website for customer service. You can also go directly to a search engine and type in “Report a fault” and the telephone company name.
 Type your phone number into the space provided and the phone system will check to see if there are problems with the line., You will need to submit a form that will result in a service call.
