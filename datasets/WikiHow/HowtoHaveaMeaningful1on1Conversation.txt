, Ideally if the other person starts off, and you are ready to respond, a meaningful conversation can ensue. If you're not sure, ask the other person.
 If you do not, it's visible and felt. Unless a conversation adds positively to both parties, it's likely to be debilitating in some way.
 Even advise given through a conversation is useful only if both parties see value in it.
 Most dialogues (with no preformed strong opinions) would require a level of trust. If there is a lack of trust on either side, the first step would possibly be to build some trust. It can be built through the conversation itself and sometimes by being upfront and open about the level of trust. Unless you understand and put the problem on the table, the solution will not emerge.
 The term conversation is misunderstood as speaking. Listening is the most important part of a conversation. Deep, empathetic listening can raise the quality of the 1-1 interaction immensely.
 If fact, if you look back, some of the most meaningful and understanding conversations are characterized by the quality of silences in it.
 Words, and more importantly, the tone and body language, can take away from the effectiveness of any face to face conversation.Pay attention to how you come across, watch yourselves speaking in front of the mirror. Or record yourself through a camera having a conversation and play it back--it's amazing what you'll see and hear.
 People give you instant feedback through their body language, tone and voice.It is great feedback to work on yourselves and the conversation.
