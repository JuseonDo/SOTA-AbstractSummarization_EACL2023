 Go to yahoo or hotmail or gmail or something like that. These websites make it easy for someone who is doing their first email address, and they have a very simple set up.;
, It's also an option to get email addresses from other friends who already have the address. Go home and add them to your contacts. Once again your email server should make this fairly easy to do.
 You can go to a website that makes E-cards, or make an email yourself. Websites such as hallmark.com have some free E-cards that you can personalize. Option two is make one yourself.
 Mess around with the colors and sizes to make it flashy. Make sure to include things like who's party it is, when and where, what to bring, what it's for (like for fun or is this a birthday party?). Basically include the who, what, where, when, why, and how. Mess around with the colors until it looks the way you want it to, preppy, and fun, might be a good idea. Include if you want them to RSVP and then click send.
