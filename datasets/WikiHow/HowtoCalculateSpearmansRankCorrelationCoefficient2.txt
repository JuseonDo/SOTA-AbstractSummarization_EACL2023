@summary
draw your data table.

@summary
fill in the first two columns with your pairs of data.

@summary
,

@summary
in your third column rank the data in your first column from 1 to n (the number of data you have).

@summary
in your fourth column do the same as in step 3, but instead rank the second column.

@summary
in the "d" column calculate the difference between the two numbers in each pair of ranks.

@summary
square each of the numbers in the "d" column and write these values in the "d2" column.

@summary
,

@summary
add up all the data in the "d2" column.

@summary
choose one of these formulae:

@summary
if there was no tie in previous steps, insert this value into the simplified spearman's rank correlation coefficient formula

@summary
and replace the "n" with the number of pairs of data you have to calculate the answer.

@summary
interpret your result.

 This will organize the information you need to calculate Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. You will need:

6 Columns, with headers as shown below.
As many rows as you have pairs of data.
, Give the lowest number a rank of 1, the next lowest number a rank of 2, and so on.









If two (or more) pieces of data in one column are the same, find the mean of the ranks as if those pieces of data had been ranked normally, then rank the data with this mean.
In the example at right, there are two 5s that would otherwise have ranks of 2 and 3. Since there are two 5s, take the mean of their ranks. The mean of 2 and 3 is 2.5, so assign the rank 2.5 to both 5s.
 That is, if one is ranked 1 and the other 3 the difference would be 2. (The sign doesn't matter, since the next step is to square this number.)

,, This value is Σd2.






If there were ties in any of previous steps, use the standard Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient formula instead:






, It can vary between -1 and 1.

Close to -1 - Negative correlation.
Close to 0 - No linear correlation.
Close to 1 - Positive correlation.
Remember to divide by the exact total of results, then half it. After, divide it by Σd2.
