 Stir together using a large craft stick.
 Fold and mix well with a craft stick until the mixture is gooey and resembles slime.

 Place the black light on and have fun playing with the glowing rainbow slime and looking at its bright colors. You may like combining multiple slime colors to make the slime really resemble a rainbow (but be careful not to fully mix them together, or the slime will turn gray).
