If you are using a micro- or mini-SD card, insert it into an SD card adapter, and place the adapter on a flat surface, label up.;
, It should be on the upper-left side of the SD card.


The lock switch is typically a small white or silver tab that protrudes from the left side of the SD card.
 This turns off the SD card's write protection and enables you to store files and data on the card.To completely erase the contents of the SD card, format it as a new card.
