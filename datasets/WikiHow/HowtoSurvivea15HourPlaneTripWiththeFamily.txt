 Packing wisely all depends on the baggage allowance, your age, your hobbies, etc. etc. For young children pack lots to keep them entertained but for older kids, the TV provided on the plane, a book and there iPod, should keep them entertained, if they pack to much there carry on will just take up space.;
, Have a bum bag ready with all your passports and tickets in there, have chewing gum for take off and landing, moisturizer for when your skin gets dry and be wearing comfortable clothes, high heels and your fanciest dress aren't so stylish when your 30,000 feet (9,144.0Â m) in the air. Also wear slip on shoes so they are easy to remove and put back on during security check.
, Take of your shoes, jewelry, hoodie/hat and anything else you need to remove.
, It won't give you much more room but even if it is a few Cm's it will help!

,,, Even if you can't, just rest, it will make you feel less tired and help out with your jet lag.
 It will make you feel less of a mess.
 They will make the ride more pleasant.
 If you don't, you will sweat and this will make you feel dirty.
 They may be gross, but it's better then having a sore gut because you have hung on to long

, As soon as you can get out of the there, out of that aeroplane and then as soon as you can get out of the airport

, Enjoy that cold breeze and sunshine.
