 You can do this using a handheld mixer or an electric mixer fitted with paddles. To make the mixing even easier, cut the butter into cubes first.
 Make sure that there are no lumps or clumps. This will ensure that your frosting is nice and smooth.
 If you don't have heavy cream, you can use half-and-half instead. Make sure that the vanilla is evenly distributed throughout the heavy cream.
 Alternate between the sugar and heavy cream, and beat on low speed after adding each one.
 Give the frosting a taste. If it is too sweet for you, add a pinch of salt, and mix again.If it is too thick, add some more heavy cream. If it is too thin, add some more sugar.
 Make sure that the cupcakes are completely cool first, or the frosting will melt. You can spread it on using a spatula, or you can pipe it on using a piping bag and decorator's nozzle.
