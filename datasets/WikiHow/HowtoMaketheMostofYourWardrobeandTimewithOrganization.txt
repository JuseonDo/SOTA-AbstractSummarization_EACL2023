 The clothes in each category should be essentially interchangeable. For a man in a white-collar job, the largest categories might be dress shirts, dress pants, suits, ties, briefs, socks, t-shirts, casual pants, and casual long-sleeve shirts.;
,, Hangers are effective but consume much space and, depending on one's proficiency in folding versus hanging, time. A deep shelf or drawer with a tilt-up front is better than a regular drawer because items can be slid out of the bottom rather than requiring an entire stack to be lifted to access its last item.
,,, Clothes on shelves do not stack well on end. Instead, make a series of short stacks and move the stacks from one side to the other as earlier stacks are depleted.
 Small items such as socks and underwear can go in a single-purpose bin. A bottom-emptying hopper would be better, but the bin can simply be mixed or its contents turned over from time to time. (If the general public is commenting that you wear the same underwear too often, the belt or suspenders queue has gone wrong -- check on it.)

, Belts can be taken off one long peg or loop to be worn, and returned to another. When that peg runs out, take them off the other one and return them to the first as they are gone through., Ties can similarly be moved from one side to the other of a multi-tie rack.
 Clothes that can be worn more than once should be worn a day or two apart, with new clothes in between, not twice in succession. Once-worn clothes should be kept in a different area to air out without transferring volatile dirt to clean clothes.
 The precise order of washing, sorting, folding and returning clothes to queues does not matter so long as all of the clothes are washed and folded at once, or the dirty-laundry and unfolded-clothes piles are periodically inverted to retrieve items lingering at the bottom of stacks.


A suspended clothes net, bin, or other bottom-opening hopper could solve this problem more elegantly.
