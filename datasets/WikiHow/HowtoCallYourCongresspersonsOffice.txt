Find out who your 2 Senators are, as well as your Representative in the House of Representatives.;
, This is usually between 8am and 5pm, Monday to Friday, local time.
 A simple hello and greeting sets the stage for a productive, meaningful conversation.
 Say "I know you are busy taking calls, but I would like to have my concern/messaged passed along to Representative X/Senator X."


Introduce yourself. Give your full name, say you are a constituent of Representative X or Senator X. Tell them where you live and give your zip code.
 For example:


"I was delighted to hear that Senator X co-sponsored legislation for research for Type 1 Diabetes."
"I am pleased to see Representative X voted in favor of House Bill X on X"

, Don't focus on too many issues at once; just shoot for 1-2.


Provide your own personal experience on how the issue effects you, your family, your friends, your community, etc. For example, "Because of the Affordable Care Act, when I was diagnosed with cancer at age 25, I was able to get the best treatment possible and afford it because I was still under my parents plan."

, For example, don't say, "The Representative/Senator is an a** h*le." Instead, say "I was really displeased and surprised in their vote on issue X."

, Sometimes the person on the other line might have a rebuttal or want to clarify a position that the Representative/Senator has said or done. Let them speak and thank them for that.
 Say a polite goodbye and hang up.
