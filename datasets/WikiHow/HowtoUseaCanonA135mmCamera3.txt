, The frame indicator will go backwards as you wind. Keep winding until the rewind lever goes very stiff, and then suddenly turns much more freely. When the latter happens, this means your film is free of the transport sprocket. Wind it in a bit further if you like., The back of the camera will spring open. Remove your film and get it developed. Load in another roll and carry on enjoying this superb classic camera!
