 Make sure that the camp allows cellphones, and if it doesn't, respect the rules and bring no cellphones. Not all camps have cell phone service. Some have pay phones, though. Writing letters is allowed (usually) and makes camp more, well, campy.;
, This has different results for different people, so think long and hard about whether you want them around. Camp is a place where no one knows you and you can start fresh, so having that familiar face may be a danger to your reputation.
 Maybe bringing your favorite blanket will pay off in the long run.
 Be friendly! Open up, try to make buddies the very first day. Don't be afraid to be outgoing. Everyone else is just as nervous as you are.
 Enjoy yourself! You will later regret remembering your summer at camp as the one where you did nothing but missed your parents and cried the whole time! Stuff as much fun into the summer as possible!

, You could even sleep in it at night! Make sure you don't lose it!
