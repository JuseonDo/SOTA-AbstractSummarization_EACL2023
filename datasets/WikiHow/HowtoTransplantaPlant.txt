@summary
water all of the plants that you wish to transplant using a transplanting fertilizer.

@summary
fill up the destination pot with potting soil.

@summary
mix the same transplanting fertilizer from step 1 with an equal amount of water and saturate the soil of the destination pot with the mixture.

@summary
dig out a hole in the destination pot with the approximate same dimensions as the size of the pot from which the plant will be transplanted.

@summary
,

@summary
remove the plant from its original pot.

@summary
place the plant in the destination pot, being careful not to damage the roots.

@summary
keep the new pot in a place with low levels of light for a few days.

 You should do this approximately 1 or 2 days before the actual day of transplanting in order to let the fertilizer do its work.;
, You should use enough potting soil to reach approximately 2 inches (5.1Â cm) below the rim of the pot.
 Make sure that there are absolutely no dry soil areas in your destination pot.
, Grab the base of the plant with a flat hand, make sure to cover as much of the topsoil as possible. Flip the pot upside down and carefully pull the plant out with the soil. Don't move too quickly or else you may damage the roots in the process.
 Use a little bit of extra soil to fill in any holes and make sure that none of the roots are exposed. Lightly water the pot with the water-fertilizer mixture from before.
 It will take a day or 2 for the plant to adjust to its new soil environment, and only then should you bring it back into a full-light environment.
