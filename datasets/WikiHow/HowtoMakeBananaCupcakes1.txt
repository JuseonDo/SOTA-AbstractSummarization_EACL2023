 Either use silicone cupcake cases on their own, or paper cupcake cases in a muffin pan (this helps to hold their shape best).;
, You can do this using handheld mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks.
 Mix the butter mixture well after each egg that you add.
 Peel, slice, and mash the bananas first, then add them to the butter mixture. The more ripe your bananas are, the better.


If you like chocolate, consider adding 1 cup (175 grams) of semi-sweet chocolate chips., To add more flavor to your cupcakes, add ¼ teaspoon of ground nutmeg or ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon., Alternate between the two, and mix well after each one.


You can also use ½ to ¾ cup (125 to 190 grams) of plain or vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk.
 Line a cupcake pan with some paper cupcake liners first, then use a spoon or ice cream scoop to fill them. You can also use silicone cupcake liners instead; place them on a baking sheet.
 The cupcakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.
 Allow them to cool for 10 minutes first, then remove them from the pan, and set them down on a cooling rack. Let them finish cooling the rest of the way before continuing., Good combinations with banana for the frosting flavor include: chocolate, peanut butter, and vanilla. You can spread the frosting onto the cupcakes using a spatula, or you can pipe them on using a piping bag.
