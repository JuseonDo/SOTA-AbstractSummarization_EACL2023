the antiquated, refined elegance of victorian goth and the rough, edgy futurism of rivetheads may seem a completely incompatible combination.

steampunk is, in essence, science fiction that takes place the low-technology setting of the past (very often the victorian era).

steampunk goth fashion is highly creative, incorporating elements that evoke victorian technology such as clocks, keys and cogs.

 But, thanks to a particular genre of fantasy, the two have been successfully wedded to create the Steam punk Goth.
 In Steam punk, you may find steam-powered robots, clockwork computers and complex contraptions made from wood, brass and wheels. The merging of Victorian imagery with quirky technology is doubtlessly of huge appeal to many Goths, but perhaps the most important links between Steam punk and Goth culture are the Victorian writers who inspired the genre, including Mary Shelley and Edgar Allen Poe., Although Steam punk is not a music scene, acts such as Rasputina, Emilie Autumn and Abney Park have all been cited as having Steampunk appeal.
