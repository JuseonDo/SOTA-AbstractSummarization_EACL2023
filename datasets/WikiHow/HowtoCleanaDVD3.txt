 As a slight abrasive, toothpaste is good at polishing DVDs, just as it polishes your teeth. Be gentle with toothpaste, however; DVDs aren't as long-lasting as your teeth.
 A popcorn kernel-sized amount should be more than enough.


Avoid extra-whitening toothpastes. You want to use the toothpaste as a slight abrasive, not as a bleaching agent.
 Buff away any scratches that are visible.
 Be sure to wipe away any toothpaste still on the disc.
