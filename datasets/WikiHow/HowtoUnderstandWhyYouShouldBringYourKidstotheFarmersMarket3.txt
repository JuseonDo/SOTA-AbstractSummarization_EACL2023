as mentioned above, a lot of the farmers we meet are very proud of the work they do and they're very happy to talk about it.

 This is a good match because farming is really amazing. Think about it: plant seeds in dirt, add water, get vegetables! Of course there's a lot more to it than that.
 With a little coaching (if necessary) you're kids can ask some great questions, like- Why are you a farmer? What's your favorite things to grow? What's that hardest thing to grow? The easiest? Do you use chemicals or pesticides? Why, or why not?

, The next time you go to the market your kids will remember the farmers. It's great to make new friends, especially when their doing something as important as growing your food.
