 Some seals will slowly dry out and crack over time due to exposure to extreme hot and cold temperatures.
 Some seals will sag or lose their shape, causing water to build up in the seal's trough. When the water pools, it can eventually create holes in the seal.
 Brush a thick layer of the liquid electrical tape on, making sure it covers cover any visible wear. The tape dries to form a protective, waterproof barrier. Press the tape down around the seal. Let it dry following the liquid tape manufacturer's directions.
 Check inside the car to see if you still have leaks.
 Leaks that are not associated with the drainage tubes or seals are usually factory flaws that can only be fixed by installing a new sunroof.
