 All of the necessary account information is publicly available, but you will need to do a bit of research to find it. Visit the County Recorder’s office, in the county where the home is, to find the property title. Once you have the property title find the name of lender.


Alternatively you can hire a title examiner to do the research for you. It will cost you more but save you time and energy., Search the Internet or call the lender to find their payment address.
 Visit a USPS office to purchase a money order. This is an anonymous form of payment., Mail the money order to the lender's payment address. Write the homeowner name and address on the money order. Also, include the account number if you know it. However, this may be hard to find without contacting the homeowner.
