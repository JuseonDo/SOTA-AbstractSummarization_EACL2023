 This will usually be called- LET I.;

, Make sure your hand is flat and is correctly positioned on your glasses, eyebrow, or cover.
 The bottom of the tie should just barely be able to touch the top of your belt buckle if you are a male in JROTC.
 These and other drill / marching commands can be found in Army Field Manual 22-5 aka the blue book.
 Commands should be reasonable such as "Cadet, please notify First Sergeant that we need assistance in the supply room,"  not "Cadet, I order you to shine my shoes."

, If you are too quiet or too loud people will think you are not bold enough to be a leader or too bold and a know it all. For example:

FM 22-5 goes into more detail about command voice.
 Staff is the backbone of your battalion. They are the behind the scenes gears that keep everything going smoothly in terms of training and public affairs.
 This means wear your uniform on the day it is assigned, do your job, keep a clean shave if you are a male, don't fight or use drugs in uniform (or at all for that matter) and so forth.
 Join Drill, Raider, Color guard, Rifle team etc. Not only will you get your name out in the battalion, you will bond with the cadets on the team as well. Trust and respect will get you farther than trying to be cool and a show off.
