 Observe your house and yard. Will the dog be an outdoor dog or an indoor dog? Make sure your yard or house is big enough for them to live in, whether they are an outdoor dog or an indoor dog. Even a small dog such as a Dachshund will need a lot of space.;
, If you are busy, you should get a low maintenance dog, such as an older beagle. If not, you could try getting a medium or high maintenance dog such as a poodle puppy. You also need to be able to afford the dog's food, water, toys, crate, veterinary care, grooming, etc.
 Your dog should not become dominant over you or it will create a lot of problem behavior. You need to emit a sense of authority over your dog.
