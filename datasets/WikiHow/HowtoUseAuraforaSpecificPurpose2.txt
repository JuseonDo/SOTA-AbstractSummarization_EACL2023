 You've figured out what the heck you're doing. Now, you need to set a goal.
 If you're trying to make someone change emotions, think "Make (name) feel (emotion)." over and over. If you're trying to heal someone (a more advanced technique), think "Heal (name)." repeatedly.
 As long as you have a goal and a means to accomplish it, you're pretty much set.
