@summary
while that heats up, place a sprig (mostly leaves) of dill and optional garlic clove in the bottom of each jar, and then fill with sea beans.once vinegar boils, fill jars, leaving 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) at the top of each.place lids on jars, making sure the edges are clean.

@summary
now one more boil, place jars in a pot with water to 3/4 height of jar.

 This isn’t a super crucial step since we’re using vinegar in the pickling (a soap and water wash is probably fine), but it’s a good habit to get into, and becomes more important when making naturally fermented pickles.
 Place in microwave on high for 5-8 minutes, and forget about them for a bit. This is a good time to put your lids and rims in some water to boil. They should boil for about 10 minutes. (Don’t put them in the microwave unless you want to have a really good story about explosions in the kitchen!), Peel your garlic and...well that’s about it, it’s super easy. If you want to get a bit OCD, and want your finished product to be a work of food art, the envy of your peers, and a testament to the validity of the dominant power of the human race on our small planet, you can pick out the long sea beans and arrange them in piles according to size and direction. If not, that’s cool too.
,, If you want, you can stand them all up in one direction, for vanity's sake. Then place a sprig of dill on top.
,, Boil for 10 minutes.
 So easy, so delicious. Well, not quite done. After they cool check to make sure the lids don’t pop, if they do, the vacuum didn’t seal, and they should be put in the fridge to pickle. Place the jars in a cool dark place, and let sit for 4-6 weeks.
