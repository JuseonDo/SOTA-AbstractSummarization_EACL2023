@summary
participate in the whole meeting or class activity, discussion, your small group, or paperwork/board work (go to the board and try the problem).

@summary
be agreeable, working with the manager/teacher and contributing to discussions with coworkers/or fellow students who give solutions (putting solutions on the chalk-/or marker-board) -- helping sort out ideas or showing how the answer is/was found.

@summary
get into the subject as if it belongs to you.

@summary

 Be into it. Be on.
 Being positive, involved, if only smiling, nodding "yes", saying "Right; I agree!" which makes you alert and engaged!

, Don't fight it! Try reciting main ideas in your mind when there is a lull or pause in presentation, material, or lecture in other training; don't break the reverie. People can feel as if they're living in a bubble, which they don't necessarily wish to come out of... Concentrating and feeling protected by some sort of separation from the rest of the world. It helps feeling generally relaxed and hyper-focused on the here and now.Committing complexities to memory and understanding it in context is necessary. Make it part of you... not just the facts; the drama, the scheme of it all; what is it, and how does each concept fit into the whole panorama of your subject.
 Maybe you have a friend in the same class who will work on studying for a big sales presentation or a test or hard homework or other assignments with you. Make a friend! Do your part.
~ Be like a performer or an athlete in the zone. You can find that space for that special activity in the rush and crush of the moment when working to finish on a deadline, or to finish a work. Polish that piece of a report or that creative writing...
