Advantages of top-load washers are that they are significantly lower in cost and easy to load. Top-load washers also complete wash cycles in less time than front-load washers. However, top-load washers are not as energy-efficient as front-load washers, and they require more water. They also hold smaller loads and generally do not clean as thoroughly.;

If you are working with a very small amount of space, you may choose to narrow your search to only include stackable washer and dryer sets. These can fit in most large closets, and are commonly used in apartments, condominiums and small homes.
 Make sure the dryer you select is compatible.
 You can also make a second list of features that would be nice to have, but aren't mandatory.


Available features include automatic dispensers, automatic temperature control, extra rinse cycle, touchpad controls, porcelain lids, stainless steel drums, steam settings and time delay.
, See if they have recommendations or warnings. You can also read consumer reviews to help you determine which washers and dryers offer the most value.
 Ask retailers if they are offering sales, promotions or special financing. Make your purchase at the retailer that is willing to provide the best deal.


If you are financing your purchase, remember to ask about the costs of annual fees and interest. If your washer and dryer costs less at one store, but the financing plan charges high interest, then you may be able to save more money by paying a larger amount up front at a different store and spend less in interest over time.
