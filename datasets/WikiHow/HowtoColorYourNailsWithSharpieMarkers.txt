, Remove your other polish if you have any. Then trim, cut or file your nails as needed.
 This will protect your natural nails from staining (although the Sharpie will come off) and help you remove the design easier with nail polish remover

, If you are right handed, color your left, and vice versa. When you're finished, ask someone to do your other hand for you.
 It'll be a lot shinier than if you just leave it, and it will last longer. This is optional.
,, Your nails should be neatly trimmed and filed.;
, Try using crayola markers, they do make good fake nail polish! Try to have them be washable, in case you don't want it and want to wash it off. Also, although the fat markers make it messier to paint nails, use them because they won't run out of ink as quickly as thinner ones. Watercolor paints work well too, as they wash off better.
 You should wear something that matches. If you are wearing a purple dress or shirt, put on purple! Always make sure that it matches -- otherwise you'll look really odd (and your parents will find out!).
, Don't mind about messing up -- the ink can be removed.
 Eat a snack, clean up your supplies, or just do something that lasts a minute.
 They should be dry, but look for parts of the nail without as much color as others. Take your marker and repaint the lighter areas of the nail. The color across the nail should be consistently strong.
 Gently brush around the nail and remove all the marker that is not on the nail.
 Enjoy your "fake nail polished" nails!
