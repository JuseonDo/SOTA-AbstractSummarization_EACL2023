 Use a rubber spatula to stir everything together. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often so that everything gets evenly mixed.Almond milk is recommended for this recipe, but you can use a different type of milk as well.
You can use any type of yogurt you like. Flavored yogurt is recommended, but you can use plain if you prefer.
 If you don't like cinnamon, you can use another type of baking spice or sweetener. If you used flavored yogurt, such as vanilla or strawberry, then you probably don't need to add much, if anything, in. If you used plain yogurt, however, a dash of cinnamon or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup would be a good idea.
 Once the chia seeds thicken, give them another quick stir. This will help prevent things from clumping up.
 The mixture will continue to thicken, giving you a tasty, pudding-like treat for breakfast the following morning.


If you are too impatient, you can eat the breakfast bowl the same day. It may not be as thick, however.
 Give the mixture a good stir first. If it is too thick, stir in some more milk. Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into two bowls. Be sure to scrape the bowl clean!

, Wash, peel, and slice up a few pieces of your favorite fruit. Layer the fruit on top of the bowl in even stripes. Toss in a handful of nuts, seeds, or granola for extra crunch.


Leave smaller fruits, such as blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries whole.
Try to use a combination of different types of fruit.
How much fruit and nuts you add is up to you.
