 Also, when the bike sits for a few days the oil may drain from the oil bag into the engine. Since this is a dry sump oil system you will be draining the oil bag and whatever ended up in the engine by this type of drain will remain there and will mix with the new oil after the change. Also, the warm oil is much more willing to flow and will drain more readily.;
, You will need a drain pan, a flat blade screwdriver, an oil filter wrench, which is optional.
 The free end of it will be plugged with a plastic plug that also doubles as a clip that holds the hose to the frame tube.
,, Straddle the bike and right it. The stream should resume. Keep the bike upright until you hear the stream return to a drip.
 You should hear the stream again. Wait until it runs out.
 You'll come back to it after the next few steps.
, of fresh oil into the new filter, spread a thin film of the fresh oil onto the filter gasket and screw the new filter on. Tighten it with your hands about a quarter turn past the point of gasket-to-seat contact. Do not over-tighten unless you like using oil filter wrenches. Once the gasket seats the oil will not leak as the oil pressure in these bikes is not high. If you get a leak tighten a bit more, but only a little.
 By this time some more oil has made its way down and you will get some additional oil out. After this re-install the plug, tighten the hose clamp and clip the hose back onto the frame tube.
