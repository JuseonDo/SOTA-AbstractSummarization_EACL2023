 With your file open in Photoshop, the first thing you want to do is make sure that it is small enough for the web. Go to Image and scroll down to Image Size, this will show a dialogue that displays your current image size settings. In pixel dimensions, make sure that neither dimension is above 1000 pixels and for the resolution, be sure to make the image 72 dpi (the standard for web images).;
, In the bottom left corner of the Dialogue that appeared, the size of your file is shown, it is important to pay attention to this, because your goal is to get that as low as you possibly can without sacrificing the quality of your image (Below 120K.)

,, Now it should be ready for posting!
