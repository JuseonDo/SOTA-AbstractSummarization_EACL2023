Machines that don’t have this logo don’t have the top-up service.
 Do this by inserting your card and typing in your PIN like you would normally do when you’re trying to withdraw cash or check your account balance.
 Just press the machine button next to the option to select it.


This will display a new screen asking you to choose your mobile phone operator.
 Again, just press the machine button beside the option to select it.
 You can chose from £10, £15, £20, £30, £40, and £50; just press the machine button beside the value you want to select it.
 Use the cash machine’s numeric keypad to do this.


You’ll be ask to do this twice, so just re-enter the phone number when the machine prompts you to do so.
When you’re done, press the green Enter button beside the keypad.
A message on the ATM screen will notify you that the top-up is complete. Your Orange phone should be reloaded with the denomination you selected.
