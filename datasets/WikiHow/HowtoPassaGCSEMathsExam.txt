 There are many websites and revision guides offering clear instructions about everything you may come across in the exam. These often include practice questions; always give these a go during your studies.;
, Set some times for when you will study and have breaks. For example you could take a 15-minute break after studying for 45 minutes, but you can still organize study times yourself.
 However you can still use these things as rewards after you've done your revision for the day.
 These will help you get used to the layout of exam papers and you'll understand what the questions are like in the exam.
 You'll perform much better after a good night's sleep.
, Most exam boards require you to have a black ballpoint pen, HB pencil, rubber, ruler, protractor and compass. You'll also need a calculator if you're doing a calculator paper, and tracing paper may be necessary for questions about rotations.
 Don't forget to write down your name, candidate number and centre number before you start!

, Once you've been through the entire paper, look through everything again and try to work on questions you couldn't answer during the first run.
 Sometimes if you get an answer wrong, correct working can still earn you marks.
 This is very important as it could mean the difference between a pass or a fail!
