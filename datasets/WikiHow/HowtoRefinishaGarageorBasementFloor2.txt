 A plastic watering works well for pouring the solution on the concrete. Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands while etching the floors.


All newly poured concrete or bare concrete floors must be etched for the garage or basement epoxy coating to stick properly.
, Start in a corner away from the door to avoid working yourself into a corner.
 Work a bristly utility broom back and forth in one direction. Then scrub the same area a second time, working the etching solution across the same area perpendicular to the first direction. Etch the entire garage in small sections.
 Start in the farthest corner, rinsing the floor until it is completely clear of etching solution. Let the floor dry for at least 4 hours.
