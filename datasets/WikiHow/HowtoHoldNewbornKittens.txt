if your cat has just had kittens, then the best thing to do is to leave your cat on her own for a while.

after an hour, come back to see her and the kittens.

@summary
when your cat lets you pick up the kittens, don't move your cat or take the kitten out of the room or away from its mother.

@summary
slowly slide your hand under the kitten's stomach.

@summary
pinch the scruff of the kitten's neck with your other hand, but not too hard.

@summary

@summary
let go of the scruff of its neck and place the hand that was holding it underneath the kitten's front legs.

@summary

@summary
your kitten should be standing on its back legs against your chest with its front paws against your chest.

@summary
put your free hand on its back and let it move onto the palm of the hand that is holding its back legs.

 Don't touch her or try to move her. Just give her about an hour to relax.;
, They should all be born and clean by now. If you have a strong bond with your cat, then she is more likely to let you handle the kittens. If you don't, then try to stroke the kittens. If she hisses at you, then leave the kittens alone, but let them get used to you. Do this for a few days and then try stroking them. Your cat will soon see that you mean no harm to the kittens and will soon let you pick them up. However, if when you try stroking them, your cat hisses at at you, then just have your hand near the kittens.
 Sit down to reduce the chances of the kitten getting injured if it falls. Make sure the kitten is still before picking it up to ensure you don't hurt it by trying to grab it.
 Keep your hand there to get your kitten used to the feeling. It shouldn't be that scared of you because it knows your scent.
 Keep holding it like this for a while. If the kitten struggles, then let it go and try again.
 Then quickly put your hand underneath its back legs.
 Then, slowly bring the kitten towards your chest and keep it there.
, Don't let it stay in this position for long.
 Use your other hand to stroke it. Then put it back against your chest, pick it up by the scruff of the neck, place your other hand underneath its stomach, and slowly put it back down. Do this a few times a day and remember to play with it and get it used to its name.
