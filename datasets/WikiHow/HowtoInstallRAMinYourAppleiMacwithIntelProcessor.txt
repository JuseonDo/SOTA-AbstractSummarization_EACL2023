 These can easily be acquired on Amazon. Just select the amount of ram you want and order it.


Before you do this, make sure the computer is powered off and unplugged. Also, you must make sure you are working on a static free surface such as a wooden table. These things are very important, because you could risk damaging the components in the computer if you fail to do them.
After you've powered down your computer, taking off the back is as simple as taking out all of the screws and popping the cover off. This may take some force, but that's OK. You won't break it; the computer is designed this way to prevent the cover from coming off even in the event that all the screws are missing.
 It should be easy to get to, and it will lookÂ like the RAM that you ordered., There will be two tabs on either side of the hub for the RAM that you must press on. This unlocks the actual RAM from the hub. Now simply slide the existing RAM out from the hub. You are now halfway to upgrading your RAM!, So, press the tabs on the side of the hub, slide the new ram in, and let go of the tabs. If you have multiple ram hubs, make sure the RAM card with the most memory is on top. This will ensure the fastest possible speeds., Once you've done that, reconnect the power supply, boot up the computer, and if you did everything right, everything should work properly, and you should notice your computer running faster!
