 Here's what you'll need to make sweet pickles:


2 lbs. cucumbers
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1/8 cup salt
1 cup white sugar
1/4 tsp. ground turmeric
1/2 tsp. mustard seed
2 sweet onions

, Combine 1 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/8 cup salt, 1 cup white sugar, 1/4 tsp. ground turmeric, and 1/2 tsp. mustard seed together in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.,, cucumbers and 2 sweet onions. Slice each cucumber into at least 3-4 spears, depending on the thickness of the cucumber. Dice the sweet onions into small pieces.
 Place them in tightly without crushing them. If you don't have a 1-quart jar, you can use two pint jars instead.
 Place the lid on the container and shake it well to stir around all of the ingredients.
 Keep this mixture in the fridge for at least 24 hours for best results.
 Enjoy these sweet pickle spears as a snack or as a side with your next sandwich or meal.
