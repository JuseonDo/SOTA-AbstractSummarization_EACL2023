, Go to "Things You'll Need", then read on to Step 3.
 If there is good flooring already, you can leave it bare.
 You can let your Webkinz pet help you decide where their bed will be.
 You can use a shoebox for the table and mini chairs/ socks (2) folded in half for chairs. If you want, you can place the table and chairs beside or close to your bed.
 A soft hat folded in half will do or a mini couch. Place it anywhere you want in your Webkinz home.
 You can have a mini mailbox or just a little box that opens will do. You can send your Webkinz pet bills and mail!

, A car! Any toy car big enough for your Webkinz car will do. If you don't have a toy car big enough for your Webkinz, just simply let them walk.
