 For one system, you'll need two identical small plastic flowerpots, a thin plastic plate (for example, the lid of a margarine box) and scissors. The pots on the photo are about 5 cm (2 inches) high and 5.5cm (2.2 inches) wide.;
, Then you have one flowerpot and one insert.
 The strip may be rectangular or spoon shaped. Bend the strip at one end. The short part of the strip must fit in the insert.
