 This is important because it will be easier to work with than coloring it and trying to work with it immediately.;
, The paste is more stable than liquid food coloring, making it easier to work into the paste.
 Don't put too much on the end of the skewer, just a little dab. Remember that it's always best to only add a little, as you can always add more but you can't remove once it has been added (with the exception of adding more sugar paste).
 Place the colored skewer end onto the sugar paste, then drag it across the surface to leave a trail of color.
 These will protect your hands from the color dye.
 Keep kneading until the color is even. If you need more color, add in the same manner and knead some more until the color you want is achieved.


If the tone is too dark, add more white sugar paste to even it out.
 After this rest, it should mold and shape as needed, and the color will remain stable.
