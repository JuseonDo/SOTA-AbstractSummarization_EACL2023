, Check the tips section below for ways of doing this.
 There is a Friendship Counter App available by talking to a brown-haired girl in the Eterna City Pokémon Center. The more love hearts that pop up when you touch your Pokémon's image, the more it likes you.
, The best one to go to is in the Pokémon Fan Club in Hearthome city. Have your Buneary at the front of your party when you talk to her. You can also talk to Dr. Footstep. If your Buneary is deserving of a Footprint Ribbon, it's ready to level up.
 While training it up, be careful not to let it faint! If you aren't confident about it being strong enough to battle, use a Rare Candy.
