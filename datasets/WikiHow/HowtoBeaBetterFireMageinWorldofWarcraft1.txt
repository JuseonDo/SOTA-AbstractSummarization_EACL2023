 (for you Warsong Gulches out there);
, Note: I did not say "the best gear" you don't need it to be a good fire mage. You can do this 3 ways: the Auction House (worst way); Raiding (might be good, but if that's not your cup o' tea, then don't bother); and PvP ranks.
 There a few talents that you *MUST* have to be a good fire mage. Be sure to get impact, as it provides a nice stun. Select Ignite to do extra damage on critical hits. Flame-throwing is very handy, as it allows you to strike from a longer range.
, Protect your healers, counter-spell and/or sheep enemy healers.
 Flamestrike, Arcane explosion and Blast wave will stop a flag capture, Blizzard will NOT!

, Watch for healers that are hidden to the sides, a well placed polymorph can turn the tide of battle.
 Mages are a high value target since you can bring very high damage to battle. Expect Hunters and Rogues to target you.
 Consider using scorch when you want to keep a low profile. It is fast casting, has an increased crit rate(with talents) and can generate a stacking damage-increase debuff (with talents).
