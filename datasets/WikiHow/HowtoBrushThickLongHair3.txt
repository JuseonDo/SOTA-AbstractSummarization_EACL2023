 Somehow, throughout the day, you'll probably find knots that you know you just brushed out! Though it is frustrating, you must brush them out when you can so they don't turn into dreadlocks.
 Pulling on your hair with a brush throughout the day may cause it to become unhealthy. Only brush the unnecessary large knots.
