 The easiest way to cut a hold on top of the mason jar lid is to create a paper template.


Trace around the base of the hand soap nozzle. Remove dispensing pump from soap bottle and try to trace around the base, right above the thin tubing that goes into the soap. It may be tricky with the tubing in place but do your best to get at least a rough trace.






Cut out circle using sharp scissors.

, Make sure you have enough room around the jar sides so that the lid does not crack or break when you cut out the template.
 If using the saw, you may need to get the circle started by first drilling a hole on one side of the template.
 It should fit perfectly. Remove pump in order to seal the inside of the circle.
 This will prevent the soap from spilling in case the jar is tipped over. Allow for ample dry time before assembling the jar.
