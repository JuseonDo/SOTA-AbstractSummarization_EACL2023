@summary
as always, warm up your voice with simple vocal exercises, such as humming through ascending arpeggios etcetera before you sing.

@summary
identify the high note you want to hit.

@summary
sing the note an octave below it first.

@summary
place your voice high up in your head (above your cheekbones, or even above your eyebrows).

@summary
remember that though your voice is placed in your head, it first stemmed from your diaphragm.

@summary
practice singing the two notes an octave apart for many times.

 Go as high up as you can for your vocal range without straining your throat.;
, Ensure that this note is within an achievable range. Preferably, it was the last or penultimate note you could comfortably reach during the warm-up exercises.
 Next, breathe deeply into your diaphragm and back, and simultaneously drop your inner jaw and raise your soft palette without also dropping your tongue or raising your larynx. If this sounds hard to execute in a split second, it is.
 It helps to imagine that the top of your head is big and empty. Now sing the high note with gentle yet firm support from your lower body. You should have the sensation that you are hollering.
 While singing, your voice should reverberate in your head first before being projected outside of your body.
 Move on once you manage to achieve a rich tone for your high note.
