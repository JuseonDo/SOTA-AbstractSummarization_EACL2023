 You want just the cylindrical or tube-shaped part, so cut just below where the two legs come together. Cut the leg open along one seam only. Cut off the open seam and cut off the bottom hem. You should now have a flat piece of material that is wider on one end than the other. There will be one side seam or inseam in the middle of it, which is fine.;
,, These hems will run roughly parallel to the old seam. You can do a double-fold hem or a single fold hem, but denim is tough fabric to sew on some machines, so make a single-fold hem if you are concerned about sewing through too many layers later on. It may fray a little along the edge, but it'll add character. The tools won't mind.
 You can see in this photo how the hems from the previous step should fall.
 Make the length generous. You can use ribbon, paracord, shoelaces, webbing, etc. Choose something sturdy.
 Make a sandwich with the material right sides together and the two ties between. Pin them at the long end only. Arrange the two ties on the wider end, as shown. Place them about one third and two thirds of the way up the long side. The ties will not be attached to the short side.
,, When inside out, the ties should be inside.
, Two ties should be sticking out the long end.
, Pin.
 The bag portion is complete.
 This roll-up has five pockets, but you can sew as many or as few as you have space and tools for. You can measure and mark or just eyeball the spacing. Remember that tools have thickness as well, so allow extra width if a pocket is for a specific tool or tools.
