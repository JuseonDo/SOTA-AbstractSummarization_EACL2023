 Orient them horizontally. This will make the base of your frame. You do not nee to glue them together., Orient these sticks vertically. Glue one stick in the middle of the frame base. Glue the other two sticks to the left and right of the frame base. These three sticks will hold the frame base together

, Position the photo in the center of the base, but do not glue it down. You will be using the photo as your template.


At this point, the top and bottom of your frame should have straight edges. The sides of your frame will have the wavy edges created by the curved ends of the sticks.
 Make sure that the line of glue goes from the bottom of the frame base to the top. Be sure to leave a small gap between the glue and the edge of the photo. This way, the glue won't accidentally bleed onto the photo.
 Keep the sticks vertical. Make sure that the inner edge of each stick overlaps the photo. This will help hold the photo inside the frame. If you don't overlap the photo, the photo will fall out.


At this point, you can remove the photo.
 Place a drop of glue onto the top of each vertical stick. Lay a stick down horizontally across the two vertical sticks, pressing the ends into the glue. Repeat this for the bottom.
 Make another stack just like this one. These stacks will make the bottom of your frame so that it can stand up.
 One stack will go on the front of your frame, which will hold the picture in place. The other stack will go on the back, so that the frame stand up straight., Paint your frame and let it dry before using it or decorating it further. You can write something on it, such as your name or a short message. You can also glue items onto it, such as glitter, gemstones, or buttons. For more decorating ideas, click ].


Make sure you take the picture out before decorating the frame.
