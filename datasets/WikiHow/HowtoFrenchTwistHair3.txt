@summary
gather all your hair into a low down ponytail.

@summary
twist the ponytail up.

@summary
starting alongside your face, take the comb and comb your hair back.

@summary
when you reach the twist, lift the comb a little, bringing the hair from the side over the twist.

@summary
done.
@article
 Tie it about an inch (2.5cm) from your neck.
 Rest it on our head. If you need to, you can bring the twist up and down as many times as you need to until all your hair is on your head. Hold it in place with your hand.
 As you do so, gather up hair.
 Insert the comb into the twist, gently but firmly.









If you have very long or thick hair, you may need to use two combs: one on top and one on the bottom.
 The hair will now stay neatly in place.
