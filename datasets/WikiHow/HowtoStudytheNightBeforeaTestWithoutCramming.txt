get ready to focus.

@summary
if you have been procrastinating online (which you most likely have), then close all the other tabs on your computer except this one and what you need to study (which shouldn't be much).

@summary
begin focusing.

@summary
gather all the materials you need.

@summary
begin by skimming through the entire chapter.

@summary
next, look at your notes you have and change them if need be.

@summary
decide how much time you have taken up already: it should be no more than an hour.

@summary

@summary
if you have enough time, go back and look at your classwork and homework assignments.

@summary
if you don't have enough time, then look at your quizzes instead.

@summary
study your notes next.

@summary
finally, go on to the study guides your teacher provided or if you created for yourself.

@summary
if it's not too late, then do something quiet and relaxing until 10 minutes before bed (and choose to go to bed as early as possible tonight), such as reading a calming book, knitting, or anything but getting on your computer and losing track of time!

@summary

@summary
10 minutes before bed, review your study guide one last time.

@summary
go to bed early.

@summary
get up approximately 10 minutes earlier than normal, and review the bare minimum of your study guide.

@summary
if possible then glance at it again before the test, but don't worry and go berserk about it.

@summary
good luck!

 This can take a few minutes to even an hour if you have much to do to get ready. First, ask yourself why you haven't been studying for the past few hours and assess it. If you have been at sports practice or doing other homework, it doesn't matter.;
, ((Note: if quiet music helps you concentrate, turn the radio to a station which plays only classical music. If you can't find one then use Pandora, create a "Solo Piano" radio or "Peaceful Holidays" radio which will only play instrumental.)) If you haven't been sitting on your bed for more than an hour doing nothing, then skip to the next step. But even if you've been doing nothing you should get up. Stretch, and take a break. Shower if you need to, make yourself a cup of tea or decaf coffee (you won't need caffeine), and be sure to keep a bottle of water handy.
 Close your door, tune out all other noises and turn on the lights. Get comfortable because you will be there a while.
 Choose only the raw study guides, notes, and your book to use, preferably only the things your teacher told you to use to prepare for the test.
 It may seem like a lot of work, but if your test is not that long read thoroughly and completely. This will help you review before you begin studying your study guides and get confused.
 While going through the chapter, take a look at your notes to see if they are correct and complete.
, These are great ideas to simply review, because bookwork questions are often on the test.
 These questions will almost definitely be on the test and quizzes are shorter than classwork and homework worksheets.
 Read through them once if they fill up more than 5 pages; if they are 2 to 4 pages long then read through them twice. Be sure you understand each concept. If you have fill in the blank notes cover the blank with your hand and quiz yourself using the rest of the sentence.
 If you have a checklist or something your teacher emailed, then definitely fill it out now. If it's already filled out then just review it over and over, and quiz yourself on it.
, It is scientifically proven that reviewing before bed will make you remember it well.
 Relax and envision an A on that test!

, Don't spend too much time or worry about it.
 If your teacher is laid back then use the 5 minutes wisely, or if not do it at another time, such as during lunch.
