In Windows, you can do this from My Computer or Windows Explorer.
In MacOS, you can do this using Finder.
 You'll see a list of existing map files and subfolders.
 If you already have a subfolder with this name, you won't need to create another.
 You can either put the map you created here or a map you downloaded from another source.
,, Look for the abbreviation "DotA," which may be followed by a subtype such as "Darkness Falls" or "All stars," followed by a version number.

If you can't run your DotA map from Warcraft III, your version of the game may need to have its patch code updated. Don't try to run your map by double-clicking it; you won't be able to.
