  Pick a good brand that you like and will wear.;
,  Your cleats should be tight.  Not so tight that they hurt your feet, but they should be close fitting.  If your cleats are too big then you could have a hard time kicking the ball properly. 

,  When you are standing, feel where your toe is in the shoe.  Your toe should be very close to the top.  It should be either at the top or there should be just a very little bit of space. 

,  If they feel good then they are probably a good size for you!
