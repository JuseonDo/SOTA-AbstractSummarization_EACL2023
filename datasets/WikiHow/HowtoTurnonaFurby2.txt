 This will expose the battery compartment., It should come completely off., Make sure they are all facing the correct way, as they will be standing up in the compartment., Make sure that the two little tabs are in their right place. If they aren't, the battery compartment won't screw in correctly., To do this, press and hold down Furby's tongue switch. As you do this, switch Furby's on/off switch to the "on" position. If your Furby wasn't new in box, then there is no need to do this.,
