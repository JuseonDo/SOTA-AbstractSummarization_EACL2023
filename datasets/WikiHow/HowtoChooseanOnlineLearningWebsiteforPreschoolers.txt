 Look at every website you can find. Read books, talk to parents, teachers, and librarians.
 Is it working for them? Is it entertaining?,,, Are they colorful? They shoudn't be black and white, but rather than that you should see greens, blues, pinks, reds, oranges, yellows, purples, browns, blacks (some), whites (splashes here and there), grays, and peaches. You should see at least 3 different shades of each color., Is it easy to do by yourself? Will preschoolers be able to do it themselves? The key to being able to do this is clear directions, directions read aloud, and pictures to reinforce the directions and lessons., Will children be able to stay on this for at least 30 minutes? Are there a variety of activities that are age appropriate to keep children entertained?, The site content should contain a variety of educational subjects such as the following:

Letters of the alphabet
Numbers and counting
Shapes
Colors and drawing
Music and songs to sing along with
Parts of the body
Personal hygiene like washing, brushing hair and teeth and establishing a healthy routine and habits
Learning the days of the week, month and seasons of the year
Teaching children about healthy eating

,,, Ask them if it was fun, see how long they can stay on it, and reinforce what they have learned to see if it was effective., If you do, will you be able to pay for it? Remember that there are plenty of excellent educational sites that you do not have to pay to use.
