 Make sure the pencil is sharp enough to draw on the paper lightly.;
, Is there a hidden mole? Maybe there's a crooked tooth. These details make the picture more amazing.
 Or the hairline. Or the body. Whichever one is easier for you.
 Make sure you're facial features are aligned and they are still drawn lightly.
 Small strokes for the eyelashes, careful drawing for the nose. When you're done majority of the detail, just fill in the rest carefully. You wouldn't want scribbly lips, would you?

, Slowly draw the outline of the hairline starting from the head, downwards. When you're done the simple outline, fill in each hair VERY carefully.
 Draw the body very carefully, using small, short strokes. Then draw what the person is wearing. Maybe he's wearing a tuxedo, or maybe she has a bow in her hair. These all contribute to a detailed portrait.
 Focus on where the light is coming from.Then draw shadow accordingly.
 When you have completed EVERYTHING!! Sign your signature in the bottom left corner.
