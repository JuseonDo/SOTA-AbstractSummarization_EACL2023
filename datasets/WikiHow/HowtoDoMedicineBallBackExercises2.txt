 You will need to be in an area where there is a hard floor and lots of space. Make sure the room is fairly empty and that breakable items are out of the way.


The ceiling will need to be fairly high in order to do this exercise. You may want to consider going outside and doing it in your driveway.
This is a standing exercise, so it's not necessary to use a mat.
 Stand straight with your feet set shoulder width apart. Keep your shoulders back and let your arms relax.
 Keep your knees straight, but not locked. Your arms should be straight as well.
 Keep your arms straight and your core tight. This will help to work your abs as well, which is a bonus!

, Take a deep breath and then slam the ball into the ground as hard as you can. Try not to hunch your shoulders when you do this.
 Attempt to do two or three sets of 10. This is an intermediate level, upper back exercise, which utilizes your core for a great full-body, multi-joint workout.
