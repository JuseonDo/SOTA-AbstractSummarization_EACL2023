After synching your financial accounts, Mint.com will recognize bills you frequently pay and suggest setting reminders for them. You can also set new reminders by clicking the orange button on the top right corner. Note: This is a very helpful tool to get notified about your upcoming bill; however, users cannot pay their bills directly from Mint.com.



Mint.com pulls all your transactions in one place and categorizes them automatically. However, sometimes the program does not recognize uncommon transactions, and you would have to categorize them manually.
