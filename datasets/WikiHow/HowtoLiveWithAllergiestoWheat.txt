Ingredients produced directly from wheat include flour (white and whole wheat), semolina, bulgur, barley, and rye. Other ingredients like vegetable starch and vegetable gum often have gluten in them.
Consult websites like www.glutenfreeliving.com and Celiac.com for reliable lists of products that have gluten. Organizations that provide additional information and support for people with Celiac disease or gluten allergies and sensitivity include the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness and the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America.;
, Pay special attention to foods that you were accustomed to consuming.


Some of the most common food products that include gluten are: bread, pasta, beer, cereal, pizza, crackers, baked goods, and soy sauce.
 Check for these on all food products you buy.


Some more obscure gluten-rich names or ingredients are durum, frumento, gelatinized starch, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein.



These include all fruits and vegetables, corn, potatoes, rice, milk, eggs, nuts, meat, fish, and most oils.
 Many of these are especially designed for people with Celiac disease, while others are natural products that can easily replace wheat.


Substitutes for flour include sorghum and cornstarch. Common non-gluten grains include buckwheat and quinoa. For cooking, look to products like xantham gum to use as thickeners or binders. In addition, there are a variety of breads, pastas, flours, and cereals specifically marketed as gluten-free.
 Many stores, especially health food outlets, now have entire gluten-free sections.
 Build up a library of recipes for all types of meals, snacks, and desserts.
