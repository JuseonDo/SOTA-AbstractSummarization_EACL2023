Be sure to slightly minimize the iTunes window so you can open up a second window.;

Once the Macintosh HD window is open, locate the folder in which the movie file is located.
The actual location of the movie file itself can vary based on where you originally saved the file.
The default location for saved movies on a Mac will be the "Movies" folder, which can be found on the left menu bar of the Macintosh HD window.



You can tell when the iTunes window has been highlighted as there will be a blue outline around the library's window.



Depending on the file's size, the movie will appear under the "Movies" category in the iTunes library once it is finished loading.
