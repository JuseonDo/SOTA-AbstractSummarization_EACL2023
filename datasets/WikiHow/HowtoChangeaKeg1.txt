 You'll know that your keg is empty if you open the faucet of the tap and either very frothy beer comes out or none does.;
, Some kegs will have a CO2 tank that provides pressure inside the keg to help dispense beer. The gas also helps the beer hold its natural carbonation. If the system you're using has a CO2 line, turn it off.
 Grasp the coupler and rotate it counter-clockwise until it won't move anymore, usually just a half-turn.
