Repeat the most important content to be retained in the beginning, middle and end of your presentation.



Knowing whether the audio/visual training will be shown to a group or made available on demand for individual listeners will help you tailor the program and will make a better connection with the audience.
Balance video quality with the need to deliver the presentation with minimal interruption from buffering if video files will be streamed online.
Keep the language level appropriate to the audience in terms of reading level and education.



Consider subtitling or close captioning your audio/video presentation or adding audio enhancements for visually impaired persons.



Each speaker should have his or her own microphone and sound should be monitored with headsets throughout recording for "live-to-tape" presentations.

Long video segments will lose the viewer's attention.
Break long audio visual training presentations into shorter chapters.



If your presenters are not actors or professional narrators, rehearse with them until they are as comfortable as possible on camera or with the microphone.
 They should be visually appealing, but should not try to present too much information at once.

Consider developing a web group, chat room or other means for learners to share questions and comments. This sense of community can bring some benefits of classroom learning to your audio/visual training.
Make your audio/video training as updatable as possible.
