 If you can here clicks on the line, such as click, click, click, or hums, whines and buzzing noises, then it's possible that the electric fence is creating interference. Other possible sources of interference with the phone line include fluorescent lamps, a light dimmer or electric motors. If you have other possible sources of interference, don't discount them as they'll all need to be investigated.
 Check the phone line to see if the sounds are still happening. If they're not, it's a fair bet that the fence is the cause of interference. If you can still hear interference noise, check for other appliances around the house or yard., If you cannot find them, call your telecommunications provider to help you identify their location., Such sections are more likely to cause interference than other sections., The optimal amount should be about 2 amps per kilometre of energised fence line. If it's higher, then it will be prone to interfere. Try to find the source of it being higher, such as deteriorating insulators or live wires touching the ground.

The fence will work better if mains supply is fed to the fence in the middle of your farm or yard, well away from phone lines.
