 Saying that you are very interested in this particular website can be very convincing.;
, You can also become a member in technology forums and ask the users for an invitation. (Technology forums are more likely to have members that are already in an invite-only site).
 There are many sites out there which can invite you to members-only websites in exchange with some comments on their articles or subscribing to their newsletter.
 E.g. if you are already a faceparty user and want to enter Tuenti, ask a Tuenti user to invite you. Promise to invite back.
, Some sites (i.e InterNations) allow non-members to send an email to the owners of the site explaining why they think they should be part of this private community.
 If you cannot find an invitation by following the previous steps and still need one, there are sites that actually sell invitations.
