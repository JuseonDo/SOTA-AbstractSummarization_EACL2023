 Make sure your ballet tights are clean without any stains or ladders. Make sure your leotard is clean and fits correctly.;
, Ask your dance teacher how to do this, as he or she will know what kind of ballet shoes you have.
 For an exam this will probably be natural, with perhaps just a bit of foundation, blusher and mascara, or it may be none at all.
 This will probably be a brush, comb, bobby pins, clips, grips, a bun net and some gel or hairspray.
 It will probably need to be in a neat bun, at the back in the middle of the head, with all hair away from your face, but ask your teacher to be sure. If you don't think you can do it yourself, make sure someone else will be there to do it.
,,,, Look confident in what you are doing, even if you don't feel it.
 Say Good morning/afternoon, curtsy if your teacher has said you should, and smile calmly at all times.
