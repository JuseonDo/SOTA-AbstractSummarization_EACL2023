hand-down: small children don’t stay small for long, so they typically outgrow their clothes before they wear them out so consider reusing them for the next child.

@summary

 Craker suggests:


turning old clothing into a quilt or rags;
saving empty plastic jars, egg cartons, and fabric scraps for kids’ craft projects;
repurposing old cans in your garden.;
, But also consider recycling yourself:


use old cans or glass jars to store nails, screws, and other odds and ends;
clean out plastic containers to reuse for food storage.
One thrifty/green secret Craker shares in her book, thanks to a reader’s tip: take old jeans and make them into pillow covers, using the pocket to hold a tooth for the tooth fairy!

, Most Amish families have at least half a dozen kids, so they naturally clothe the younger ones with hand-me-downs. If your family is slightly smaller, find other families you can trade with, or at the very least, donate used clothing to charity instead of them hitting the landfill.
 For example, Craker interviewed Ella Yoder, a fabulously thrifty Amish woman, who among other things uses gallon metal apple butter cans (minus both ends) as seedling protectors in her garden.
