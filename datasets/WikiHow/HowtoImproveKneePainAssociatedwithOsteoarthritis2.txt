 There are even braces specifically designed with osteoarthritis in mind.
 You might want a discrete brace that could be hidden under clothing, or you could want a more substantial brace where you're happy to sacrifice subtlety for greater protection.
 There are a number of knee brace manufacturers who all specialise in slightly different areas of the knee brace market - one manufacturer might specialise in elastic, pull up knee braces, for example. Chances are you'll want to find the best manufacturer for your chosen style and level of support.
 Different manufacturers require different measurements, so if you do decide to order a knee brace, have all three of these measurements ready - they could ask for any one of them, or all of them!

, With the knee brace ordered and worn, it should work to shift your weight off the most damaged portion of your knee - so you should experience an improvement in your knee pain even while carrying out your normal routine.
