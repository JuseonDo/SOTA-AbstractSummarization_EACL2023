 Skipping can also be cause by a worn chain, worn chainrings and worn sprockets.;
, Disconnect the rear brake and undo the axle nuts.
 The freewheel mechanism is contained inside the splined housing.
 The process may vary for this step by manufacturer and hub design. Shimano freehubs are held on by a hollow hex bolt inside the housing itself. Remove the bearings on either side before undoing the bolt.
, Check for any worn or broken parts, replace if necessary. The whole mechanism may need to be replaced if it is too worn or has other major damage.
, If there is still skipping, check for other possible sources of the problem or get a new freehub body or even a new hub.
