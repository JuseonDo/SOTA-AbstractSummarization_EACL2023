 Processed food should be avoided as far as possible. Processed food is devoid of real nutrition required for the body. One must also avoid all wrong stuff like chips, pizza, etc. This will help reduce cravings.;
, This is an interesting step towards avoiding the extra oil used while cooking. You could even try to kick off the calories by consuming a good amount of water. It helps in flushing out the toxins from the body. This further helps in burning out calories.
 Food filled with fiber should be included in the diet; it helps in the process of digestion. Healthy eating is healthy living. If you must indulge in junk food, then try to have a small portion of it. By doing this, you can eat your favorite food without feeling guilty.
 Try to maintain the balance with both good and bad food. A balanced eating habit along with a few hours of workout session could do wonders.
 Plan out a balanced food chart on the basis of health and nutrition. This could be an important step towards keeping a check on that extra dip of cheese and remaining healthy for the rest of life.
