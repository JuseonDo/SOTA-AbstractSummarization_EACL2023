 Attack one with a critical hit.Try fighting in third person view.
 Try not to run around, as this will attract more pigmen. Watch your step, as one miss step can send you plummeting into lava. Zombie pigmen are not affected by lava. Do not let them surround you.
 A knockback II enchanted sword is usually better for this, as if you run too far, you will be surrounded. Lead the pigman around in circles, hitting them. Do not wander too far, as you will likely attract other swarms.
 Collect the experience and whatever drops they may leave, like rotten flesh or a gold nugget.
