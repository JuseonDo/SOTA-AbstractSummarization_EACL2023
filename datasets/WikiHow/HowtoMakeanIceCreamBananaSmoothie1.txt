 Try to use fresh, ripe bananas, if you can. If you like your smoothie extra thick, frozen bananas instead. Cutting the bananas up first will make it easier for them to blend.;
, The ice cubes will help make your smoothie thicker. If you are using frozen bananas, you do not need to add the ice cubes.
 You can add all of the ice cream into the blender now, or save the last scoop to use as a topping later., For a healthier option, consider using honey instead.
 There should be no chunks or lumps of banana or ice. From time to time, you may want to open the blender, and use a spatula to push the smoothie down the walls of the blender. This will help everything mix together more evenly.
 If you saved the last scoop of ice cream, now is the time to add it.
