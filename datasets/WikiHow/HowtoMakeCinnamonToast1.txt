 Take the butter out of the refrigerator before you perform the other steps. Heat the butter up in the microwave for 30 seconds or let it sit out in room temperature until you're ready to use it.;
, Stir together the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon until they are mixed thoroughly.
 Anything that can have a broad sliced surface to hold melted butter will work. It shouldn't be very stale, but slightly stale bread temporarily improves with heating., Take out or make however many slices you like and toast them. If making slices to toast simultaneously, make them about equally thick so they finish toasting simultaneously.
 Right after the toast finishes, set it on a plate and butter it. Slice a pat of butter (or whatever you use) onto each slice of toast, and let it melt a bit. Smear the butter with the knife so its evenly distributed.
 The butter will make it stick.
 Try serving with milk.
