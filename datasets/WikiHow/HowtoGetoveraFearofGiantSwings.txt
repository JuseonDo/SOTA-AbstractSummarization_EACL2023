 Here are some quick drills:


Try to hit a foam cube from the foam pit hanging in the air.
Ask your coach or a friend to hold a mat in the air, and try to kick it.
Try to do a timer, or a fly away into the pit.;
,, If you are more advanced, try a kip, and if you are still starting out, practice a pullover.
 Ask her/him to spot you over from a high giant swing, keep thinking of it as really big swings. Here are some tips:


Have straight legs and pointed toes.
Swing like you were swinging before.
Cover your ears.
Don't pike.
Look at the bar.
Stay open, don't be afraid to fall from a handstand.
, Don't forget a spot! (It should be your coach or a high level gymnast.)

, (Use a normal bar, no straps.)

, Here are some more tips:


Lean backwards in the handstand, so you can do your backward giant swing.
Don't forget straight legs, and pointed toes!
Fall like it's from a normal tap swing.
 Get your coach to spot you. This time it should just be a good coach. Ask her/him to spot you from a cast to handstand.
 Before you know it, you'll attempt it, and get it on your own!
