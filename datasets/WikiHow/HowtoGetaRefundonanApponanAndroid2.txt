 15 minutes after installation, you cannot apply for a refund directly in the Google Play app on your device. Instead, you need to request for a refund from the developer of the app.
 Using any browser on your computer, head to the Google Play website. If you’re not yet logged in, do so by entering your Gmail email address and password on the fields provided.
 This will open a small context menu with the options “My orders,” “Settings,” and “Device manager.”

,, A menu icon will appear next to the app’s name.
 Only one option will appear when you click on the icon.
,, You can do this by clicking on the to the left of the reason of your choice.
 Your request will then be submitted to the app developer.


This method does not guarantee a refund. It totally depends on the developer to accept your request. Hence, it is always suggested to view the ratings and read the reviews of the app before purchasing one.
