@article
 List them down and turn it over to someone whom you think is capable of accomplishing those tasks.;
, Initially, you need to provide as many details as possible to make sure that your employee produces the required output.
 You can also ask your employee to draft a process on how he/she thinks this task can be done more efficiently.
 Let them discover new ways to handle that task.
 At this level, you already trust that they know what they’re doing and expect regular updates. You’re already past micromanaging.
 Show them that you’re involved in their project.
 Feedback is important to your team. Criticisms will teach them flexibility as they learn to adapt to different demands.
 Let him/her make a decision that you fully support.
 It’s possible that you’ll only get a couple of progress reports and the last one you’ll receive is the finished output.
 At this level, you have already trained and developed superstars. You can now feel more at ease in running your business. And guess what? It all began when you started to delegate.
