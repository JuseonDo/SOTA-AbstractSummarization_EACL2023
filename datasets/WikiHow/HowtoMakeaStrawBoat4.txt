, You'll use this to make a crow's nest. Just fold it around and tape it., Then cut a small square out of the side, but don't cut the last side.,,
Fold it into a tiny square by folding it over again and again and again and again.
Once you've got the thick square, snip two tiny rectangles into it. Be careful, you don't you may accidentally snip the ladder rungs apart.
Unfold the ladder carefully. It should be a long ladder patterned thing. Tape one end of it to the bottom of the ship, and the other end to the crow's nest, just beneath the door.
 If it floats, you're good! If it doesn't float, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tinfoil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges.,
Cut a circle and tape it onto the top of the straw. This is your steering wheel.
Cut a tiny slit in the straw. Then, cut a piece of paper big enough for a table.
Fold the straw back a little, exposing the slit. Put in the paper and let go of the straw.
