 Camps are the main places where cats eat, sleep, and socialize. Camps can be dens, for instance, a volcano den for FireClan, or an underground den for ShadowClan. (Also use the music "deep blue". Another good music alternative is "Mt. Shiveer"). If you are a non-member or don't want to dedicate your den to a clan, consider getting a rarely visited place such as Outback Imports, The Flag Shop, (Flag Shop is rather large), or even the clothing store or Chamber of Knowledge (Very, very, large and cool to look at as well). Too many people choose the bottom of Sarepia Forest for their territories making it crowded, but the top "treehouse like" part could be used. Territories such as Temple Of Zios are less crowded and easier to roleplay in. Consider territories that are along your camp (if it's not a den of course!) such as Temple Of Zios with Chamber of Knowledge as your camp, or the top part of Sarepia Forest if the Flag Shop is your camp.;
, Shoji Screens and pillows are good for the dens, for the fresh kill pile get all red plushies and for wild animals to "Hunt" just put certain plushies about, no purple or green plushies and no rhinos.
 etc.
 _ Members!!" (if you have no members then don't say anything)

, A Fox Hat or Raccoon Hat, (found at Epic Wonders) Spike Collar, and if you can a Rare Tiara (black with a red gem) makes you like more "leader-ish".
 They also do jobs such as changing the elders bedding). Warriors, Deputies, Leaders, Queens, (nursing mothers or she-cats who help in the nursery) and Elders (retired warriors). Before you make any cat a warrior give them a quick training session on how to hunt and fight. When you find a loyal cat who seems like a good leader make them deputies.
 Roleplay clan life, hunting, fighting, births, deaths, patrolling territory.
, You have a clan that is hopefully thriving. Have fun with your new clan!
