You can create a pattern for the head of the riding toy by drawing the shape of the head freehand on cardboard or poster board. Optionally, enlarge, photocopy and print an illustration you want to use for a pattern.
Include a long neck on the stick horse pattern.;
,,, You will now have 2 identical pieces.
 Leave the bottom of the neck open to insert the dowel.
