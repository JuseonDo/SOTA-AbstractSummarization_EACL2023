AT&T can unlock your mobile phone if you meet specific eligibility requirements. You must have had active AT&T service for at least 90 days, your account must be current on payments, your phone model must be available from other service providers or companies, and an unlock code must be available from the manufacturer.
Apple iPhones cannot be unlocked; however they have the ability to function overseas using AT&T's international roaming feature.



Prepaid SIM cards can usually be purchased from stores in airports, department stores, or from phone merchants. You may want to ask the vendor salesperson about the rates and applicable fees for your prepaid SIM card.
