 However, instead of adding any melted white chocolate, use icing (frosting) instead. You have a choice of either dribbling icing over each truffle to look like custard, or simply using the icing as glue, to keep the berry and leaf formation in place. Experiment with the appearance to decide which pleases you most. If making up the icing to drizzle over the truffle, make as follows.
 If using an electric hand mixer, this will take about 1 minute.
 Continue to beat.
 Beat until the topping that forms is thick and a shiny white colour.
 Allow it to drizzle down the sides of the truffle to look like oozing custard.
 Place in mini paper cases if desired.
