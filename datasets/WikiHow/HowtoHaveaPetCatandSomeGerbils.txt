 It doesn't have to be a large area, but it does need to be inaccessible to the cat when necessary (for example, a bedroom with a locking door). This is the place where the gerbils will be allowed out of their enclosure if needed.;
, It can be as simple as a glass terrarium with toys and a tight mesh lid, or as complex as a "gerbil playground" made of clear PVC pipe.
 Your cat will probably enjoy watching the gerbils, but be sure to discipline it if it shows an inclination to attack.
 The best way to do this is to put the gerbils in a smaller cat-proof home, and shut them in the cat-free zone. You can also put your cat outside (assuming this is safe), or restrict it to a large room (make sure to provide food, water, toys and a litter box).
, It is more likely to ignore the gerbils entirely if you provide it with a variety of fun toys, playtime or other attention.
