 You'll want to get moist, shiny, and bright skin and firm flesh.
, Carefully snap and crack the crab's leg to get the meat. Just be sure not to damage the meat. Use pliers to remove it from the bones.,, Lay the fillet on the cutting board. Take your knife and carefully slice between the skin and flesh. Use your free hand to hold the fish in place - so that it doesn't move with the cuts., You'll want even portions of sashimi. Cut off large thin slices from the fillet. Fold each piece over as you go. Use only one knife motion across the fish fillets., Place it on the serving plate.,,, Wasabi is an extremely hot mustard paste and should be optional for use.
