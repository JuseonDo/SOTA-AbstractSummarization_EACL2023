 For a full tang knife, there are two pieces of handle, one on each side. Cut and sand the pieces at the same time to ensure that both sides are symmetrical.
 Drill the holes for the rivets on each side. Avoid getting epoxy on the blade, as it can be difficult to remove. Place it in a vise and let it dry overnight.
 Insert the rivets, leaving about an extra 1/8‚Äù sticking out each side, and peen them with a ball-peen hammer. File the rivets down and sand the handle.
