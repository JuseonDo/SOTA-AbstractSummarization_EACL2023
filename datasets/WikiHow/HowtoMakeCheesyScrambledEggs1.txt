 Place a pan on the stove, then turn the heat on to medium low. Once the pan is hot, add the butter. Let the butter melt slowly.;
, This will be enough for one person. Do not add any cheese, salt, or any other seasonings into the bowl yet.
 Take the pan by the handle, and tilt it around until the melted butter covers the entire surface.Try to get some of the butter up the inside sides of the pan as well.
, Try to use a silicone spatula instead of a metal or wood one. Eggs are less likely to stick to silicone than to wood. A silicone spatula also won't scratch your pan up like a metal one would., The eggs will continue to cook, even after you remove them from heat. If you wait too long, your eggs will turn out over-cooked and dry.
 Grated cheese melts quickly and easily. The heat from the still-cooking eggs will be just enough for this. Keep stirring the eggs until the cheese has melted.
 At this point, you can season them with some salt and/or pepper. You can also garnish them with some chopped chives.
