 Your vacuum cleaner should have a 'wand' to help with that and get to the nooks and crannies. If you have the right type of camera bag, wash it as well. Animal hair can be very pervasive, so if you have pets, you will probably want to be that much more vigilant about it.;

 The above image does not and because of that, he is making it easier for dirt to get into his camera.
 You can find a little suction tool in the baby section that will help with that and is very difficult to break (nearly impossible).

 They, for obvious reasons, get very up close and personal with your camera body and will definitely introduce dirt onto your sensor if not kept clean.
