 The doctor might prescribe an antibiotic medicine to prevent infection. If you were bitten or scratched by an animal, you will need to make sure that the animal didn't have rabies, a dangerous virus.
 Your parent will need to check your medical records and be sure that you have had a tetanus shot recently.
 An infection happens when there are too many germs for your body's white blood cells to handle. Infected wounds may hurt, look red and swollen, and contain pus, which is a thick yellowish or greenish liquid. If your cut, scratch, or abrasion looks infected, you should talk to someone. You may need to see a doctor for antibiotics to get rid of the infection.
