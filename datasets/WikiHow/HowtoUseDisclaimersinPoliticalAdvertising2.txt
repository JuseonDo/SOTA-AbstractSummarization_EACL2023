Keep this type of disclaimer simple. For example, it could say "Paid for by the Clark for Congress Committee" or "Paid for by Mary Martin, candidate for President."

,


Write or say something like "Paid for by the Committee for Freedom and approved by Clark for Congress."
Indicate that the candidate approved the message any time a third party runs a political ad that the candidate does support and authorize.



Identify who paid for the ad, include a physical address or website address for that group or individual and state that the communication was not authorized or paid for by the candidate or his/her committee.
Fit the entire disclaimer into one sentence. For example, "Paid for by the Committee for Frogs (www.frogs.org) and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee" will cover you.
 For example, "Paid for by the Florida Republican Party."


Do not include any approvals or authorizations in your disclaimer if you are a political party running a general ad about an issue or a group of issues and the ad is not meant to support a specific candidate.
Include the authorization disclaimer if the political party's ad is on behalf of a specific candidate. For example, "Paid for by the Florida Democratic Party and authorized by the Clark for Congress Committee."

Make sure it is typed in a font and size that is clearly readable. The FEC recommends a 12-point type size and ink that sets it apart from the background of the page or surface.
Put the disclaimer on the front of a single-sided communication or a billboard. If your political ad is several pages long, it can be placed anywhere.



Use the voice of the candidate any time he or she has paid for or approved the message.
Include an image of the candidate on television ads.
,


Use a simple statement, such as "The Committee for Frogs is responsible for this ad."
