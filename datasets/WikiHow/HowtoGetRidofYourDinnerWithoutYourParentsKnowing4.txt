 It will make a mess and if your parents realize that you did it on purpose, they may get angry.
 Go ahead and appear to be about to tuck into the meal.
 Pretend you're so engaged in telling them a story about your day that your enthusiasm gets the better of you, as you press the plate or bowl and tip it over or even onto the floor.
 Realize that you may be offered a second serving, so have a ready excuse, such as "Oh no, I couldn't take that food away from everyone else. This is my bad, I'll go make a sandwich."
