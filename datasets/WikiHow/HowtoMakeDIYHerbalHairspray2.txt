 Either heat the water in your tea kettle with water or boil water in a pot on the stove.
 Measure sugar precisely--too much will make your spray too sticky, but too little will make it ineffective.
 Mix well, dissolving the sugar into the boiling water.


Allow bowl to sit for up to an hour or until the water cools.
 Consider going with a few scents in order to create an extremely unique spray. Mix beforehand to ensure you like the aroma (in a smaller cup).
 Make sure the spray bottle is firmly standing on a flat surface so it doesn’t tip over. Hint--ask a friend to hold the bottle in place as your pour.
 You don’t want to over pour or else you may have a sticky mess.
 Before each use, shake the bottle to evenly re-distribute ingredients.
