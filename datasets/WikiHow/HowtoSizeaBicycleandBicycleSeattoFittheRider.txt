 Take a pair of pants that fit and do not drag on the ground. Measure the seam that is on the inside of the leg, from the crotch stitching to the bottom of the leg. That measurement is the inseam.;
, A properly fitting bicycle will measure 1-2 inches / 2.5–5cm longer than the inseam measurement. Standing flat on the ground, the bar should almost touch the crotch.
 This proper seat measurement should be 1-2 inches/ 2.5–5cm shorter than the inseam measurement. The leg should almost be fully extended, without locking the knee.
 An alternative seat measurement may be performed by the rider sitting on the bike and pedaling until one foot can extend almost as far as it is able to go.
