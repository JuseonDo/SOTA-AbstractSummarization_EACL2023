 The fine grains will easily slip through when you tip the shaker upside down to fill and the tape will prevent this from happening.
, To make this easier, use a small funnel to transfer from the original container to the shaker. A funnel can be purchased from the store or one can be made simply from paper (see How to make a cone or funnel from paper).
 Leave enough space for movement of the grains through the holes.
 Tip the shakers back up the right way. Done!
