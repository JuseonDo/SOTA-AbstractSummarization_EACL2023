 This keyboard shortcut will open a new terminal window with a command prompt in all Linux desktop environments.


If you don’t have the current root password, see this method.
If you’re not using a desktop environment, you’re already at a command prompt, so just continue to the next step.;
,, When the password is accepted, you’ll be brought back to the command prompt as the root user.


If you type the password incorrectly, just run su again and retry.
Passwords are case-sensitive.
 A new line will open beneath the command that says, “Enter new UNIX password:”

, The password you type will not appear on the screen, but you’ll be prompted to type it a second time to confirm.
 You will see a message that says “password updated successfully.”

, This will log you out of the root account.
