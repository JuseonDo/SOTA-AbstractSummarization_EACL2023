 Do not create a new backup now, or it will override the most recent version of your backup file and you'll lose the deleted messages in the backup, too.


Open WhatsApp and tap Settings.
Tap Chats and Chat backup.
Look at the Last backup date and time. If the given backup would include the messages you want to recover, keep going with this method. If not, try the other methods.;
, You need to remove the entire app first before you can restore deleted messages.
,, Then enter your mobile phone number.
 The next screen will notify you that a message backup is found for your phone. Click on “Restore” and wait for the recovery process to finish.


By default, WhatsApp automatically creates a backup of all your message threads every day at 2 o’clock in the morning. The latest backup saved there will be the one that loads up.
