 Doing so encourages him to get his ride over with and run home, creating a barn sour horse. Also check your surroundings and make sure you are not too close to another object on your left hand side before dismounting.
 Do not keep your left foot in your left stirrup, this harms the horse's back muscles, and could end up getting you dragged by your horse if he decides to go for a stroll.
 Do not kick him.
 This is so your knees do not end up absorbing the shock of you hitting the ground.
 If you want to loosen the girth (only a hole or so) do so now on the left side.
 Walk around the front of him to your right stirrup. Roll this one up also.
