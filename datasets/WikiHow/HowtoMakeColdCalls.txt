 Identify an organization that you would like to help;
, Make sure you have a project plan that includes the activity, fundraiser, or event, the date and location. Have all the details planned out so there are no surprises for you or a donor. If they give once to a successful event, they are likely to give again.
 Use their web site to find a phone number and possibly a contact person for community contributions/donations

, If you have a number for a contact person call them directly. If not, call the main line and when the secretary answers tell her you name, where you are from (i.e. school group, etc.) and ask to speak to someone about a possible donation.
 Then explain that you are working on a project/event to benefit your chosen cause. Explain a little bit about what the organization does and then about your project and how it will benefit the cause.
