, These may include weekly worship, meetings and holidays.
 It's important to talk to someone, but can be hard to find someone who will listen without judgement, while also understanding what losing faith means.
 Tell them you must sort it out yourself in your own head.
 Resentment and anger toward your god, religion or religions in general is normal, but best not shared with some people.
 Probably the most basic, but vital steps to lessen the pain.
 These could be your friends and family, and yourself. It can also be smaller things like your work, pets, home and small family traditions.
 Not everyone is happy with their job, or thinks of it as important, but work doesn’t have to be a job. Charity, political and voluntary work is worthwhile and helps expand your social network.
 Most people don’t end up being “what I want to be when I grow up”, but there’s no reason why you can re-awaken some of these dreams, in the form of a hobby, training course, voluntary work, or career or lifestyle change.
 If you are working over-time so you can take your family on an expensive holiday, spend the evenings with your kids and take them on a camping holiday 10 miles (16 km) away instead.
 You easily can uncover the true, hidden foundations and origins of the most important guidance you found in your former religion. It can be found by studying the history of the religions that man has invented, and why; such as found in Christian author Houston Smith's The World's Religions. Then come back to your life, in the world today, and study the modern synthesis of those positive, early motivations, such as are found in the current philosophy of Humanism. There you can gain steadfast strength, self esteem, purpose, and compassion beyond what was attainable in your former life as a believer in the ethereal, the ever-changing, and the inexplicable.
