 Look for a smart container that comes with a handle for easy carrying, often known as a cleaning carry-all or a cleaning utility carry-all.;
, It should be easily accessible if required.
 For example:


Blot a red wine stain on the carpet with club soda and paper towels. Or sprinkle salt over it.
Vacuum up spilled ash on the carpet and deodorize immediately with a few shakes of baking soda .
Soak up the smells of smokers outdoors with a bowl of vinegar near the door entrance or open windows.
Scrape dip and other food off the floor and sponge with the vinegar or stain remover to remove the coloring and odor.
