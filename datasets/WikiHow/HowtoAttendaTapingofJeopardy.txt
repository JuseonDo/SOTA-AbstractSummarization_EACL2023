,, Jeopardy! tapes at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. If you live far away, book a plane ride to California in advance, and choose an affordable hotel that's near the studio. Your trip may require an overnight stay, so pack clothing and other materials that you'll want a few days before the trip, if necessary.
, If you arrive late, you risk not being able to get into the studio. Your seating location will depend on where you are in line, so arrive early to get the best seats. Make sure you have your tickets with you, otherwise, you won't be admitted into the studio.
 Have fun watching the show in-person, and follow all instructions you're given by the show's staff.
