, After your get out of the shower, squeeze the water out of your hair with a towel. You want your hair to remain damp, but you don't want it dripping water. Be careful not to over-dry your hair or you won't achieve as tight of curls.
 Use a gel or mousse that provides medium to firm hold. Rub it all the way in from your roots to your ends. Styling products also work to keep your hair moisturized and damp throughout the rolling process.










Comb a section of hair about as wide as your roller forward over your face. Grab your hair between your fingers and hold the piece up like a Mohawk. Wrap the ends of your hair over the roller. Make sure you are rolling the way you wish your hair to curl.
Hold the roller and your hair tightly and rotate the curler until it touches your scalp. Secure the roll tightly with a pin or the clip attached to the roller.
, Drying times will differ based on the thickness and length of your hair. Remove a roller to test for damp hair. Keep drying your hair if the hair in the roller is still wet to the touch.
 Work slowly to avoid tangling your hair.
 Set the curls into place using your fingers. Apply hairspray to lock in the style.
