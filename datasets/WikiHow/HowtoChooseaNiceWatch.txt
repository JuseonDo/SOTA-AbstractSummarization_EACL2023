 Analog? Digital? Both?;
, Do you want a metal band? Rubber? Polyurethane?

, Under $100? Under $1000?

, In other words, get one that has quartz or mechanical movement. The first uses a battery and a vibrating crystal while the latter one uses a wound spring and a gear system. Some watches have a movement that is charged by the movement of the wrist, this will keep the watch wound or charged indefinitely whilst you wear it. Seiko has quartz movements that do this called "Kinetic" and mechanical movements that do this are called "Automatic" .
 For example if you want a sophisticated, sleek look you might want to find a sleek, thin, long silver watch. For more of the punk/rock star look, you could get one with a very wide webbing or leather band. For the classy, preppy look, a metal analog watch would be nice.
 You can't really tell by looking at one, but you can check its ratings by the manufacturer. Rolex, Tag Heuer, Rado, and other well known brands are very well made. Check the manufacturer to make sure they have a reputation of good watches, if expensive. At the lower price range some good manufacturers are Seiko, Casio, Swatch, Timex, and Orient.
 Unless you see a marking for meters (ex. 30 meters, 100 meter, etc...) assume that it cannot be worn in water.
 You can also choose an automatic, this is a totally mechanic watch that winds itself. You can get affordable automatics from Orient
