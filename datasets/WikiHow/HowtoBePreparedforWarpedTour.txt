, Camera, sunblock, money, cell phone, Sharpie, etc.
 You'll be able to start getting used to the place.
 or else they'll trash it.
 No black shirts (that'll absorb the heat). Shorts, not skirts! It gets really hot and you're going to be sweating.
 Wear something really comfortable. You're going to be walking all day. Vans or Converse always work.
 People might try to steal something from it so be very careful!

,, If you don't want to get into one then move aside or get closer to where there are no people.
 Bring 2 or 3 bottles of it! Make sure to put it in the freezer overnight so it'll be nice and cold when you're at Warped. Don't open the bottles! or the security will throw it away.

 They'll get annoyed and they probably won't like you. Be extremely nice and they'll give you more attention.
