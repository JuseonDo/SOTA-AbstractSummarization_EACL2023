For cultural or urban tourism, it is best to fly between major cities, as bus routes are slow and unreliable. Options such as the Mercosur Air Pass and the Visit South America Airpass allow travelers to fly around Latin America at reduced rates.
For budget travelers, bus travel is easiest and cheapest, and will allow you to reach more remote areas.



Although most areas are safe for travelers, there are pockets where it is inadvisable to visit or stay.



Because air conditioning, hot water, and meals are less common at hotels and hostels in Latin America than in other regions of the world, it is best to investigate details and included amenities ahead of time.



It is common for police, border guards, and bus and taxi drivers to attempt to overcharge.
