these are also known as "door speakers", "vocal speakers", "6 by 5" or "6 by 9" and more.

@summary
make sure your 4-channel amp can play them all without being so powerful that they damage the speakers.

@summary
connect all mids and highs with the same power and ground.

@summary
connect all speakers through the adjacent speakers that are pre-wired through the car.
@article
 If you're trying to install more than what your car originally came with, the same rules should be applied to those of subs.
 Because most speakers are rated to 8 ohms, you can generally connect many speaker to one amp without any problems.
 All cars have pre-wired powers and grounds that go through the doors and the back dash. It would be foolish to run multiple wires through your door and dash to play multiple speakers with such low wattage.
 Just make sure the power and ground are positioned properly throughout the process.
