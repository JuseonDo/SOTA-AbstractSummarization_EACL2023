@summary
get in line with the runway you are going to land on.

@summary
descend to an altitude of 5000 to 3000 feet.

@summary
,

@summary
once at the correct altitude, gather the following information.

@summary
with that information you should be able to complete the following sum (note that the division sign is substituted by a forward slash /)

@summary
distance from runway / your speed = answer x 60 = time in minutes to reach the runway.

,, It is best to pause the simulation at this point as the calculation may take some time to complete.


Your altitude (5000 to 3000 ft)
your speed (your speed will be in knots, convert to KM/H)
your distance (your distance will be in nautical miles, convert to KM) from the runway (which can be found on the GPS)

,
Your answer will give you the time in minutes to reach the runway.
With that answer complete the following sum.
Your altitude / time to reach runway = answer
Your answer for this sum will be a positive number, turn the answer to a negative number EG- if your answer was 1000 change it to -1000.
That negative number is the descent rate that you need to follow to get to the runway EG- if your answer was -1000, you need to descend at -1000 feet per minute to get to the runway.
