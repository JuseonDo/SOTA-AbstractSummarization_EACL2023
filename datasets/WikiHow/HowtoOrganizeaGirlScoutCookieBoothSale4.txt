@article
 Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies from Troop (Insert troop number here)?" If they say no or that they've already bought some, say "Thanks anyway. Have a nice day." If they say yes however, go on to the next step.
 Do not hover over them, but be ready in case they ask which cookies are the best or which are healthiest. Answer truthfully, and help them make their selection.
 Wait for the customer to hand you the money they owe you, then hand the cookies to them and say "Thank you, and have a nice day."
