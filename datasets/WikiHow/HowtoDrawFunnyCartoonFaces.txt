 For the face, you can draw:


Any type of round shape, it need not be a perfect circle.
A pear shape
An upside-down triangle
A quadrilateral - a square, rectangle, trapezium, etc.;
,, The eyes can be in the shape of


2 large circles
ovals
a curvy "M", like the one in "Mc Donalds".
 To make the mouth  look  funnier, add teeth by either drawing a straight horizontal line across the mouth and several vertical lines (forming a grid with 2 rows and many columns), or small squares sticking out inside the mouth from the upper side (roof of the mouth).


a large U-shaped curve
a triangle (preferably right-angled one)
an oval or circle
a rectangle
a straight line

,, If you want, you can also colour the picture with different, funky shades.
