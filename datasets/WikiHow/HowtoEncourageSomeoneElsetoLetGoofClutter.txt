 While you might be seeing "clutter", they are probably seeing "treasures", "pile of to-do paperwork", "things to get around to doing", "hobby items", "sports gear", etc. With this in mind, it can help you soften your irritability at facing them about it.;
, Try to paint a picture in words of how the pile ups around the house make you feel and what you think they might be doing in the way of stopping everyone in the house or workplace from doing more interesting, creative, or exciting things.
 You might have to come around to a way of thinking that lets them keep their stuff but not around you. Ask the other person to place their clutter in their personal space. If you don't have clearly delineated areas of personal space, consider making a few even if most areas are communal in nature. This way, they can clutter their heart away and you can keep away.
 It can be worrying to someone else when a sudden need to clear the decks occurs. Perhaps they wonder if they're next?! Reassure them by explaining that while you respect their belongings, clearing clutter improves the energy flow in the house and revives people's interest in the things they can see and find again. Help them to realize that a clutter-free existence is more fulfilling and engaging.
 Help them to find other "anchor-points", and overcome their insecurities.
 Aim to keep some areas of the house clutter-free at all times. Whenever anything threatens to clutter these areas, have a house rule that permits immediate removal of the clutter to a "clearance box" for the person to fetch and restore to its proper place, or dispose of.
 to help them get on with the job. Offer to pitch in and help as well, to try to ease the overwhelming nature of clutter-clearing. Promise to follow their direction though!
