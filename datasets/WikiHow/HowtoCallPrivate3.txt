If you have a Verizon iPhone, you won't be able to use your phone's settings to disable caller ID.
 It's in the same section of apps as Messages and FaceTime.
 If your carrier doesn't support this feature (as in the case of Verizon phones), you won't see this option here., It will turn white. From now on, the people you call won't be able to see your phone number.
