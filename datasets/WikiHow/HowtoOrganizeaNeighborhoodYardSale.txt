, Be sure to put your phone number and email address on your fliers.
 Go through a closet or a drawer anytime you get the chance, and as you pull out things for your sale, go right ahead and mark them with prices, using a marker and some tape. Put the items in a bag or the box, and tuck them away in the basement or the garage.
 Do this about a week to 10 days before the sale.
 Advertising is important here. People won't come to a garage sale with a lopsided piece of cardboard as a sign. Get a good piece of hardboard, and paint on your message in white.
, It is easier to say go to 9th and 10th rather than 1000 9th st, because now they have to look that up.
, If you need to set up on a driveway or yard, have everything near the door so you can run it all out and set it up quickly in the morning.
