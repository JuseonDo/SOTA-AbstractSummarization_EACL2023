 Cuddle snuggle and watch movies with them. Tell them you love them often and express your feelings to them. Believe it or not, they listen very well.


Hug your teddy before bed at night.;
,, Give them some of your food and be careful not to spill any on them.
 You can even make them their own bed. Don't forget to tuck them in!

, Listen to them too!

, Buy them baby clothes or build-a-bear clothes. Book Cellar also has some animal clothes. Pet clothes work too!

, Brush their teeth and bathe them. Change their clothes regularly. Do everything your mother/father would do for you.
 Invite your friends and their teddies too!

,, If you made a bed for your teddy to sleep on at night, and your teddy is either scared of storms, and you can see a storm coming, be sure to let your teddy sleep with you, or near you so that he/she feels safe!
