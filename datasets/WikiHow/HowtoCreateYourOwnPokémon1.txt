 It doesn't matter which one, as Pokémon can be any of these.;
, For example, ground, water, fire, flying, steel, electric, normal, etc. (check the Pokémon equivalent first, like lightning is electric and earth is ground in Pokémon)

, For example, you could choose a mountain lion and give it fire powers, such as adding fire to its tail-tip, the mane around its neck, or random fire strips on its back.
 For example, if you had a water pig, you could make the pig blue and give it fins on its back.
 This is a bit tricky, but it helps if you know the scientific names of both your animal and element.
, Make it have something to do with the type of animal and its element.
