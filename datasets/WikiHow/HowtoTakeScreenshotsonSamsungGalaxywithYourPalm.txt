To disable Palm Motion when you’re done taking screenshots and to avoid unintentional screen captures, just deactivate Palm Motion, click on “Palm swipe to capture,” and either toggle it off or uncheck the “Palm swipe to capture” box.
 Once you’ve decided to capture a particular display, slowly swipe your hand across to the other side of the screen, either left to right or right to left.
 If not, your screenshot might not be captured clearly or at all.
 You will see it on your device screen if the screen capture was successful.
 To see if the captured image is to your liking, pull down the notification bar, look for the item labelled “Screenshot captured,” and tap on it.


Alternatively, you can also go to the Gallery in your device, and check in the Screenshots folder.
