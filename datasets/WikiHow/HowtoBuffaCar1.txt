 Make sure the surface of the car is cool. This will help prevent soap stains from appearing on the car's surface.;
, Add water until the bucket is filled and the water is sudsy. Use only car wash-specific soaps. Read the soap packaging for the amount of soap to dispense.
 Remove the sponge, squeeze out about half of the water, place the sponge on the car and begin washing.



Start at the top of the car and work downward. Once the car has been completely cleaned, hose off all of the soap.
