@summary

 It should work with any carrot, but one about 7 and a half inches works best. It should be about 1 inch in diameter. It should also be fresh, and relatively straight.;
, Keep this piece for later, as you'll need it to create a plug.
 You can do this by hand, or if you have an electric drill you can use that as well. Take it slowly, be careful not to hurt yourself, and be careful not to drill through the sides of the carrot.
 You can dump most of it out, and run it under a tap if you need to.
 Be careful not to go any deeper, and gently slice it partially.
 There should be a triangular hole, and you should be able to see the sides of the carrot.
 This should make the end flat, and rectangular.
 Cut off slim pieces off the edges until it fits into the hole in the carrot. It should fit snugly, but you shouldn't have to hammer it into place.
 It should have 3 flat sides and one curved side.
 Insert it so the flat side faces up towards the cut you made earlier, and the curved part is facing down.
 It should resemble the mouthpiece on a recorder, or the reed on a wind instrument.
 You should now get a whistle. It should sound something like a train whistle.
 You can add more, but two is the ideal (3 tones). Three tones is enough to play simple tunes like Mary Had A Little Lamb, or Hot Cross Buns.
