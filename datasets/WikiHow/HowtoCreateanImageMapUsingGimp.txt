, GIMP will automatically offer to save this as a file with a .map extension. If you wish, you can save it as that. But this file contains the HTML code (no images) that we need to edit and copy over into our own web page, so it is recommended you save it as .html and skip directly to step 7.
 You may receive a warning about changing file extensions. Click yes to continue.
