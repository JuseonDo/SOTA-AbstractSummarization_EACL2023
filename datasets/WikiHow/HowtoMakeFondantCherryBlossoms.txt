 If wished, colour it pink or red, as follows:


To colour fondant, you'll need to get pink or red food colouring. Use gel or paste colouring, not the liquid type, as only the first two will work.
Take a toothpick and dab it into the colour and apply on the fondant.
Knead the colouring in until you get a solid colour throughout the fondant.;
, Have the flower cutters ready.
 Using the flower cutter, press into the fondant. Pull the cutter upward, then carefully pop the cut out of the cutter.
 Using a different toothpick and run it on to the petals creating a crease that a flower has.
 Place it the silver candy ball the center of your flower. This is the perfect finishing touch.
 Put it in the fridge; fondant is very delicate and will crack if you leave it out.
 To apply the flower on a cake, use royal icing to glue it in place.
