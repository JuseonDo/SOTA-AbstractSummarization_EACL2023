@summary
think carefully about the argument.

@summary
decide how major the argument was.

@summary
if it's your fault, apologize - if you apologize nicely and they are a true friend they should accept it.

@summary
if an argument was your fault and they didn't accept your apology, keep trying.

@summary
in the meantime, start hanging around with some other friends - but when (if) you and your friend make friends again, don't just drop the person or people you were hanging out with.

@summary

@summary
when all the apologies are said, hug and make up - there's no point leaving tension between the two of you.

@summary
make a promise to try not to argue as much - arguments between close friends cannot be avoided at most times, but they can be made not as worse and/or not as bad.

@summary
if you really and truly believe that the argument was their fault and it wasn't yours, but they think it is your fault for making it a big deal then try to sit down and have a conversation about your feelings with that person.

@summary
if they seem like they don't want anything to do with you, make sure you put it out there that you can survive, too.

 Think how it started, think how it ended up as a fall-out. Most of all, decide whether it was your fault or not - if it was, then you'll need to apologize; but if you're positive it is your friend's fault, never apologize. You can't let someone walk all over you, especially not a friend.
 If it's a 'minor' fight, you will make up (unless you argue all the time), but if it's a 'major' argument, you should consider whether you should completely leave your friend. A minor fight would be arguing about who gets the last sweet or something silly like that, and a major one would be them spreading one of your big secrets or an argument where violence is used.
 They might not accept it first time though. If you are certain that it's their fault, tell them that if they apologize you will accept it and be their friend again, and that you will apologize for any not nice thing you said.
 Make sure your apology is meaningful and sincere, rather than an angry murmur of 'Sorry'. If it wasn't your fault and they refuse to apologize, wait until they do.
, If it was their fault and they apologize, mostly you should apologize too; you probably said something mean to them in response to what they said.
 Remember that this is your friend and you must try not to say anything mean or lose your temper with them.
 Make sure you let that person have their turn telling how they feel too.;
, Hang out with your other friends. Show them that you are a strong person and even though you want to resolve the issue and be friends again, you can still live your life as though they weren't in it, because one day they will come back regretting what they did.
