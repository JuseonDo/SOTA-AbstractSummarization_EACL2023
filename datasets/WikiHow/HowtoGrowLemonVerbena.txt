 This herb needs regular pruning to prevent a build-up of dead wood and a scraggly look. Pruning will also accelerate new growth. Remove dead wood when pruning. Spring pruning will contain its growth, while pruning in any season will tidy it up.

 Harvest as required. The leaves make excellent tea. Use them wherever you might use lemon as well. Chopped or crushed leaves can be added to fish dishes, to cakes, to jams and jellies, and other foods needing a lemony touch. The leaves are also great in potpourri.
