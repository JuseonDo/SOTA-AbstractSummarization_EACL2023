 The elimination of any passive mob is not necessary.;
, This is what makes it all happen.
 If you accidentally put down two, break the top one. It must be the top one.
 You should have a boat rung around two walls.
 Add another one by tapping on the top. It will not fall all the way.
 Do not break the bottom or the boat will fall. Until you do break the bottom, you have a boat floating.
