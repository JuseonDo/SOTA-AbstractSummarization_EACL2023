 Take the beef (with bones) and lightly rub it with salt. You don't want it to be too salty. Keep aside for 10 to 15 minutes.
, Let it cook under pressure for 25 minutes., Check whether the beef is tender or not (it should be falling off the bones)., Cook it to a thicker consistency, ensuring that the curry is runny. Thus, do not over dry the beefâ€“-ensure that there are at least 1.5 glasses of water in as it cooks.,
