 The bright, fresh flavor from these popsicles comes from the orange zest. Use a zester, microplane or grater to zest an orange until you've collected 1 tablespoon.
 Place them all in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Lemonade or grapefruit juice also taste delicious in popsicle form.
You can sub the orange juice for root beer if you want a root beer float-inspired concoction.
, It will take at least 3 hours. Resist the temptation to take them out before they're hard - these popsicles melt quite easily!
