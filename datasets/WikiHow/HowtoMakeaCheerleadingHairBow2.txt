 Make sure there are no unnecessary twists in the ribbon.
 Pinch the middle with your thumb and forefinger and squish it all together. You're not creating an actual tie and bow, it just looks like it.
 Don't worry about the extra length of the twist tie; it'll be done away with later.
 This will be used to secure the hair tie to the ribbon piece. Try not to use too much -- you don't want to get yourself gloopy. The technical term!








, Hold it there for about 15 seconds. The longer, the better. Hot glue is generally permanent, so don't worry about your ribbon coming off.
 Make sure the hair tie is under the ribbon to secure it in place. If the twist tie is still too long, cut off the excess.










Optional: You can remove the twist tie once the glue has dried or keep it there for extra strength. And, if you so choose, you can take that 3 inches (7.6Â cm) of ribbon you cut out earlier and glue gun it over the twist tie to obscure it from view.
