 The 48 hour film festival happens once per year. Register a team with the competition.;
, Brainstorm ideas for each genre beforehand.
, As soon as the whistle blows, drive back to your home or studio. Now start brainstorming your story, integrating the elements you've been given. Write the script.
 It helps to have a blue or green screen in 48 hours. The benefit is that the entire film can be shot in one location. CGI's are also good like that, but you need to know you can create them within the time frame. Furthermore, the 48hrs officials can usually get permission for you to shoot in the locations you need, so use that to your advantage.
 You'll also need to convert your film to a mini DVD.
 The 48hrs officials do not accept late entries. Teams have been maliciously disqualified for being seconds late. There are also strict laws on disqualification, so reading through the rulebook could be a good idea.
