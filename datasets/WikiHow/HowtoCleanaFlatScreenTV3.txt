 If you have a large scratch that is covered by your warranty, your best option may be to exchange the TV for a new one. Proceeding to try to repair the scratch yourself may cause further damage that is not covered under your warranty.
 This is the safest method for removing a scratch from your screen. Repair kits are available for purchase where TVs are sold.
 Coat a cotton ball in petroleum jelly and dab it over the scratch.
 Buy clear lacquer and spray a small amount directly over the scratch. Allow it to dry.
