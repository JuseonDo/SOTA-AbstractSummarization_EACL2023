 Use the Digsite Pendant as the best way to travel. Stay here and harvest Bright Wisps until you reach level 30.
 The best way to get here is to use the Seers' Village Lodestone to teleport and then travel southeast, or travel north from the fairy ring code blur. Once here, harvest Glowing wisps until you reach level 40.
 To get here, use the Ring of Slaying to teleport to Fremennik Slayer Dungeon or use the fairy ring code air, and then run south. Here, harvest Sparkling wisps until you reach level 50.
 Your best travel option is getting to the Nature Altar using either Nature Tabs or the Wicked Hood. You can also use a Lodestone to teleport to Karamja and travel southeast. And you should bring some anti-poison. Here, harvest Gleaming Wisps until you reach level 60.
 Use the Ring of Duelling to arrive there, or use a spirit tree or the Mobilising Armies teleport. Then harvest Vibrant Wisps until you reach level 70.
