 Windows Vista and Windows 7 provide newsreaders in Windows Mail. In older versions of Windows, look for your newsreader in Outlook Express. Otherwise, access newsgroups through one of the many portals on the Internet. Some popular newsgroups include Usenet.org, Google Groups, and Yahoo! Groups. Mac users have various options to download, including Unison, NewsFire, and NewsHunter.;
, In Windows Mail, find "Newsgroups" under "Tools" on the Menu bar. If you're accessing newsgroups through another server, follow the instructions to create a newsgroup server account. Some public newsgroups require downloading a specific newsgroup reader. Others like Google Groups allow users to access Usenet through their site.
 These subjects can be as broad or specific as you want. For example, you can join a guitar group or a Rickenbacker guitar newsgroup. The newsgroup server will show all available newsgroups available on the server. In Windows Mail, choose a newsgroup, and click subscribe. Google Group users click on subjects, and then subcategories until finding the right one. Mac users can open up choices by clicking on a newsgroup so that a minus sign or downward arrow appears. Once a user finds a newsgroup to join, it's just a matter of clicking on subscribe.
 The search will reveal all groups that fit.
 With Google and Yahoo!, it's as simple as signing up with your email address .
 The newsgroup information will appear in your e-mail window if you are using Windows Mail or in your browser window. Some newsgroup servers also allow users the option of receiving news as separate emails or summarized in a digest format.
