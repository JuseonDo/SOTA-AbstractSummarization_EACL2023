 Every Windows systems has a version of Minesweeper on it. Minesweeper, once you learn how to play it, is very fun and addictive. Read the instructions by digging through the options bar at the top of the window.;
, Or you could take the time to make cards you might need to write up later. The more time on your hands the better you can make the cards!

, (A little tidbit: this version of Solitaire's real name is actually "Klondike".)

, Your icons with frequent computer usage will being to pile up, and unless you use every single one frequently or you need them on there for easy access, you'll need to clean them up. Organizing your desktop will also force you to organize your My Documents folder and therefore is a time-consuming process if you want it done right.
 (If you have a better-suited program, like Photoshop or Flash, use that.)

, If you have a copy of Madden, you can play that.
, There are a lot of better things to do that sit idly at a computer.
