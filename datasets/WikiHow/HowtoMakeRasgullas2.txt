 Pour into a heavy based pan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and allow to simmer.
 Stir through well. Stir until the whey water clears and the milk completely curdles.


Take a little whey water out and set aside.
 Add the ice cubes. Allow them to melt completely.
 Hold taught with an elastic band.
 The whey water will go into the bowl and the cloth will capture the curd. The curd will become "paneer".
 Wash under running water until you have removed the lemon odor. Squeeze out any excess water, then hang it up for 30 minutes to drip. Do not disturb it.
 It should have a crumbly appearance. Knead it well for 10 minutes until a smooth dough forms.
 Roll into balls about the size of a standard lemon. Set aside. You should be able to make about 13-15 mini balls.
 Add sugar to taste and cardamom powder. Keep stirring until the sugar completely dissolves; this will make a sugar syrup.
 Add them slowly, one by one. Allow to simmer for 3 minutes. The balls will go to the corner, so keep shifting them back to the middle with a wooden spoon or spatula.
 Cook for 10 minutes. However, open every 3-4 minutes to ensure that the steam escapes and to prevent the sugar syrup from boiling over. After 10 minutes, you'll find that the balls have doubled in size.
 Remove from the heat. Allow to cool completely. Transfer to a serving dish.
 Place in the refrigerator to chill for an hour.
