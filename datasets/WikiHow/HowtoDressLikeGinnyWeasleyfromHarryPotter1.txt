 You don't need to dye your hair but if you want to, go to the hairdresser or get someone else to dye it for you. Or, get a wig. If you hair is curly, just straighten it. If your hair is wavy it is still OK. In the books, Ginny has wavy hair.;
, Some hairstyles you'll find her in are straight ponytails, down with some strands pinned back to the side with a bobby pin or a simple barrette, or just straight down with a wide headband. On one occasion, however, (Slughorn's Christmas party) she was seen with slightly wavy hair.
