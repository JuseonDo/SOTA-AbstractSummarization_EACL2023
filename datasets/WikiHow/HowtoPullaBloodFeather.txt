 Its back should be against your palm. Hold the bird tightly as you don't want it to be moving around a lot. Hold the bird's head so that it is between your index and your middle finger. If you use the towel right, the bird will bite the towel instead of your fingers.;
, This does take some practice.
 Using pliers, grab the stem of the blood feather as close to the skin as you can get, making a very firm grip.
 Do not be afraid to pull. Pulling slow will cause more pain and may further damage the feather.
 Use cornstarch or a bar of soap to help the wound clot.
