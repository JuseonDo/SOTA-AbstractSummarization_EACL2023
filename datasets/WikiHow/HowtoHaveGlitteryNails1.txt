 This doesn't have to be clear, you can make it any colour as long as the glitter will show up on top of the nail varnish!;
, Consider rubbing some petroleum jelly around your nails and on your fingertips so the glitter that gets on will come off easily.
 Let them dry. Shake off any extra glitter on the paper. Repeat on other hand. How about Using some different colored glitter for each nail if you really want to make a fashion statement.
 Be careful, glitter can go everywhere!

, Done.
