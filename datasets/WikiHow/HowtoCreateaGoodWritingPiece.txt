 To have a good story, you need to plan what is going to be in it, before you start to write.;
, Every story needs a problem. Without a problem the plot would be very boring.
 A story without details would only be words, so you need to describe the scene, tell what the characters look like, tell how the characters feel, etc.
 Write or type up the story as you have it now.
 Review your piece and make any changes. After you do that get a parent or friend to review the piece for you. They can make any changes you miss.
