 The right sides should be facing each other.;
, Secure with straight pins.
 Use a sewing machine to sew along the entire lengths of the ribbons on both edges. Don't sew the ends closed. Turn the ribbon tube right side out.
 Use a ribbon 1 yard (91 cm) long and 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) wide.


Hook a safety pin into the end of the smaller ribbon. This will allow you to easily maneuver the smaller ribbon through the tube. Leave some of the smaller ribbon sticking out of both ends.
 Make knots before and after each bead to secure them.
, Scrunch up the tube until the folds resemble flower petals.
