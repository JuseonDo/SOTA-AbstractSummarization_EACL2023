 When you take your nightly shower (or morning), make sure to put lots of conditioner in.
, While rinsing it out, brush all the knots out.Â It'll make your hair so much easier the next morning, or throughout the day.
 Your hair is fragile, and in the shower it is even more so. Don't brush it with intensity (pulling, tugging, forcing) because it can damage your hair.
