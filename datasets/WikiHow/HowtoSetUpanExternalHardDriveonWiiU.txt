 Any external hard drive will do (which you can purchase from online retail stores as well as electronics stores near you), but it is recommended that you use a hard-disc drive (HDD) with a dedicated power sources (i.e., uses an A/C adapter) for maximum performance.;
, To turn off your Wii U, hold down the Power button on the gamepad for 1 second. The LED light of the console will turn red and the gamepad screen will turn off.


The Power button is at the bottom-right corner of the gamepad.
 Both will work just fine.
 Press the Power button of the Wii U to turn it on. Once the console is on, it will detect the external device, and a dialogue will prompt you to format the hard drive.
 After the formatting, the Wii U will now detect the external storage as an official storage device for your Wii U.
