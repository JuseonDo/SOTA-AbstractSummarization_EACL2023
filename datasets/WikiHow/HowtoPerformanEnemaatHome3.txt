 If a cleansing enema is a short stroll through the park, a retention enema is a long hike. Retention enemas are exactly what the name suggests they are: Instead of introducing the fluid and quickly expelling it and any other waste matter, you're supposed to hold it in for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. Common ingredients of retention enemas include:



Coffee. Normal brew works best, although instant can be used in a pinch. Coffee enemas are reputed to stimulate the colon and the gallbladder.Be sure to choose the right kind or you may stay up all night since the colon is very absorbent.
Probiotics. Reputedly good for yeast infections and other candidiasis.Any probiotic will do.
Red Raspberry Leaf. Supposedly beneficial for women, red raspberry leaf is high in iron and improves eyesight.Wheatgrass infusion. Supposed to replace friendly bacteria and help nourish the colon. It's the second part of a total colon cleanse.
 Retention enemas can feel great, but they have the power of causing more harm if done ineffectively. Make sure that whatever you're using is something that you'd feel comfortable swallowing.
 The process is exactly the same.
 Again, if you experience cramping, lightly massage the abdomen and try to find a comfortable position.
, Clean your equipment and let it air-dry before storage.
