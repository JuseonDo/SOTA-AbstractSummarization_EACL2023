 Gram flour with a small amount of self raising/rising wheat flour.
2. Mashed potato.
3. Mixed vegetables and spices, with chilies and chopped coriander. The best vegetables are onions chopped into small pieces, peas, small diced carrots.
Spices should include: ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, onion seeds.
 Mash using a ricer or a masher but be careful not to over-do the mashing as the potatoes will become sticky.
, Peas should be okay left raw. Add the spices to the onions while cooking. Add to the mix.
, Drop the mixture by spoon into the hot oil to create shapes about the size of a thumb. Keep the oil at around 160ºC and the pakora should become a beautiful golden colour after 10 to 15 minutes.
 Decorate with chopped coriander leaves.
