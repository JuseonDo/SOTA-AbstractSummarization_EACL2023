 Work in a well ventilated space, as you will be spray painting., Insert a fern pin to keep the boa in place., When you reach the end of the boa, insert another fern pin to keep it in place., Repeat the wrapping process until complete.,, Working on a covered area in a well ventilated space, spray paint the whole wreath with yellow spray paint. Do several light layers to cover. It doesn't matter if some feathers remain white, as this adds to the sense of baby chicken feathers., Fluff the feathers with your fingers. This step is important to prevent them from sticking together in a mass and looking lifeless. They'll also dry faster when separated.,, Try to get the feathers to fluff into the center and out to the sides, to give the wreath greater dimension., Make a coiled end in a piece of wire, leaving the rest straight and long enough to pierce through the wreath. Attach the plushie by pushing the wire piece through the plushie and into the wreath, at the point where you wish the plushie to sit. Push until the coil sits against the fabric of the plushie, then make another coil in the wire, trimming off any excess, leaving the rest of the wire sticking firmly into the wreath behind the coil stopper.

Alternatively, if using two plushies close together, wind the back wires around each other to keep them firmly in place.
 Make or purchase a large bow and attach with a fern pin., If hanging, add a ribbon loop for hanging or simply lean the wreath against a wall or other item.
