, You can buy them online, or put one together yourself. Make sure to include accurate Troughton style braces from the TV series and the bow tie. However, he didn't always wear the bow tie, so you have options here.
 You'll need a recorder (white with red diagonal stripes) and a silver penlight with no other colours than just silver to act as your sonic screwdriver.
 Have fun in your costume, and while you're at it watch the Second Doctor's story "The Tomb of the Cybermen". Seriously, it's good!
