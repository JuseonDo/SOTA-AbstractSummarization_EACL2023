 You should learn the ins and outs of your zombie paintball course. Make sure you learn exactly where to clock in, where belongings are to be stored, where armor is located, and where the zombies are to be once zombie paintball begins.
 Armor should be provided, including a helmet and chest/rib protection., You need to make sure you aren't seen by the "humans", so be discreet., This will probably involve a lot of standing around, so just have patience., Act like a zombie as you shuffle towards them., You want the humans to feel the satisfaction of shooting and killing a zombie, so crumple to the ground once they get a headshot in.,,,
