run your fingers over every key: play a chromatic scale and include every note and every key.

if a key is sticking, use a piece tobacco paper and put it in between the pad and instrument, hold the pad down firmly and slowly pull out.

@summary
tighten any loose rods with a small screwdriver - the ones in eyeglasses kits work great.

@summary
check your springs (the sharp, needle-like pieces sticking everywhere).

 Sometimes keys can stick open or closed and a quick tap will open them up.;
, A sticky note will also work for this, but never use a dollar bill, as they contain acids that will damage the pads.
 Be very careful when you do this it may change the way your instrument plays.
 Sometimes these can come unhooked during frenzied playing or otherwise and can be refastened relatively easily depending on the location and the obstacles to get to it. Be careful not to dislodge any others on your reach, bend any rods, or prick yourself.
 If it sounds healthy, put the mouthpiece onto the neck and play. Again, if it sounds OK, attach this to the body and try again. You can try to identify what section the problem may be arising from.
 Remove the neck and fashion the flashlight so it will shine into the body of the saxophone without any light escaping. Hold the sax and pretend to play a low Bb (as to close every hole in the instrument. You might have to have someone hold the flashlight). Cover the bell with a towel or something opaque. Turn on the flashlight. The light should shine through wherever there are leaks that you may have missed on your initial look-over. If you discover one, tighten any screws, fix any springs, or take your instrument to your local repair shop and show them your findings.
 If in doubt, and you have applied all of the above steps, go to a repair shop and list what you have checked. The person will be much happier for you giving them basic information, rather than testing it all themselves.
