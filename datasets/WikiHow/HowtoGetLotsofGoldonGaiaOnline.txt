 The daily chance cart is a great source of gold and other trinkets, and you can use them everyday. There is one on each main page (Home, My Gaia, Shops, Forums, World and Games).
, There is Booty Grab in aquariums and other games in the "Games" page. zOMG is one of my personal favorites, and you can get a lot of gold from it.
 Selling objects that you no longer want is a way to get gold and clean out your inventory, but you can also buy objects from the Marketplace when the price is low, and then resell them when the price is high.
 Collectibles are sold only temporarily and you can get a large sum of gold (Often more than 100,000) if you sell one on the Marketplace.
 This may be time consuming but it will pay off eventually if you have a reasonable amount of skill, as some people are willing to pay huge amounts of gold to get a piece of art.
